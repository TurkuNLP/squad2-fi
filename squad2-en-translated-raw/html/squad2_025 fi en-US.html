<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Montana i/mɒnˈtænə/ is a state
in the western United States. The state's name is derived <font color="#a9a9a9">from
the Spanish word montaña </font>(mountain). Montana has several
nicknames, though none official, such as &quot;Big Sky Country&quot;
and &quot;The Treasure State&quot;, as well as slogans including
&quot;Land of the Shining Mountains&quot; and more recently &quot;The
Last Best Place&quot;. Montana is <font color="#dcdcdc">4th</font> in
size but <font color="#2f4f4f">44th </font>in population and 48th in
population density out of 50 US states<font color="#dcdcdc">.</font>
The western third of Montana has numerous mountain ranges. Smaller
island mountain ranges are found throughout the state. The Rocky
Mountains include a total of <font color="#556b2f">77 </font>designated
mountain ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Montana schoolchildren played a
major role in the selection of several state symbols. Montana
schoolchildren overwhelmingly chose the state tree, the ponderosa
pine, in a <font color="#a9a9a9">1908 </font>referendum. However, the
legislature did not designate the state tree until <font color="#dcdcdc">1949,
</font>when the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs, with the support
of the state forester, advocated for its official recognition. In a
1930 vote, schoolchildren also selected the western meadowlark as the
state bird, and the Legislature upheld that decision in 1931.
Similarly, in 1981, the Secretary of State sponsored a children's
vote to select the state animal, and with 74 animals nominated, the
<font color="#556b2f">grizzly bear </font>beat the moose by a 2-1
vote. Livingston students launched a statewide school petition and
lobbied the governor and state legislators to have <font color="#6b8e23">Maiasaura
</font>designated as a state fossil in 1985.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The state song was not composed
until 21 years after the state's founding, when a musical group led
by Joseph E. Howard stopped in Butte in September <font color="#a9a9a9">1910</font>.
At a post-show celebration, a former member of the group living in
Butte asked Howard to compose a song about Montana and got another
reveler, Charles C. Cohan, editor of the Butte Miner newspaper, to
help. The men worked on the basic melody and lyrics in half an hour
to entertain the party guests, and finished the song later that
evening, with the arrangement completed the next day. On arrival in
Helena, Howard's troupe performed 12 encores of the new song to an
enthusiastic audience, and the Governor immediately proclaimed it a
state song, although it was not officially recognised by the
legislature until 1945. Montana is one of only three states with a
&quot;state ballad&quot;, &quot;Montana Melody&quot;, chosen by the
legislature in 1983. Montana was the first state to also adopt a
state lullaby.</p>

silver&quot; in </font>Spanish and recognises the important role of
mining, was adopted in <font color="#2f4f4f">1865, </font>when
Montana was still a territory. The state seal, which features a
miner's pick and shovel above the motto, surrounded by mountains and
the Missouri River Falls, was adopted by the first session of the
territory's legislature in 1864-65. The plan was modified only
slightly after Montana became a state and was adopted as the Great
Seal of the State of Montana, which was confirmed by the legislature
in 1893. The state flower, bitterroot, was adopted in <font color="#556b2f">1895
</font>with the support of a group called the Flower Seal
Association, which was formed after the Women's Christian Temperance
Union of Montana adopted <font color="#6b8e23">bitterroot </font>as
its organization's state flower. All other symbols were adopted
during the 20th century, except Montana's newest symbol, the state
butterfly, the mourning cloak, adopted in 2001, and the state
lullaby, &quot;Montana Lullaby&quot;, adopted in 2007.</p>

statistical areas, centred on Bozeman, Butte, Helena, Kalispell and
Havre. These communities, with the exception of Havre, are
colloquially known as Montana's &quot;seven big cities&quot; because
they are consistently the seven largest communities in Montana and
have a significant population difference when compared to the
communities ranked eighth and below on the list. According to the
2010 US Census, the seven most populous cities in Montana are, in

Spanish word Montaña, which means <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;mountain&quot;
</font>or, more broadly, &quot;mountain country&quot;. Early Spanish
explorers called the entire western mountain region <font color="#dcdcdc">Montaña
del Norte.</font> The name Montana was added to a bill proposed by
the US House of Representatives Committee on Territories, chaired at
the time by James Ashley of Ohio, for what would become the Territory
of Idaho. The name was successfully changed by Representatives Henry
Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who
complained that Montana had 'no meaning'. When Ashley introduced a
bill in 1864 to create a provisional government for the new territory
of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory. This time, Representative
Samuel Cox, also from Ohio, opposed the name. Cox complained that the
name was a misnomer because most of the territory was not mountainous
and that the Indian name would be more appropriate than the Spanish
name. Other names, such as Shoshone, were suggested, but it was
finally decided that the regional committee could name the territory
whatever they wanted, so the original name Montana was adopted.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The state's topography is roughly
defined by the continental divide, which divides much of the state
into separate eastern and western regions. Most of Montana's 100 or
more named mountain ranges are concentrated <font color="#a9a9a9">in
the western part of the state, </font>most of which are geologically
and geographically part of the northern Rocky Mountains. The Absaroka
and Beartooth Mountains in the south-central part of the state are
technically part of the Central Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountain
Front is a prominent feature in the northern and central parts of the
state, and there are several isolated island mountain ranges in the
central and eastern parts of the state that break up the prairie
landscape in the central and eastern parts of the state.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The northern part of the divide,
where the mountains give way rapidly to the prairies, is part of the
Rocky Mountain front. The front is strongest in the Lewis Range,
which is mainly located in Glacier National Park. Due to the
configuration of the mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the
Northern Divide (which starts on the Seward Peninsula in Alaska)
crosses this range and turns eastward in Montana at Triple Divide
Peak. It causes the Waterton, Belly and Saint Mary rivers to flow
<font color="#a9a9a9">north </font>into Alberta, Canada. There they
join the Saskatchewan River, which eventually flows into <font color="#dcdcdc">Hudson

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Montana Territory was formed on <font color="#a9a9a9">26
April 1864, </font>when the United States passed the Organic Act.
Schools began to form in the area even before it was officially a
territory, as families began to settle in the area. The first schools
were charter schools, usually held in the teacher's home. The first
official school was at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley in <font color="#dcdcdc">1862.</font>
The pupils were Indian children and children of Fort Owen workers.
The first school term began in early winter and lasted only until 28
February. The classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. The second early
charter school was founded by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in
1863. This school charged students <font color="#2f4f4f">$1.75 </font>a
week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly held its first
meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy
taxes for schools, setting the stage for public education. Madison
County was the first to take advantage of the newly passed taxes,
establishing the first public school in Virginia City in <font color="#556b2f">1886.</font>
The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but
severe weather delayed the opening until March. The first school year
lasted all summer and did not end until August 17. One of the first
teachers was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had
travelled to Virginia City by wagon train in 1865. To qualify as a
teacher, Raymond took an examination at her home and paid a $6 fee in
gold dust to receive a teaching certificate. With the help of an
assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was assigned to teach 50 to
60 of the school's 81 students daily. Sarah Raymond was paid $125 per

of the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods.
Other railroads followed suit. In 1902, the Reclamation Act was
passed, allowing the construction of irrigation projects in Montana's
eastern river valleys. In <font color="#2f4f4f">1909, </font>Congress
passed the Enlarged Homestead Act, which expanded the amount of
vacant land <font color="#556b2f">from </font>160 <font color="#556b2f">acres
to 320 acres </font>(0.6 to 1.3 square miles) per family, and in 1912
reduced the time required to &quot;prove&quot; a claim to three
years. In 1916, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act allowed 640 acres in
areas not suitable for irrigation.  This combination of advertising
and amendments to the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of
homesteaders who were attracted by free land, and during World War I
wheat prices were particularly high. In addition, Montana was
experiencing temporary above-average rainfall. The landowners who
arrived during this period were known as &quot;Honyockers&quot; or
&quot;scissorbills&quot;. Although the word &quot;honyocker&quot;,
possibly derived from the ethnic word &quot;hunyak&quot;, was used
derisively as a term for &quot;greenhorn&quot;, &quot;new to the

settlers had previous farming experience, although many had none.</p>

Punjab was part of the <font color="#556b2f">Indus Valley

The most important place in Punjab was the city of <font color="#a0522d">Harrapan</font>.
The Indus Valley civilisation covered a large part of present-day
Pakistan and eventually developed into the Indo-Aryan civilisation.
The Vedic civilisation flourished along the Indus River. This
civilisation shaped the later cultures of South Asia and Afghanistan.
Although the Harappa archaeological site was partially damaged in
<font color="#228b22">1857 </font>when engineers building the
<font color="#191970">Lahore-Multan Railway </font>used bricks from
the Harappa ruins as ballast for the tracks, a wealth of artefacts
have been found there. Punjab was part of great ancient empires,
including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Akhamenids, Macedonians,
Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas and Hindu Shahs. It also included for a time
the Gujar Empire, also known as the Gurjara-Pratihara Empire.

lush plains. After taking the north-eastern route, he marched against
the Aspii (<font color="#228b22">hill </font>tribes), who put up a
strong resistance but were defeated. Alexander then marched through
Ghazni, besieged Magassa and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning
north-east, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the
present-day Pahl region. He arrived in western Punjab, where the
ancient city of Nysa (on the site of present-day Mong) was located.
The warlike Cathians, the <font color="#191970">inhabitants of

deployed large numbers of troops and eventually killed <font color="#8b0000">seventeen

<font color="#a9a9a9">Muhammad bin Qasim </font>conquered <font color="#dcdcdc">Sindh
and southern Punjab in </font>712, defeating <font color="#2f4f4f">Raja

established after the death of Muhammad. It was ruled by the Umayyad
dynasty, whose name derives from the great-grandfather of the first
Umayyad caliph, Umayya ibn Abd Shams. Although the Umayyad family
originally came from Mecca, their capital was Damascus. Muhammad bin
Qasim was the first to bring the message of Islam to the people of
Punjab. The Punjab was part of various Muslim kingdoms composed of
Afghan and Turkic peoples in cooperation with local Punjabi tribes
and others. In the 1100s, during the reign of Mahmud Ghazni, the
province became an important centre, with Lahore as its second
capital and the second centre of the Ghaznavid empire, which operated
from Afghanistan. The Punjab region became predominantly
<font color="#556b2f">Muslim-dominated </font>thanks to the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the American Revolutionary
War, Richmond developed into a major industrial centre. To facilitate
the transfer of cargo from flat-bottomed boats above the fall line to
ocean-going vessels below, George Washington helped design the <font color="#dcdcdc">James
River and Kanawha River Canal </font>in the 1700s to bypass
Richmond's rapids, with the intention of providing a water route
across the Appalachians <font color="#2f4f4f">to the Kanawha River</font>.
The canal boatmen's legacy is represented by the figure in the center
of the city's flag. Thanks to this and the abundant availability of
hydroelectric power provided by the falls, Richmond became home to
some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country,
including railroads and flour mills, the largest of their kind in the
South. Opposition to the slave trade grew by the mid-19th century; in
one famous case in 1848, Henry &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Box</font>&quot;
Brown made history by nailing himself to a small box and transporting
it from Richmond to escape slavery in <font color="#6b8e23">Philadelphia</font>,

continued to flow into the city by canal and wagon for years to come,
as the city was protected by the Army of Northern Virginia and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A decade after the smouldering ruins
of the Civil War, Richmond re-emerged as an economic powerhouse with
iron-front brick houses and massive brick factories. Canal traffic
peaked in the 1860s and gradually gave way to <font color="#a9a9a9">railroads</font>,
making Richmond a major railroad crossroads, eventually hosting the
world's first <font color="#dcdcdc">triple </font>railroad crossing.
Tobacco storage and processing continued to play an important role,
helped by the world's first cigarette rolling machine, invented by
<font color="#2f4f4f">James Albert Bonsack </font><font color="#556b2f">of
Roanoke in </font>1880/81. Richmond's revival was helped by the
<font color="#6b8e23">Richmond Union Passenger Railway, the </font>first
successful electric trolley car system in the United States. The
trolley system, designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague,
opened its first line in 1888, and electric tram lines quickly spread
to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used overhead
wires and a carriage pole to collect power, and the carriages were
fitted with electric motors. Richmond switched from streetcars to
buses in May 1947 and completed the transition on 25 November 1949.</p>

<font color="#6b8e23">Maggie L. Walker </font>founded the St. Luke
Penny Savings Bank and served as its first president and the first
female bank president in the United States. Today, the bank is known
as Consolidated Bank and Trust Company and is the oldest surviving
African-American bank in the United States. Other figures of the time
included John Mitchell Jr. In 1910, the former City of Manchester was
incorporated into the City of Richmond, and in 1914 the city annexed
Barton Heights, Ginter Park and Highland Park in Henrico County. In
May 1914, Richmond became the headquarters of the Fifth District of
the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

the Greater Richmond area, with three more under construction to
cater for the growing Muslim population, the first of which is Masjid
Bilal. East End Muslims organised themselves in the 1950s under the
Nation of Islam (NOI). They met at <font color="#a9a9a9">Temple 24 on
</font>North Avenue. After the NOI disbanded in 1975, mainstream
Muslims who had joined Islam began meeting at the Shabaaz Restaurant
<font color="#dcdcdc">on Nine Mile Road.</font> By 1976, Muslims were
meeting in a rented church. They tried to buy the church, but due to
financial difficulties, the Muslims instead bought an old grocery
store <font color="#2f4f4f">on Chimbarazoo Boulevard</font>, the site
of the current Masjid Bilal. Initially the place was called &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Masjid
Muhammad #24</font>&quot;. It was not until 1990 that the Muslims
renamed it &quot;Masjid Bilal&quot;. Masjid Bilal was succeeded by
the Islamic Center of Virginia, ICVA Masjid. ICVA was founded in 1973
as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization<font color="#6b8e23">.</font>
Through aggressive fundraising, ICVA was able to purchase land on

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Richmond has a significant arts
community, some of which operates in formal publicly supported venues
and others more DIY, such as local privately owned galleries and
private music venues, non-profit arts organizations, or organic and
tax-exempt art shops (e.g., <font color="#a9a9a9">home shows</font>,
busking events, touring folk music performances). This has led to
tensions, as the City of Richmond City introduced an 'admission fee'
to fund large-scale arts projects such as <font color="#dcdcdc">CentreStage,
which has </font>attracted criticism for funding civic initiatives at
the expense of organic local culture. Traditional Virginia folk
music, such as blues, <font color="#2f4f4f">country </font>and

particular, has welcomed theatrical performances since the earliest
days. From the early Shakespeare performances of Lewis Hallam <font color="#a9a9a9">in
Williamsburg, </font>the Richmond theatre moved into the pre-medieval
period, when it was the principal performance venue of the colonial
and early 19th century, hosting such famous American and English
actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest and the <font color="#dcdcdc">Booth
</font>family. Richmond's love of theatre continued into the 20th
century with many amateur groups and regularly touring professional
productions. A small renaissance or golden age began in the 1960s
with the rise of professional dinner theatres and the promotion of
theatre by the Virginia Museum. It reached its peak in <font color="#2f4f4f">the
1970s</font>, when the Virginia Museum Theater (now <font color="#556b2f">Leslie

architectural features is its cast iron architecture. The city is
second <font color="#a9a9a9">only to New Orleans in the </font>amount
of cast iron work, and has a unique collection of cast iron porches,
balconies, fences and ornaments. Richmond's position as a center of
iron production contributed to its popularity in the city. At the
peak of production in <font color="#dcdcdc">1890, the </font>city had
25 foundries employing nearly 3,500 metalworkers. This number is
<font color="#2f4f4f">seven times </font>the number of general
construction workers employed in Richmond at the time, demonstrating
the importance of its iron exports. Porches and fences in
neighbourhoods such as Jackson Ward, <font color="#556b2f">Church
Hill </font>and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate, often
featuring decorative iron castings never made outside Richmond. In
some cases, the cast iron was made for a single residential or

These postulates were first used when it was discovered that
tuberculosis was caused by mycobacterial species. Koch's postulates
are not ethically applicable to many human diseases because <font color="#556b2f">they
require the experimental infection of a healthy individual with a
</font>pathogen produced in pure culture. Often even clearly
infectious diseases do not meet the criteria for infection. For
example, <font color="#6b8e23">Treponema pallidum</font>, the
spirochete that causes syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - but
the organism can be cultured in rabbit testicles. It is less clear
that a pure culture is from a host animal source than if it is from
microbes derived from algal culture. Epidemiology is another
important tool for studying diseases in populations. In the case of
communicable diseases, it can be used to determine whether an
epidemic is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular
occurrences that occur frequently in an area), epidemic (an unusually
high number of cases in an area) or pandemic (a worldwide epidemic).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Wound colonisation refers to the
<font color="#a9a9a9">presence of non-proliferating microorganisms in
the wound, whereas </font>infected wounds have <font color="#dcdcdc">proliferating
</font>organisms and tissue damage. All multicellular organisms are
colonised to some extent by <font color="#2f4f4f">external organisms,
</font>and most of these have either a mutualistic or commensal
relationship with the host. An example of the former is the <font color="#556b2f">anaerobic

and an example of the latter is the various species of staphylococcus
found on human skin. Neither of these colonisations are considered
infections. The difference between infection and colonisation is
often <font color="#6b8e23">simply a matter of circumstances</font>.
Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic under certain
conditions, and even the most virulent organism requires certain
conditions to cause a dangerous infection. Some colonising bacteria,
such as Corynebacteria sp. and viridans streptococci, inhibit the
attachment and colonisation of pathogenic bacteria and are thus in a
symbiotic relationship with the host, preventing infection and
accelerating wound healing.</p>

</font>culture is the main tool used to diagnose infectious diseases<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Microbial culture provides a culture medium for a specific
pathogen. A sample of potentially infected tissue or fluid is then
tested for the presence of an infectious agent capable of growing in
it. Most pathogenic bacteria grow readily <font color="#2f4f4f">on
nutrient agar</font>, a solid medium containing carbohydrates and
proteins essential for bacterial <font color="#556b2f">growth</font>,
as well as plenty of water. A single bacterium grows on the surface
of the plate into a visible mound called <font color="#6b8e23">a
colony, which </font>may be isolated from other colonies or merge
together to form a 'lawn'. The size, colour, shape and form of the
colony are specific to the bacterial species, its particular genetic
structure (strain) and the environment in which it grows. Other
components are often added to the plate to aid identification. Plates
may contain substances that allow some bacteria to grow but not
others, or that change colour under the influence of some bacteria
but not others. Such bacteriological plates are commonly used in the
clinical identification of infectious bacteria. Microbial culture can
also be used to identify viruses: in this case, the viable medium is
cells grown in culture, which can be infected and then transformed or
killed by the virus. In virus identification, the growth of the virus
results in an area of dead cells called a <font color="#a0522d">&quot;plaque&quot;.</font>
Eukaryotic parasites can also be grown in culture to identify a

the diagnosis of infectious diseases </font>is microscopy. Almost all
the cultivation techniques discussed above rely at some stage on
<font color="#dcdcdc">microscopic examination </font>for definitive

with simple instruments such as <font color="#2f4f4f">a light

treatment or prevention of the disease, or when it can improve
knowledge of the disease process before effective treatment or
prevention measures are developed. For example, in the early 1980s,

the course of the disease was closely monitored <font color="#dcdcdc">by
monitoring the composition of patients' blood samples, </font>even
when the result offered no other treatment options for the patient.
In part, these studies on the prevalence of HIV in specific
communities allowed hypotheses to be put forward about the route of

</font><font color="#556b2f">to be targeted at communities at

the development of hypotheses about the temporal and <font color="#6b8e23">geographical

The development of molecular diagnostic tools has enabled doctors and
researchers to monitor the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs.
<font color="#a0522d">Molecular diagnostics is </font>now commonly
used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of the
disease and has shown that there are people who are genetically
resistant to HIV infection. So although there is still no cure for

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">One way to <font color="#a9a9a9">prevent
or slow down </font><font color="#dcdcdc">the spread of infectious
diseases </font>is to recognise the different characteristics of
different diseases. Some critical disease characteristics that should
be assessed are <font color="#2f4f4f">virulence, distance travelled
by victims and degree of transmission. </font>For example, human
strains of the Ebola virus incapacitate their victims very quickly
and kill them shortly afterwards. As a result, victims of this
disease are unable to travel very far from their original infected
area. In addition, the virus must be spread through skin lesions or
permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial phase of Ebola
is not very contagious, as its <font color="#6b8e23">victims only
have internal bleeding. </font>Due to the above characteristics,
<font color="#a0522d">Ebola </font>spreads very rapidly and tends to
remain within a relatively limited geographical area. In contrast,
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly
by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims
spread the virus to other people before they even realise they have
the disease. In addition, the relatively low viral load allows its
victims <font color="#228b22">to travel long distances</font>,
increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Another effective way to reduce <font color="#a9a9a9">the
rate of spread of infectious diseases </font>is to recognise the
impact of small world networks. Epidemics often involve <font color="#dcdcdc">extensive
interactions </font>within nodes or groups of infected individuals
and interactions within discrete nodes of susceptible individuals.
Despite the low level of interaction between separate nodes, the
disease may move to a susceptible node and spread there through one
or a few interactions with an infected node. Thus, in small networks,
infection rates can be reduced to some extent if interactions between
individuals within infected nodes are removed (Figure 1). However,
infection rates can be significantly reduced if the <font color="#556b2f">focus

It is also associated with higher preferences for health and
attractiveness in partners. Higher fertility rates and shorter or
less parental care per child is another association that may
compensate for higher mortality. There is also an association with
polygyny, which may be due to a higher pathogen load, making the
selection of genetically resistant males increasingly important. A
higher pathogen load is also associated with collectivism and less
individualism, which may limit contact with outside groups and
infections. There are alternative explanations for at least some of
the links, although some of these explanations may ultimately be due
to pathogen load. Thus, polygyny may also be due to lower
male-to-female ratios in these areas, but this may ultimately be due
to higher mortality from infectious diseases in male babies. Another

<font color="#dcdcdc">hunting </font>was generally a major factor <font color="#556b2f">in

<font color="#dcdcdc">upper class </font>had exclusive <font color="#2f4f4f">hunting

game was used as a source of <font color="#556b2f">food and fur</font>,

was also expected to provide a form of <font color="#228b22">recreation

</font>scriptures, hunting is described as <font color="#dcdcdc">an

are described as having practised <font color="#2f4f4f">hunting</font>.
One of the names of the Shiva god is <font color="#556b2f">Mrigavyadha,
</font>which means <font color="#6b8e23">'</font><font color="#a0522d">deer
hunter</font><font color="#6b8e23">' </font>(mriga means deer, vyadha
means hunter). In many Indian languages, including Malayalam, the
word Mriga means not only deer but all animals and animal instincts
(Mriga Thrishna). Shiva as Mrigavyadhana is the one who destroys
<font color="#228b22">animal instincts </font><font color="#191970">in
humans. </font>In the Ramayana epic, Dasharatha, the father of Rama,
is said to have the ability <font color="#8b0000">to hunt </font><font color="#483d8b">in
the dark. </font>On one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally
killed <font color="#3cb371">Shravana</font>, thinking him to be
prey. While Rama was in exile <font color="#bc8f8f">in the forest,
</font>Ravana kidnapped his wife Sita from their hut, when Rama asked
Sita to catch a golden deer and his brother Lakshman went after him.
According to Mahabharat, Pandu, the father of the Pandavas,
accidentally killed Kindama, the druid, and his wife with an arrow,
mistaking them for deer. Krishna is said to have <font color="#663399">died

hunting </font><font color="#2f4f4f">on horseback with hounds </font>is
the form of hunting most closely associated with <font color="#556b2f">the
United Kingdom</font>; in fact, &quot;hunting&quot; means fox hunting
without specification. What is called 'hunting' in other countries is
'shooting' (<font color="#6b8e23">birds</font>) or 'stalking' (deer)
in the UK. Originally, fox-hunting became a popular social activity
for the <font color="#483d8b">newly wealthy upper classes in the
</font><font color="#3cb371">Victorian </font>era, and a <font color="#bc8f8f">traditional
rural pastime for </font>both horse riders and foot soldiers alike.
In many ways, fox-hunting resembles hare-hunting with hounds. Hares
can be <font color="#663399">chased </font>using pairs of greyhounds
(or long dogs) such as greyhounds, which demonstrate their skill at
chasing the hare (but are not intended to catch the hare), or the
hare can be chased with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers.
Other types of foxhounds can also be used to hunt deer or mink. Deer<font color="#008080">
hunting </font>with a rifle is done <font color="#bdb76b">on foot,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#dcdcdc">Trinidad and
Tobago has a </font>very active <font color="#a9a9a9">tradition of
hunting small and medium-sized wild game</font>. Hunting is carried
out with firearms and <font color="#2f4f4f">dog harnesses, as </font>well
as the illegal use of traps, snares and trap nets. In recent years,
some <font color="#556b2f">12,000 </font>sport hunters have applied
for hunting licenses (in a very small country, about the size of the
state of Delaware, with about 5,128 square kilometers and 1.3 million
inhabitants), so there is some concern that the practice may not be
sustainable. In addition, there are currently no bag limits and the
open season is relatively long (5 months - October to February).
Thus, the pressure on legal hunters to hunt is very <font color="#6b8e23">high</font>.
In addition, the black market for <font color="#a0522d">poached wild
game </font>(eagerly sold and bought as expensive luxury delicacies)
is thriving and very productive, and the number of commercial
poachers is unknown but is expected to be <font color="#228b22">quite
high</font>. As a result, the populations of the five main mammal
species (red-tailed hawk, Dutch bluebird, nine-toed armadillo,
collared peccary and red-tailed deer) are believed to be quite low
(although scientific population studies have only recently been
conducted, since 2013). It appears that the red-tailed deer
population has disappeared from Tobago as a result of over-hunting. A
variety of herons, ducks, pigeons, green iguanas, golden tegus, reed
buntings and possums are also commonly hunted and poached. Poaching
also targets &quot;fully protected species&quot; such as red howler
monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian
porcupines, yellow-legged turtles, Trinidadian piping plovers and
even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay
<font color="#8b0000">very small fees </font>to obtain hunting
permits and receive no formal <font color="#483d8b">training in
</font>conservation biology or <font color="#483d8b">basic hunting
ethics.</font> It is assumed that there is relatively little
subsistence hunting in the country (most people hunt either for sport
or for commercial gain). The local wildlife management authority is
<font color="#3cb371">understaffed and underfunded, and as a result
there </font>is little enforcement of existing wildlife management
laws, and hunting <font color="#bc8f8f">takes place both during and
outside the hunting season </font>and even in wildlife reserves.
There are some indications that the government is starting to take
wildlife management more seriously, and a well-drafted bill was
presented to Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen whether the
current and future governments will fully accept and financially
support the draft law, and whether the public will raise awareness of
the importance of wildlife conservation and transform a culture of
wasteful consumption into one of sustainable management.</p>

According to Gopalraj Vansawal, a genealogy of Nepalese rulers, the
rulers of the Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were the Gopalas,
Mahispalas, Aabhirs, Kirants and Somavanshes. The Kirata dynasty was
founded by <font color="#a9a9a9">Yalamber</font>. During the Kirata
period, a settlement called Yambu was located north of old Kathmandu.
In some <font color="#2f4f4f">Sino-Tibetan </font>languages,
Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called
Yengal was located <font color="#556b2f">in the south of </font>old
Kathmandu, near Manjupattan. During the reign of Jitedast, the

From Sankhu they migrated to Yambu and Yengali (Lanjagwal and
Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries
in Kathmandu. This laid the foundation for Newar Buddhism, the

designed in the shape of <font color="#2f4f4f">Manjushri's </font>sword,
Chandrahrasa. The city was surrounded by <font color="#556b2f">eight
</font>barracks guarded by Ajimat. One of these barracks is still in
use at Bhadrakal (in front of Singha Durbar). The city served as an
important transit point for trade between <font color="#6b8e23">India
and Tibet</font>, which led to a huge growth in architecture.
Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan and
Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving diaries of
travellers and monks of this period. For example, the famous 7th
century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan, the
palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma. The trade route also led to
cultural exchanges. The artworks of the Newar people - the indigenous
people of the Kathmandu Valley - were highly sought after at the
time, both in the valley and throughout the Himalayas. Newar artists
travelled widely throughout Asia, creating religious art for their
neighbours. Araniko, for example, led a group of his compatriots
across Tibet and China. Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal, who married the
Tibetan ruler Songtsän Gampo, was instrumental in bringing Buddhism
to Tibet.</p>

after the Muslim invasion of the Kathmandu Valley in the north. They

again rose to prominence and dominated trade between India and Tibet

there were <font color="#a9a9a9">four </font>fortified cities in the
Kathmandu Valley: <font color="#dcdcdc">Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur

aesthetics and trade, leading to tremendous development. The kings of
this period directly contributed to or participated in the
construction of public buildings, plazas and temples, as well as the
development of water troughs, the institutionalisation of trusts
(called guths), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas and
the staging of plays in town squares. Evidence of ideas coming from

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The National Museum is located in a
historic building in the western part of Kathmandu, near the
Swayambhunath stupa. The building was built in the early 19th century
by General <font color="#2f4f4f">Bhimsen Thapa</font>. It is the
country's most important museum, with a large collection of
historically and culturally significant weapons, art and antiquities.
The museum was established in <font color="#556b2f">1928 </font>as a
collection centre for war trophies and weapons, and was originally
named Chhauni Silkhana, meaning '<font color="#6b8e23">Stone House of
Arms and Ammunition</font>'. Because of the museum's focus, it houses
a large number of weapons, including locally made firearms used in
wars, leather guns from the 1700s and 1900s, and medieval and modern
wood, bronze, stone and paintings.</p>

infarction (MI) </font>or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly

the middle or left side of the chest and lasts for <font color="#2f4f4f">more

heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea,
weakness, cold sweats or a feeling of tiredness. Around <font color="#556b2f">30%

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Most heart attacks are caused by
coronary heart disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure,
smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol,
poor diet and excessive alcohol consumption. The mechanism of
myocardial infarction often involves complete blockage of the
coronary artery due to <font color="#a9a9a9">rupture of the
atherosclerotic plaque</font>. Myocardial infarctions are less
commonly caused by <font color="#dcdcdc">coronary artery spasms</font>,
which can be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress and extreme
cold, among other things. Several tests such as <font color="#2f4f4f">ECGs</font>,
blood tests and coronary angiography help to make the diagnosis. An
ECG can confirm ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction if ST
elevation is present. Commonly used <font color="#6b8e23">blood tests

700112525000000000000000000000000♠12.5 MeV/c2, which is small
compared to the mass of a nucleon (about
70029380000000000000000000000000000♠938 MeV/c2). The upshot is that
most of the mass of an everyday object comes from the interaction

the early 20th century and particle physics was born, matter was
thought to be made up of <font color="#dcdcdc">electrons, protons and
neutrons, which </font>interacted with each other to form atoms.
Today we know that even <font color="#2f4f4f">protons and neutrons
</font>are not <font color="#556b2f">indivisible</font>, but can be

electromagnetism, weak interaction and strong interaction. <font color="#dcdcdc">The
Standard Model of </font>particle physics is currently the best
explanation of all physics, but despite decades of effort, gravity
cannot yet be explained at the quantum level and is only described by
classical physics (see quantum gravity and graviton). Interactions
between quarks and leptons are the result of the exchange of
<font color="#2f4f4f">force-carrying particles </font>(such as
photons) between quarks and leptons. The force-carrying particles are
not themselves building blocks. It follows that mass and energy
(which cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to
<font color="#556b2f">matter </font>(which can be created from
immaterial particles such as photons, or even pure energy such as
kinetic energy). Force carriers are generally not considered to be
matter: electric force carriers (photons) have energy (see <font color="#6b8e23">Planck's
</font>relation) and weak force carriers (W and Z bosons) are
massive, but neither is considered to be matter. Although these
particles are not considered matter, they do contribute to the total
mass of atoms, subatomic particles and all systems containing them.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Norman dynasty had a major
<font color="#a9a9a9">political, cultural and military </font>impact
on medieval Europe and even the Middle East. Famous for their warlike
spirit and, eventually, for their Christian piety, the <font color="#dcdcdc">Normans
</font>became the representatives of the <font color="#2f4f4f">Catholic
</font><font color="#556b2f">orthodoxy </font>into which they merged.
They adopted the Gallo-Romanic language of the Frankish region they
inhabited, and their dialect became an important literary language
known as Norman, Normanund or Norman French. The Duchy of Normandy,
which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was the great
fiefdom of medieval France, and under <font color="#6b8e23">Richard
I, </font>Normandy became a unified and powerful feudal principality.
The Normans are known both for their culture, such as their unique
Romanesque architecture and musical tradition, and for their
outstanding military achievements and innovations. The Norman
adventurers, under Roger II, founded the Kingdom of Sicily after
conquering southern Italy from the Saracens and Byzantines, and their
campaign <font color="#a0522d">led by </font>their duke <font color="#a0522d">William
the Conqueror </font>led to the Norman conquest of England at the

spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the
Middle East, where their Prince Bohemond I established the

covered the northern part of what is now Upper Normandy up to <font color="#191970">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Robert
Guiscard</font>, another Norman adventurer who had already risen to
the rank of Count of Apulia thanks to his military successes, finally
drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy. After obtaining the
consent of <font color="#dcdcdc">Pope Gregory VII </font>and acting
as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign to conquer the Balkan
peninsula as a base for Western feudal lords and the Catholic Church.
After joining Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he
led an army of <font color="#2f4f4f">30,000 </font>men on 300 ships
that landed on the southern coast of Albania, conquered Valona,
Kanina, Jericho (Orikum) and reached Butrint after numerous raids.
They joined the fleet that had earlier conquered Corfu and attacked
Dyrrachium from land and sea, destroying everything along the way.
Under these harsh conditions, the locals accepted the invitation of
Emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join the Byzantine forces against the
Normans. The Albanian troops could not take part in the next battle,
as it had begun before their arrival. Immediately before the battle,
the Venetian fleet had won a victory on the coast around the city.
Forced to retreat, Alexius handed over command to a high Albanian
official in Byzantine service named Comiscortes. The garrison of the
city resisted until <font color="#556b2f">February </font><font color="#6b8e23">1082</font>,
when Venetian and Amalfi merchants who had settled there betrayed
<font color="#a0522d">Dyrrachium </font>into Norman hands. The
Normans were now free to invade inland; they took Ioannina and some
smaller towns in south-west Macedonia and Thessaly before arriving at
the gates of Thessaloniki. Disagreements among high officials forced
the Normans to retreat into Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona and
Butrint in 1085, after Robert's death.</p>

of <font color="#a0522d">Ireland</font>, later known as the Pale, and
also built many fine castles and settlements, such as <font color="#228b22">Trim
Castle and Dublin Castle.</font> The two cultures intermingled and
borrowed each other's language, culture and outlook on life. The
descendants of the Normans are now recognised by their surnames.
Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy
are particularly common in the south-east of Ireland, especially in
the south of County Wexford, where the first Norman settlements were
established. Other Norman names such as Furlong also occur there.
Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from
the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from
the Norman word for 'son') suggest a Norwegian ancestry. These
included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice.
Other families with surnames such as Barry (de Barra) and De Búrca
(Burke) are also of Norwegian origin.</p>

Henry I of England (who was married to David's sister Maud) and
needed them to wrest the kingdom from his half-brother Máel Coluim
mac Alaxandair, he had to reward many with lands. The process
continued under David's successors, most intensely under William the
Lion. The Norman feudal system was applied, to varying degrees, to
most of Scotland. The Scottish families of Bruce, Gray, Ramsay,
Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and

French objects as donations to the churches where they stopped in

deal was struck, ITV applied to the High Court for an injunction,
believing that its bid details had been leaked before the decision
was made. ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate
the case because it believed that Rupert Murdoch's media empire,

neither action was successful, as ITV believed BSkyB had been called

BSkyB to increase its counter-offer.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Prior to European settlement, the
current area of Victoria was home to a large number of Aboriginal
peoples, collectively known as the <font color="#a9a9a9">Kori</font>.
In <font color="#dcdcdc">1788, </font>after Britain claimed the whole
of the Australian mainland east of the 135th meridian, Victoria was
incorporated into the larger colony of <font color="#2f4f4f">New
South Wales</font>. The first settlement in the area occurred in <font color="#556b2f">1803
</font><font color="#6b8e23">at Sullivan Bay</font>, and much of what
is now Victoria was incorporated into Port Phillip District in 1836,
the administrative division of <font color="#a0522d">New South Wales</font>.
Victoria was formally established as a separate colony in 1851 and
became self-governing in 1855. The Victorian gold rush of the 1850s
and 1860s significantly increased both the colony's population and
its prosperity, and by the time of the Australian federal government
in 1901, Melbourne had become Australia's largest city and leading
economic centre. Melbourne also served as Australia's capital until
Canberra was built in 1927, with the Federal Parliament meeting in
Melbourne's Parliament House and all the main offices of the Federal
Government located in Melbourne.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Originally a <font color="#a9a9a9">derisive
</font>term for Huguenot, the origin of which is unclear. Various
hypotheses have been put forward. The nickname may have been an
associated reference to the Swiss politician <font color="#dcdcdc">Besançon
Hugues </font>(d. <font color="#2f4f4f">1532) </font>and the
religiously controversial nature of the Swiss republic of his time.
The Lemp name was a clever pun on the Hugues name <font color="#556b2f">using
the </font>Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally &quot;<font color="#556b2f">fellow
countrymen&quot;)</font>, which referred to the meaning of the German
word Eidgenosse (allies, as in &quot;citizen of one of the Swiss
federal states&quot;), which is somewhat related. <font color="#6b8e23">Geneva
</font>was the adoptive home of John Calvin and the centre of the
Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues was a <font color="#a0522d">Catholic</font>,
but he led the 'Confederate Party', so called because it advocated
independence from the Duke of Savoy through a union between the City
State of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The term Huguenot was
reportedly first used in France to refer to the conspirators (all
aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in <font color="#8b0000">the
</font><font color="#483d8b">1560 </font><font color="#8b0000">conspiracy
</font>at <font color="#191970">Amboise</font>: a failed attempt to
take power in France from the powerful House of Guise. The move would
have had the side effect of promoting relations with the Swiss. Thus,
Hugues plus Eidgenosse through Huisgenote presumably became a
Huguenot, a nickname that associated the Protestant cause with
unpopular politics in France[citation needed].</p>

It was named New Rochelle after <font color="#8b0000">La Rochelle</font>,
their former base in France. A small wooden church was first erected
in the community, followed by a second church built of stone. Before
the church was erected, the strong men often walked the <font color="#483d8b">twenty-three
miles</font>, the length of the road between New Rochelle and New
York, on Saturday night to attend Sunday services. The church was
eventually replaced by a third, <font color="#3cb371">Trinity-St.
Paul's Episcopal Church</font>, which houses heritage items,
including the original bell from the French Huguenot church &quot;<font color="#bc8f8f">Eglise
du St. Esperit&quot; </font>on Pine Street in New York City, which is
kept as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot Burial Ground has
since been recognised as a historic cemetery, the final resting place

from over three centuries.</p>

worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing the steam under the

hitherto been impossible, and also to produce reusable water to run
water wheels in factories far from a suitable 'head'. The water that
went over the wheel was pumped back into a storage tank above the
wheel.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The logical extension of the
combined engine described above is to split the expansion into even
more stages to increase efficiency. The result is a multiple
expansion engine. Such motors use either <font color="#a9a9a9">three
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">or four </font>expansion stages and are
called triple and <font color="#2f4f4f">quadruple </font><font color="#556b2f">expansion
motors </font>respectively. These engines use several cylinders of
progressively increasing diameter. The cylinders are designed so that
the work is divided into equal parts for each expansion stage. As
with a double expansion engine, if space is limited, two smaller
cylinders can be used for the low pressure stage. In multi-expansion
engines, the cylinders were typically arranged in a row, but various
other configurations were also used. The Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy
balancing system (Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy) was used in the late 19th
century in some <font color="#a0522d">triple expansion marine
</font><font color="#228b22">engines.</font> Y-S-T engines split the
low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end
of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced,
resulting in a smoother and more responsive engine that ran with less
vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple expansion engine popular
on large passenger ships (such as <font color="#8b0000">the Olympic
class), </font>but eventually it was replaced by a virtually
vibration-free turbine engine.</p>

method to reduce this heating and cooling and patented Woolf's
high-pressure compound engine in 1805. In a compound engine,
high-pressure steam from a boiler is expanded in a high-pressure
cylinder (HP cylinder) and then fed into one or more subsequent
low-pressure cylinders (LP cylinder). Complete expansion of the steam
now takes place in several cylinders, and because the expansion is
now less in each cylinder, the steam loses less heat in each
cylinder. This reduces the amount of heating and cooling of the
cylinders, increasing engine efficiency. By staggering the expansion
across multiple cylinders, <font color="#2f4f4f">torque variation </font>can
be reduced. Getting the same work out of low pressure steam requires
a larger <font color="#6b8e23">cylinder volume because the </font>steam
volume is larger. Therefore, the diameter and often the stroke volume

generation), but the recent large-scale use of large gas turbine
units and typical combined cycle power plants has led to a reduction

In power generation, the high rotational speed of turbines is very
similar to that of modern electric generators, as they are typically

turbines </font><font color="#6b8e23">with reduction gearing

and <font color="#483d8b">gas turbines </font>have almost completely

The cycle is a combination of components, typically used for simple
power generation, that exploits water phase change (boiling water
produces steam, condensing exhaust steam produces liquid water) to
create a practical heat and power conversion system. The heat is fed
externally into a closed loop, where part of the added heat is
converted into work and the waste heat is <font color="#2f4f4f">removed

</font>It used condensing steam to create <font color="#6b8e23">a

used steam pressure to raise the water higher. Small engines were
efficient, but larger models were problematic. They had a limited
lift height and were prone to boiler explosions. The engine was used
to some extent in mines, pumping stations and to feed water wheels
used to power textile machinery. An attractive feature of the Savery
engine was its low price. <font color="#a0522d">Bento de Moura

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A steam turbine consists of one or
more rotors (<font color="#a9a9a9">rotating discs) </font>mounted <font color="#2f4f4f">on
a drive shaft </font>and alternating with stators (<font color="#556b2f">stators</font><font color="#6b8e23">)
</font>mounted on a <font color="#228b22">turbine housing.</font> The
outer edge of the rotors has a propeller-like arrangement of blades.
Steam acts on these blades to produce rotary motion. The stator
consists of a similar but fixed set of blades whose function is to
direct the flow of steam to the next rotor stage. The steam turbine
often leads the exhaust gas to a surface condenser forming a vacuum.
The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the
maximum amount of work for a given steam velocity and pressure,
resulting in a series of high and low pressure stages of varying
sizes. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high
speeds, and are therefore usually coupled to reduction gears to allow
them to operate in lower speed applications such as a ship's
propeller. In most large power plants, turbines are connected
directly to generators without reduction gears. Typical speeds are
<font color="#191970">3,600 revolutions per minute </font>(RPM) in
the US at 60 hertz and 3,000 RPM in Europe and other countries with
50 hertz power systems. In nuclear applications, turbines typically
run at half the speed, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. The turbine rotor is
also capable of producing power when rotating in only one direction.
Therefore, a reversing gear or a gearbox is usually required when
power is needed in the opposite direction[reference ].</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Rankine cycle is sometimes
called <font color="#dcdcdc">the practical Carnot cycle</font>,
because when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram starts to
resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition
(in the boiler) and removal (<font color="#2f4f4f">in the condenser)
</font>are isobaric (<font color="#556b2f">constant pressure</font>)
processes in the Rankine cycle and <font color="#6b8e23">isothermal
</font>(constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot
cycle. In this cycle, a pump is used to pressurise the <font color="#228b22">liquid</font>,
not gas, coming from the condenser. Pumping the liquid working fluid
during the cycle requires only a small fraction of the energy needed
to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working
fluid <font color="#191970">in gaseous form </font>in a compressor
(as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine
differs from that of a turbine because condensation and
re-evaporation occur in the cylinder or steam inlet passages.</p>

The name derives from the Greek roots ὀξύς oxys, 'acid',
literally 'sharp', referring to the acidic taste of acids, and -γενής
-genes, 'producer', literally 'generator', because at the time of its
naming it was mistakenly believed that all acids needed oxygen for
their composition. Oxygen is commonly used in the production chain of
steel, plastics and textiles, in the brazing, welding and cutting of
steel and other metals, as rocket fuel, in oxygen therapy and in life
support systems in aircraft, submarines, space flight and diving,
among other things.</p>

competed for an advantage in the Gulf and used the increased revenues
to finance expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi Arabia's arms

Israel's. Another reason for Saudi Arabia's large-scale arms
purchases from the United States was that <font color="#483d8b">in

Shi'ite-dominated state which, following the 1979 Iranian Revolution,
came under the rule of a theocratic Islamist government led by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an
Arab, predominantly Sunni Muslim state governed by <font color="#bc8f8f">a
quasi-absolutist </font>monarchy. After the Iranian revolution, the
Saudis were forced to deal with the possibility of internal
instability through the radicalisation of Islamism, which was quickly
exposed when Wahhabi extremists seized the Grand Mosque of Mecca <font color="#663399">in

late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia urged the US to attack Iran to
destroy its potential nuclear weapons programme and described Iran as

Commission </font>is the main executive body of the European Union.
Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states that the
Commission must 'promote the general interest of the Union', and
<font color="#dcdcdc">Article 17(3) </font>adds that the members of
the Commission must be 'completely independent' and may not 'take
instructions from any government'. Article 17(2) states that 'unless
otherwise provided in the Treaties, acts of the Union may be adopted
only on a proposal from the Commission'. This means that <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Commission has </font>a monopoly on initiating the legislative
procedure, even though the Council is &quot;the de facto catalyst for
many legislative initiatives&quot;. Parliament can also formally
request the Commission to make a legislative proposal, but the
Commission can reject such a proposal, giving reasons. The <font color="#556b2f">Commission
President </font><font color="#6b8e23">(</font>currently former

</font>sets the agenda for EU action. Decisions are taken by <font color="#191970">simple

procedure', where proposals are circulated and adopted if there are
no objections. Following <font color="#483d8b">Ireland'</font>s

more importantly the portfolios for which they are responsible) are
closely negotiated between Member States. The Commissioners then have
to be approved by qualified majority in the Council and majority in
the Parliament. The proposal that Commissioners should be elected by

TFEU </font>defines the <font color="#dcdcdc">ordinary legislative
procedure for the </font>adoption of new legislation<font color="#dcdcdc">,
which applies to most EU acts</font>. Essentially, there are three
readings, starting with <font color="#2f4f4f">a Commission proposal</font>,
where Parliament must <font color="#556b2f">vote </font><font color="#6b8e23">by
a majority of </font><font color="#556b2f">all MEPs (not just those

committee is </font>convened<font color="#191970">, </font>representing
MEPs, ministers and the Commission, to try to reach agreement on a
joint text. If this is successful, the text is sent back to the
Parliament and the Council for adoption by qualified majority and
without conditions. This means that <font color="#483d8b">legislation

different procedure for budgets. The Council has to authorise
&quot;enhanced cooperation&quot; between at least a subset of member
states. The Commission should inform national governments at the
outset, before proposals enter the legislative procedure. The EU as a
whole can only act within the limits of its competences as laid down
in the Treaties. Articles <font color="#663399">4 and 5 TEU </font>state
that competence remains with the Member States unless it has been
transferred, although there is a debate on the question of
competence-competence: who ultimately has the 'competence' to define
the EU's 'competence'. Many national courts believe they decide,

Today, the <font color="#a0522d">Court of Justice of the European

</font>is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher
Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as the Court of Justice of the
European Communities), which deals with cases of more general
importance, and a General Court, which deals with more detailed
questions of less general importance. There is also the <font color="#191970">Civil
Service Tribunal</font>, which deals with cases involving EU staff,
and a separate Court of Auditors. Under Article 19(2) of the Treaty
on European Union, each Member State has one judge, currently <font color="#8b0000">28,
who </font>has the 'qualifications required for the highest judicial
office' (or, in the case of the General Court, the 'ability required
for the highest judicial office'). The judges elect the president for
a <font color="#483d8b">term of three years</font>. According to
Article 19(3) TEU, the Court of Justice is the supreme court which
interprets questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by
<font color="#3cb371">national courts </font>(English Court of
Appeal, German Bundesgerichtshof, Belgian Cour du travail, etc.), but
they can refer questions to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since its creation, the <font color="#a9a9a9">EU
</font>has been operating in the midst of an increasing number of
national and globalising legal systems. This has meant that both the
<font color="#2f4f4f">European Court of Justice and the highest
national courts </font>have had to develop principles for resolving
conflict of laws issues between different systems. Within the EU, the
Court considers that where <font color="#556b2f">EU law </font>conflicts
with a provision of national law, <font color="#6b8e23">EU law
</font><font color="#a0522d">prevails</font>. In the first major case
in <font color="#228b22">1964</font>, <font color="#191970">Costa v
ENEL</font>, a Milanese lawyer and former shareholder in an energy
company, Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel in protest
at the nationalisation of Italian energy companies. He argued that
the Italian nationalisation law was incompatible with the Treaty of
Rome and sought recourse to both the Italian Constitutional Court and
the <font color="#8b0000">Court of Justice of the European
Communities </font>under Article 267 TFEU. <font color="#483d8b">The
Italian Constitutional Court </font>issued an opinion stating that
<font color="#3cb371">Costa had no claims because </font><font color="#bc8f8f">the
nationalisation law dated back to 1962 and the Treaty was in force
since 1958. </font>On the contrary, the <font color="#663399">Court
</font>held that the Treaty of Rome did not ultimately prevent in any
way the nationalisation of energy and that, in any event, only the
Commission, and not Costa, could have brought an action under the
Treaty provisions. In principle, however, Costa was entitled to rely
on the Treaty's incompatibility with national law and the Court would
be obliged to consider his request for a preliminary ruling if its
decision was not challenged. The Court reiterated its view in Van
Gend en Loos, stating that Member States &quot;have limited their
sovereign rights, albeit in limited areas, and have established a
legal order applicable to both their nationals and themselves&quot;
on the basis of &quot;reciprocity&quot;. EU law &quot;cannot be
superseded by national rules, however formulated.... without calling
into question the Community legal basis&quot;. This meant that a
&quot;subsequent unilateral act&quot; of a Member State could not be
applied. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v. Simmenthal
SpA, a Simmenthal SpA company argued that the public health
inspection charge on imports of beef from France into Italy under the
1970 Italian law was contrary to two decrees of <font color="#008080">1964
and </font>1968. The Court stated that &quot;in accordance with the
principle of the primacy of Community law&quot;, &quot;measures
directly applicable by the institutions&quot; (such as the
regulations in this case) &quot;automatically render inapplicable any
conflicting provisions of existing national law&quot;. This was
necessary in order to prevent a &quot;corresponding prohibition&quot;
of the &quot;unconditional and irrevocable obligations entered into
by the Member States&quot; under the Treaty, which could &quot;jeopardise
the very foundations of the EU&quot;. However, despite the Court's
views, the same analysis has not been accepted by the national courts
of the Member States.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In general, all Member States
recognise that <font color="#a9a9a9">EU law takes </font>precedence
over national law when agreed in the Treaties, but they do not accept
that the Court of Justice <font color="#dcdcdc">has the final say on
</font><font color="#556b2f">fundamental constitutional issues
affecting democracy and human rights</font>. In the UK, it is a
fundamental principle that Parliament, <font color="#6b8e23">as the
sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it
wishes explicitly to legislate against EU law</font>. However, this
would only happen if the people expressly wished to leave the EU. In
R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, it was held
that &quot;whatever limitation on its sovereignty Parliament accepted
when it passed the European Communities Act <font color="#a0522d">1972
</font>was entirely voluntary&quot;, so &quot;it has always been
clear&quot; that the UK courts have a duty &quot;to override any rule
of national law which conflicts with a directly enforceable rule of
Community law&quot;. Recently, the UK Supreme Court held in R (HS2
Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that although
the UK Constitution is uncodified, it may contain common law
principles and Parliament did not &quot;contemplate or approve the
overruling of those principles&quot; when it enacted the European
Communities Act <font color="#228b22">1972</font>. The German
Constitutional Court has held, on the basis of the Solange I and
Solange II judgments, that <font color="#191970">if the EU does not
respect its fundamental constitutional rights and principles </font>(in
particular democracy, <font color="#8b0000">the rule of law and the
principles of the social state), it cannot override German law.</font>
However, as the names on the judgments say, &quot;as long as&quot;
the EU seeks to democratise its institutions and has a framework to
protect fundamental human rights, it would not check the
compatibility of EU law with German constitutional principles. Most
other member states have expressed similar reservations. This
suggests that the legitimacy of the EU rests on the <font color="#483d8b">supreme
authority of the Member States</font><font color="#3cb371">, its
genuine commitment to human rights and the democratic will of its

law </font>concerns the administrative structure of the European

the EU institutions and Member States to respect the law. Both Member
States and the Commission have a general legal right or locus standi
to bring actions against EU institutions and other Member States for
breach of the Treaties. Since the creation of the EU, the Court of
Justice has also held that the Treaties allow citizens or companies
to bring actions against the EU and Member State institutions for
breach of the Treaties and regulations, if they are correctly
interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, in <font color="#2f4f4f">1986
</font>it was held that the Directives did not allow citizens or
companies to bring actions against non-state parties. This meant that
<font color="#556b2f">national courts were </font>not obliged to
apply EU law if a national rule conflicted with it, although a
national government could be sued if it imposed an obligation on
another citizen or company. These rules on direct effect limit the
extent to which national courts are obliged to apply EU law. <font color="#6b8e23">Any

subject to judicial review </font>and judged in accordance with the
principle of proportionality, particularly where general principles

broken, the plaintiff's remedy is often monetary damages, but courts
can also require specific performance or grant injunctions to ensure
that the law is as effective as possible.</p>

Treaties do not &quot;expressly&quot; give citizens or companies the
right to bring actions, they can do so. Historically, international
treaties had only allowed States to bring legal claims for their

quantitative restrictions on trade could be imposed without valid
justification, <font color="#a0522d">Van Gend en Loos </font>could
recover the money it had paid in customs duties. <font color="#228b22">In

288 TFEU, </font><font color="#8b0000">they are &quot;directly
applicable in all Member States</font><font color="#483d8b">&quot;.</font>
Moreover, Member States are obliged not to reproduce the Regulations
in their national legislation in order to avoid confusion. For
example, in Commission v. Italy, the Court of Justice held that Italy
had failed to fulfil its obligation under the Treaties by not
implementing a scheme whereby farmers were paid a premium for the
slaughter of cows (in order to reduce surplus production of dairy
products) and by reproducing the rules in a regulation to which
several additions had been made. &quot;The regulations&quot;, the
Court held, &quot;enter into force only on their publication&quot;
and their implementation could &quot;jeopardise their simultaneous
and uniform application throughout the Union&quot;. On the other
hand, some regulations may themselves expressly require implementing
measures, in which case these specific rules should be respected.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Treaties and regulations have direct
effect (if they are clear, unconditional and immediate), but
<font color="#a9a9a9">directives </font>do not usually give citizens
(as opposed to a Member State) the right to bring actions against
other citizens. In theory, this is because, under Article 288 TFEU,
<font color="#dcdcdc">directives are addressed to Member States and
generally leave &quot;the form and means of implementation to the
national authorities&quot;.</font> This is partly because directives
often set minimum requirements, allowing Member States to apply more
stringent requirements. For example, <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Working Time Directive </font>requires every worker to have at least
<font color="#556b2f">four weeks' </font><font color="#6b8e23">paid
</font><font color="#a0522d">leave per year, </font>but most Member
States require <font color="#228b22">more than </font><font color="#191970">28
days in </font>national legislation. However, the current position of
the Court of Justice is that citizens are entitled to make claims
based on national laws implementing the Directives, but not on the
Directives themselves. Directives do not have what is known as
horizontal direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties). This view
was immediately controversial, and <font color="#483d8b">in the early
1990s </font>three advocates-general argued persuasively that
directives should create rights and obligations for all citizens. The
Court of Justice refused, but there are five major exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Firstly, if the deadline for
transposition of the Directive is not respected, the Member State
<font color="#a9a9a9">cannot implement conflicting laws and </font><font color="#dcdcdc">the
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">citizen can invoke the Directive in such
a case </font><font color="#556b2f">(the so-called &quot;vertical&quot;
direct effect)</font>. Thus, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti, the
Italian government, having failed to transpose <font color="#6b8e23">Directive
73/173/EEC on the packaging and labelling of solvents within the </font>time
limit, could not enforce a contradictory national law of 1963 against
the solvent and varnish company Ratti. A Member State could not
&quot;plead against individuals that it had not itself fulfilled the
obligations arising from the Directive&quot;. Secondly, <font color="#a0522d">a
citizen or company can rely on </font><font color="#228b22">the
Directive</font><font color="#a0522d">, not only in a dispute with a
public authority, but also in a dispute with another citizen or
company.</font> In CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel, the Court
held that a company called CIA Security could defend itself against
competitors' claims that it had failed to comply with the 1991
Belgian decree on alarm systems on the ground that it had not
notified the Commission as required by the directive. Thirdly, if the
Directive expresses a &quot;general principle&quot; of EU law, it <font color="#191970">can
be invoked between private, non-state parties before the deadline for
its implementation.</font> This follows from the case of Kücükdeveci
v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG, where § 622 of the German Civil Code
stated that years of employment under the age of 25 do not count
towards the statutory notice period. Mr Kücükdeveci worked for
Swedex <font color="#483d8b">GmbH &amp; Co KG for </font><font color="#8b0000">10
years</font>, between the ages of 18 and 28, before being dismissed.
He claimed that the law not counting the number of years he had
completed under the age of 25 was unlawful age discrimination under
the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court held that he
could rely on the Directive because equality was also a general
principle of EU law. Thirdly, if the defendant is subject to the
State, albeit not central government, it may still be bound by the
Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc, the Court held that Foster
was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her
employer, <font color="#3cb371">British Gas plc, which </font>forced
<font color="#bc8f8f">women to retire at 60 and men at 65, </font>if
(1) it was a state measure, (2) it provided a public service and (3)
it had special powers. This can also apply if the company is
privatised, as was the case with the water company, which was
responsible for basic water maintenance.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Fourth, <font color="#a9a9a9">national
courts are </font>obliged to interpret national legislation &quot;as
far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the
Directive&quot;. In textbooks (though not in the courts themselves)
this is often referred to as &quot;indirect effect&quot;. In
Marleasing SA v. La Comercial SA, the Court of Justice held that the
Spanish court had to interpret the general provisions of the Civil
Code relating to contracts without cause or which defraud creditors
as being in conformity with Article 11 of the First Company Law
Directive, which required that <font color="#dcdcdc">incorporation
could only be annulled for a specific list of reasons</font>. The
Court was quick to acknowledge <font color="#2f4f4f">that </font>the<font color="#2f4f4f">
obligation of interpretation could not be in conflict with the
wording of the national law.</font> Fifth, if a Member State has not
implemented the Directive, a citizen may not be able to bring an
action against the non-state parties, but may be able to sue the
Member State itself for failure to implement the law. In Francovich v
Italy, the Italian government <font color="#556b2f">had not set up </font><font color="#6b8e23">an
insurance fund from which employees could claim unpaid wages if their
employer had become insolvent, </font><font color="#a0522d">as
required by the Insolvency Directive</font>. Mr Francovich, a former
employee of a bankrupt Venetian company, was therefore entitled to
claim from the Italian government <font color="#228b22">ITL 6 million
</font>as compensation for his losses. The Court held that if the
Directive conferred identifiable rights on individuals, and if there
was a causal link between the breach of EU law by a Member State and
the claimant's loss, compensation must be paid. The fact that the
conflicting law is an Act of Parliament is not a defence.</p>

means that legislation must be certain, that is to say, it must be

stems from <font color="#228b22">the principles of legal certainty

France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany </font>after

Germany from regaining a </font><font color="#556b2f">dominant

This was the first time that competition law principles were
incorporated into a multilateral regional agreement, and it created a
model for European competition law. In <font color="#483d8b">1957</font>,
competition rules were incorporated into the Treaty of Rome, also
known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic
Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome made the enforcement of
competition law one of the main objectives of the EEC &quot;through
the establishment of a system ensuring that competition in the common
market is not distorted&quot;. The two main provisions of EU
competition law applicable to undertakings are Article 85, which
prohibits anti-competitive agreements with certain exceptions, and
Article 86, which prohibits abuses of dominant market positions. The
Treaty also laid down the principles governing the competition laws
of the Member States, with Articles 90 for public undertakings and 92
for state aid. The Treaty did not include provisions on mergers
because Member States could not agree at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">The concept of
a social market economy </font>was only introduced into EU law in
<font color="#dcdcdc">2007</font>, but <font color="#2f4f4f">free
movement and trade have been at </font>the heart of European
development <font color="#556b2f">since the Treaty of Rome (</font><font color="#6b8e23">1957)</font>.
According to the well-established theory of comparative advantage,
two countries can both benefit from trade, even if the other
country's economy is less productive in all respects. As in other
regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade
Association or the World Trade Organisation, the removal of trade
barriers and the promotion of the free movement of goods, services,
labour and capital are aimed at <font color="#a0522d">lowering
</font><font color="#228b22">consumer prices. It </font>was
originally theorised that a free trade area <font color="#8b0000">tended
to move towards a customs union </font>leading to a common market,
then a monetary union, then a monetary and fiscal union, then a
political union and finally a full-fledged federal union. In Europe,
however, these stages were remarkably confused, and it is still
unclear whether the 'end game' should be the same as the state as
traditionally understood. In practice, free trade without standards
to ensure fair trade can benefit some people and groups within
countries (especially large corporations) much more than others, but
burden people without bargaining power in expanding markets,
especially workers, consumers, small businesses, emerging industries
and communities. Articles 28-37 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union (TFEU) establish the principle of free movement of
goods within the EU, while Articles 45-66 require the free movement
of persons, services and capital. These so-called &quot;four
freedoms&quot; were considered to be hampered by physical barriers
(e.g. customs duties), technical barriers (e.g. different laws on
safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers
(e.g. different VAT rates). The tension in the law is that free
movement and trade should not lead to an unrestricted commercial
profit motive. The Treaties limit <font color="#483d8b">free trade in
</font>order to give priority to other values such as public health,
consumer protection, workers' rights, fair competition and
environmental improvement. The <font color="#3cb371">Court of Justice
</font>has increasingly held that the specific objectives of free
trade are underpinned by the general objectives of the Treaty to
improve human welfare.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The free movement of goods in the
European Union is achieved <font color="#dcdcdc">through a </font><font color="#a9a9a9">customs
union </font><font color="#dcdcdc">and the principle of
non-discrimination</font>. The EU manages <font color="#2f4f4f">imports
</font>from third countries, <font color="#556b2f">customs duties
</font>between Member States are banned and imports move freely. In
addition, Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union states that &quot;quantitative restrictions on imports and all
measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member
States&quot;. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville, the Court held that
this rule meant that any &quot;trading rule&quot; &quot;adopted by
the Member States&quot; which may &quot;directly or indirectly,
actually or potentially&quot; affect trade falls within the scope of
Article 34. This meant that the Belgian law requiring imports of
Scotch whisky to be accompanied by a certificate of origin was
unlikely to be lawful. It discriminates against <font color="#6b8e23">parallel
importers </font><font color="#a0522d">such as Dassonville</font>,
who cannot obtain certificates from the French authorities from whom
they buy Scotch whisky. This &quot;broad test&quot; for determining
what might constitute an unlawful restraint of trade applies equally
to the actions of bodies such as government departments, such as the
former Buy Irish, which had government appointees. It also means that
governments can be liable for <font color="#228b22">private actors</font>.
For example, in <font color="#191970">Commission v France, </font><font color="#8b0000">French
</font>farmers constantly sabotaged import shipments of Spanish
strawberries and even Belgian tomatoes. France was responsible for
these barriers to trade because the authorities &quot;manifestly and
continuously refrained&quot; from preventing the sabotage. In
general, if the laws or practices of a Member State directly
discriminate against imports (or exports under Article 35 TFEU), they
must be justified under Article 36. Justifications include public
morality, public policy or public security, &quot;the protection of
health and life of humans, animals or plants&quot;, &quot;national
treasures&quot; of &quot;artistic, historic or archaeological value&quot;
and &quot;industrial and commercial property&quot;.&quot; In
addition, environmental protection, although not explicitly listed,
can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement
derived from Article 11 TFEU. More generally, it is increasingly
recognised that fundamental human rights should take precedence over
all trade rules. Thus, in Schmidberger v. Austria, the Court held
that Austria did not infringe Article 34 by not prohibiting <font color="#483d8b">a
demonstration that </font><font color="#3cb371">prevented heavy
traffic from </font>crossing the A13 Brenner motorway on its way to
Italy. Although many businesses, including Schmidberger's German
company, were prevented from trading, the Court held that freedom of
association is one of the &quot;fundamental pillars of a democratic
society&quot; against which the free movement of goods had to be
balanced, and that it was likely to be of secondary importance. If a
Member State invokes the Article 36 ground, the measures it takes
must be proportionate. This means that the rule must pursue a
legitimate aim and be (1) appropriate to achieve that aim, (2)
necessary to prevent a less restrictive measure from achieving the
same result, and (3) proportionate in balancing the benefits of free
trade with those of Article 36.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Often the rules apply neutrally to
all goods, but they can have a greater practical impact on imports
than on domestic products. For such &quot;indirectly&quot;
discriminatory (or &quot;ambiguously applicable&quot;) measures, the
Court has developed further justifications: either those set out in
Article 36 or other &quot;mandatory&quot; or &quot;imperative&quot;
requirements, such as consumer protection, improvement of labour
standards, environmental protection, diversity of the press, fair
trading and others: the categories are not closed. Most famously, in
Rewe-Zentral AG v. Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of
Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs
(not just imported ones) to have an alcohol content of at least <font color="#a9a9a9">25%
</font>was contrary to Article 34 TFEU because it had a greater
negative impact on imports. German liqueurs had an alcohol content of
over 25%, but the Cassis de Dijon that Rewe-Zentrale AG wanted to
import <font color="#2f4f4f">from France </font>contained only 15-20%
alcohol. <font color="#556b2f">The Court </font>rejected the German
government's arguments that the measure would protect public health
under Article 36 TFEU because stronger drinks were available and
sufficient labelling would be sufficient for consumers to understand
what they were buying. This rule primarily concerns requirements
relating to the content or packaging of the product. In Walter Rau
Lebensmittelwerke v. De Smedt PVBA, the Court held that the Belgian
law requiring all margarines to be packaged in cubes infringed
Article 34 and could not be justified by the objective of consumer
protection. The argument that Belgians would believe that it was
butter if it was not in the shape of a cube was disproportionate: it
would &quot;go far beyond the requirements of the objective&quot; and
the labelling would protect consumers &quot;equally effectively&quot;.
In the <font color="#6b8e23">2003 </font>case Commission v Italy,
Italian legislation required that cocoa products containing other
vegetable fats could not be labelled as &quot;chocolate&quot;. It had
to be a &quot;chocolate substitute&quot;. All Italian chocolate was
made exclusively <font color="#a0522d">from cocoa butter</font>, but
British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats.
They argued that the law violated Article 34. The Court ruled that
the low vegetable fat content did<font color="#228b22"> not justify
the labelling &quot;chocolate substitute&quot;.</font> This was
degrading to consumers. A &quot;neutral and objective statement&quot;
was sufficient to protect consumers. If Member States impose
significant barriers to the use of the product, this may also
infringe Article 34. Thus, in 2009, in Commission v Italy, the Court
of Justice held that an Italian law banning <font color="#191970">motorcycles
or mopeds towing trailers </font>infringed Article 34. Again, the law
was applied neutrally to all, but disproportionately affected
importers because Italian companies did not manufacture trailers. It
was not a product requirement, but the Court held that the ban would
prevent people from buying it: it would have a &quot;significant
effect on consumer behaviour&quot; which &quot;affects the market
access of the product concerned&quot;. It would require a
justification or mandatory requirement under Article 36.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In contrast to product requirements
or other laws that impede market access, the Court of Justice has
developed a presumption that &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">selling
arrangements</font>&quot; are presumed not to fall within the scope
of Article 34 TFEU if they apply equally to all sellers and if they
affect them in fact in the same way. In <font color="#dcdcdc">Keck
and Mithouard, </font>two importers argued that an action under
French competition law preventing them from selling Picon beer at
wholesale prices was unlawful. The purpose of the law <font color="#2f4f4f">was
to </font><font color="#556b2f">prevent </font><font color="#6b8e23">competition
in the cucumber sector</font><font color="#2f4f4f">, not to prevent
trade</font>. The Court held that since it was a &quot;de jure and de
facto&quot; equally applicable &quot;selling arrangement&quot; (which
did not change the content of the product), it did not fall within
the scope of Article 34 and therefore did not need to be justified.
Sales arrangements can be considered to have a &quot;de facto&quot;
unequal effect, in particular where traders from another Member State
enter the market but advertising and marketing are restricted. In
<font color="#a0522d">Konsumentombudsmannen v. De Agostini, the Court
</font>examined Swedish bans on advertising to children under 12 and
misleading advertising for skincare products. Although the bans
remained in force (justifiable under Article 36 or as a mandatory
requirement), the Court stressed that total marketing bans may be
disproportionate if advertising is &quot;the only effective means of
promotion by which [a trader] can penetrate the market&quot;. In
Konsumentombudsmannen v. Gourmet AB, the Court suggested that a total
ban on advertising of alcohol on radio, television and in the press
could fall within the scope of Article 34 if advertising is the only
means for sellers to persuade consumers to buy their products through
&quot;traditional social practices and local customs and habits&quot;,
but that national courts would again decide whether the ban was
justified under Article 36 for the protection of public health. Under
the <font color="#228b22">Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the
</font>EU has harmonised restrictions on marketing and advertising to
prohibit conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is
misleading or aggressive, and lists examples of what is considered
unfair. Increasingly, countries need to mutually recognise each
other's regulatory standards and the EU has sought to harmonise
minimum ideals of best practice. Improving standards aims to avoid a
regulatory &quot;race to the bottom&quot; and to give consumers
access to goods from all over the continent.</p>

inception, </font>the Treaties have sought to <font color="#dcdcdc">enable
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">people to pursue their ambitions in any
country through free movement</font>. Because of the economic nature
of the project, the <font color="#556b2f">European Community
</font>initially focused on the <font color="#6b8e23">free movement
of workers as &quot;factors of production&quot;</font>, but from the
1970s onwards the emphasis shifted towards <font color="#a0522d">the
development of a more &quot;social&quot; Europe. </font>Free movement
was increasingly based on <font color="#228b22">'</font><font color="#191970">citizenship</font><font color="#228b22">'</font>,
whereby <font color="#8b0000">people had rights that enabled them to
engage in economic and social activity, rather than economic activity
being </font>a prerequisite for rights. This means that the
fundamental rights of 'workers' under Article 45 TFEU acted as a
specific expression of the general rights of citizens under Articles
18-21 TFEU. According to the Court of Justice, a &quot;worker&quot;
is anyone who is economically active, including anyone in an
employment relationship, &quot;under the direction of another person&quot;
for &quot;remuneration&quot;. However, one need not be paid for work
in order to be protected as a worker. For example, in <font color="#483d8b">Steymann
v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie, </font>a German man claimed the
right to reside in the Netherlands after volunteering for plumbing
and domestic work in the Bhagwan community, which provided for the
material needs of all regardless of their contribution. The court
ruled that Mr Steymann was <font color="#3cb371">entitled to </font><font color="#bc8f8f">reside
in the country, as long as the </font><font color="#3cb371">work he
did was at least &quot;indirectly compensated&quot;.</font> Worker
status means protection against all forms of discrimination by
governments and employers in access to employment, tax and social
security rights. In contrast, a citizen who is &quot;a national of a
Member State&quot; (Article 20(1) TFEU) has the right to apply for a
job and to vote in local and European elections, but with more
limited rights to social security. In practice, free movement has
become politically controversial, as nationalist political parties
have manipulated fears that migrants will deprive people of jobs and
benefits (paradoxically at the same time). In practice, however, all
available studies show that labour mobility has little impact on the
wages and employment of local workers.</p>

of </font><font color="#a9a9a9">the Free Movement of Workers
Regulation </font>set out the main provisions on equal treatment of
workers. First, Articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers <font color="#2f4f4f">may
take up employment, conclude employment contracts and not be
discriminated against in comparison with nationals of a Member State</font>.
In the well-known case of <font color="#556b2f">Belgian Football
Association v Bosman, </font>Belgian footballer <font color="#6b8e23">Jean-Marc
Bosman </font>demanded that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C.
de Liège to USL Dunkirk when his contract expired, regardless of
whether Dunkirk could afford to pay Liège the normal transfer fees.
The Court of Justice held that &quot;transfer rules constitute an
obstacle to free movement&quot; and were illegal unless they could be
justified on grounds of public interest, but this was unlikely. In
Groener v Minister for Education, the Court accepted that a
requirement to speak <font color="#a0522d">Gaelic </font>as a teacher
at a Dublin planning school could be justified as part of a public
policy to promote the Irish language, but only if the measure was not
disproportionate. By contrast, in Angonese v. Cassa di Risparmio di
Bolzano SpA, a bank in Bolzano, Italy, could not require Angonese to
obtain a bilingual certificate which could only be obtained in
Bolzano. The Court, which applied Article 45 TFEU &quot;horizontally&quot;
directly, considered that there would be little possibility for
persons from other countries to obtain the certificate and that since
&quot;it was impossible to provide evidence of the required language
knowledge in any other way&quot;, the measure was disproportionate.
Secondly, Article 7(2) requires equal treatment in tax matters. In
Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v. Schumacker, the Court held that it was
contrary to Article 45 TFEU to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married
couples and social security deductions) to a man who worked in
Germany but lived in Belgium, while other German residents enjoyed
these benefits. In contrast, in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für
Vorarlberg, the Court rejected Weigel's argument that the
re-registration fee charged when he brought his car to Austria
infringed his right to freedom of movement. Although the tax
&quot;probably had a negative impact on the decision of migrant
workers to exercise their right to free movement&quot;, since it
applied equally to Austrians, it had to be considered justified in
the absence of EU legislation. Thirdly, people must <font color="#228b22">be
treated equally as </font>regards &quot;social advantages&quot;, even
though the Court of Justice has accepted the residence qualifying
periods. In <font color="#191970">Hendrix v Employee </font><font color="#8b0000">Insurance
Institute, the Court </font>held that a Dutch citizen was not
entitled to continue receiving disability benefits after moving to
Belgium because the benefit was &quot;closely linked to the
socio-economic situation in the Netherlands&quot;. In contrast, in
Geven v. Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Court held that a Dutch woman
living in the Netherlands who worked in Germany for <font color="#3cb371">3-14
hours a week was </font>not entitled to German child benefit, even
though the wife of a man working full-time in Germany but living in
Austria was. The general grounds for restricting freedom of movement
in Article 45(3) TFEU are &quot;<font color="#bc8f8f">public policy,
public security or public health&quot; and there is also a general
exception in Article 45(4) for &quot;employment in the public
service</font>&quot;.</p>

from Stuttgart, who had set up an office in Milan and had been
reprimanded by the Milan Bar for not being registered, was entitled
to bring an action on the basis of the freedom of establishment and
not the freedom to provide services. However, requirements that a
lawyer must be registered in Milan before he can practise his
profession would be permissible if they were <font color="#6b8e23">not

the government of a Member State and a private entity </font>may
impede the freedom of establishment, so that Article 49 has both a
&quot;vertical&quot; and a &quot;horizontal&quot; direct effect. In

States may not infringe the freedom of establishment of others in the

not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court held that the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 2006, a spill of toxic waste from
a European ship off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire prompted the
Commission to review the legislation on <font color="#dcdcdc">toxic
waste</font>. Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said that &quot;such
highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union&quot;.
As countries like Spain do not even have a criminal offence against
<font color="#2f4f4f">the transport of toxic waste</font>, Justice,
Freedom and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini joined Dimas in
proposing <font color="#556b2f">criminal sanctions </font>for
<font color="#556b2f">&quot;ecological crimes&quot;</font>. The
Union's competence was challenged <font color="#6b8e23">before the
European Court of Justice in 2005 and the </font>Commission won the
case. The judgment set a precedent that the Commission can adopt
supranational criminal legislation, which has never been done before.
So far, the only other proposal has been a draft directive on
intellectual property rights. Proposals against this legislation were
tabled in the European Parliament on the grounds that criminal law
should not be an EU competence, but were rejected in the vote.
However, <font color="#a0522d">in October 2007 the Court of Justice
</font>ruled that the Commission cannot propose criminal sanctions,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The &quot;freedom to provide
services&quot; under Article 56 TFEU <font color="#a9a9a9">applies </font><font color="#dcdcdc">to
persons who provide services &quot;for remuneration&quot;</font><font color="#2f4f4f">,
in particular commercial or professional activities</font>. For
example, in Van Binsbergen v. Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor
de Metaalnijverheid, a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium when advising a
client on a social security matter and was told that <font color="#556b2f">he
could not continue </font><font color="#6b8e23">because </font><font color="#a0522d">under
Dutch law only persons established in the Netherlands could give
legal advice</font>. The Court held that the freedom to provide
services was valid, had direct effect and that the rule was probably
unjustified: maintaining an address in a Member State would be
sufficient to achieve the legitimate aim of good administration of
justice. The Court of Justice has held that <font color="#228b22">secondary
education </font>does not fall within the scope of Article 56 because
it is generally financed by the State, whereas higher education is
not. Health care is generally considered to be a service. In
Geraets-Smits v. Stichting Ziekenfonds, Geraets-Smits claimed that
the Dutch social insurance system should reimburse the costs of the
treatment he received in Germany. The Dutch health authorities
considered the <font color="#8b0000">treatment to </font>be
unnecessary, so he claimed that this restricted the freedom to
provide services (of the German health clinic). Several governments
argued that <font color="#483d8b">hospital services should not be
considered economic </font>and should not be covered by Article 56<font color="#483d8b">.</font>
However, the Court held that health care was a &quot;service&quot;
even if the government (and not the recipient of the service) paid
for the service. National authorities may justifiably refuse to
reimburse patients for medical services provided abroad if the
medical treatment received at home was provided without undue delay
and was in accordance with &quot;international medical science&quot;
as to which treatments are considered usual and necessary. The Court
requires that the patient's individual circumstances justify the
justification of waiting lists, and this is also true in the context
of the UK National Health Service. In addition to public services,
another sensitive area of services is those classified as illegal.
Josemans v. Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Dutch
regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibition in some
municipalities of tourists (but not Dutch citizens) from entering
cafés, does not fall within the scope of Article 56. The Court
reasoned that <font color="#3cb371">drugs </font>were controlled in
all Member States, so this was different from other cases where
prostitution or other ostensibly legal activities were restricted. If
the activity falls within the scope of Article 56, the restriction
can be justified by Article 52 or by the overriding requirements
developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v.
Minister van Financiën, a company selling commodity futures
(together with Merrill Lynch and other bankers) sought to challenge a
Dutch law prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court held that the
Dutch ban was legitimately aimed at preventing &quot;undesirable
developments in securities trading&quot; and protecting consumers
from aggressive sales tactics, thereby maintaining confidence in the
Dutch market. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v. Bonn, the City Council of
Bonn banned the operation of a laserdrome company. It had bought
counterfeit laser guns from a British company called Pulsar Ltd, but
residents had protested against the &quot;killing spree&quot;. The
Court ruled that the value of human dignity in the German
constitution, which was the basis for the ban, was a justified
restriction on the freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de
Futebol v. Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa, the Court also held
that the state monopoly on gambling and the penalty imposed on a
Gibraltar company selling internet gambling services were justified
in order to prevent fraud and gambling at a time when people's
opinions were very different. The ban was proportionate because it
was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle serious fraud problems
on the internet. Article 16 of the Services Directive codified a
number of arguments developed by case law.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As regards companies, the <font color="#a9a9a9">Court
of Justice </font>held in R (<font color="#dcdcdc">Daily Mail </font>and
General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that Member States may restrict the
transfer of a company's seat without infringing Article 49 TFEU. This
meant that the <font color="#6b8e23">parent company of the </font><font color="#556b2f">Daily
Mail </font><font color="#6b8e23">newspaper </font>could not avoid
tax by transferring its seat to the Netherlands without first paying
its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action as
the <font color="#a0522d">rules on the residence of companies had not
yet been harmonised.</font> In Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og
Selkabssyrelsen, on the other hand, the Court found that a British
limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply
with the Danish minimum capital rules. The UK legislation required
only <font color="#228b22">£1 </font>capital to set up a company,
whereas the Danish legislature considered that the requirement to set
up a company was <font color="#191970">DKK 200 000 </font>(approximately
EUR 27 000) to protect creditors in the event of the company failing
and becoming insolvent. The Court held that the <font color="#8b0000">Danish
minimum capital law </font>infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of
establishment and could not be justified because a company
established in the United Kingdom could indeed provide services in
Denmark without being established there and because there were less
restrictive means of achieving the objective of protecting creditors.
This approach was criticised as potentially opening up the EU to
unjustified regulatory competition and a race to the bottom in terms
of standards, as in the US where the state of Delaware attracts the
most companies and often claims to have the worst standards of
corporate accountability and, as a result, low corporate taxes.
Similarly, in <font color="#483d8b">Überseering BV v Nordic
Construction GmbH, the Court </font>held that a German court could
not deny a Dutch construction company the right to enforce a contract
in Germany on the ground that it was not validly incorporated in
Germany. Although restrictions on the freedom of establishment could
be justified <font color="#3cb371">by the protection of creditors,
the right of employees to take part in the work or the public
interest in tax collection</font>, the refusal to act went too far:
it was a &quot;direct denial&quot; of the right of establishment. In
Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt, however, the Court reaffirmed
that, since companies are created by law, they are in principle
subject to any rules of incorporation that the State of incorporation
wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could
prevent a company from transferring its central administration to
Italy, even though it was still active and had been established in
Hungary. The Court thus draws a distinction between the right of
establishment of foreign companies (where restrictions must be
justified) and the right of a State to determine the conditions for
companies established in its territory, although it is not entirely
clear why.</p>
