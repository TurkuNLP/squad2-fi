<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The fibre is most often spun into
yarn or thread and made into soft, breathable textiles. The use of
cotton <font color="#a9a9a9">in fabrics is </font>known from
prehistoric times; fragments of cotton cloth dating back to <font color="#dcdcdc">5000
BC have been </font>found in <font color="#2f4f4f">Mexico </font>and
the <font color="#556b2f">Indus Valley </font>civilisation in ancient
India (present-day Pakistan and some parts of India). Although cotton
has been cultivated since ancient times, its widespread use led to
the invention of the <font color="#6b8e23">cotton mill</font>, which
lowered the cost of <font color="#6b8e23">cotton </font>production,
and it is now the most widely used natural fibre for clothing.</p>

</font>where cotton yarns have been found preserved in copper beads;
these finds date to the <font color="#dcdcdc">Neolithic period

the Indus Valley civilisation, which covered parts of present-day
eastern Pakistan and north-western India between <font color="#2f4f4f">3300

the </font>Frenchman <font color="#2f4f4f">M. Jumel </font>suggested
to the then ruler <font color="#556b2f">Mohamed Ali Pasha that </font>he
could earn a substantial income by growing a special long-staple Maho
cotton (Barbadence) in Lower Egypt for the French market. <font color="#6b8e23">Mohamed
Ali Pasha </font>accepted the proposal and granted himself a monopoly
on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; he later decreed that
cotton should be grown instead of other crops. By the time of the
American Civil War, annual exports had reached $16 million (120 000
bales), rising to <font color="#a0522d">$56 million </font>by 1864,
mainly due to the disappearance of Confederate supply from world
markets. Exports continued to grow even after the re-production of US
cotton, which now employed hired labour, and Egyptian exports reached

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late Middle Ages, cotton
became known in northern Europe <font color="#a9a9a9">as an imported
fibre</font>, and the origin of cotton was known only as a plant.
Since <font color="#dcdcdc">Herodotus </font>had written in his
Histories, Histories, Book III, 106, that trees grew naturally in
India and produced wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree and
not a bush. This aspect is preserved in the name for cotton in
several Germanic languages, such as the Germanic name Baumwolle,
meaning 'cotton' (Baum meaning 'tree', Wolle meaning 'wool'). Since
cotton <font color="#2f4f4f">resembled wool</font>, the inhabitants
of the region could only imagine that cotton was produced by sheep
grown on the plant. <font color="#556b2f">John Mandeville</font>,
writing in 1350, took this now absurd belief as fact: 'There [in
India] grew a wonderful tree which bore little lambs on the ends of
its branches. These branches were so flexible that they bent
downwards to allow the lambs to eat when they were hungry [sic]' (See
Tartarian plant shovels.) <font color="#6b8e23">By the end of the

the UK and the US when the American <font color="#dcdcdc">Eli Whitney
</font>invented <font color="#a9a9a9">the cotton gin in </font>1793.
Before the development of ginning machines, cotton fibres had to be
pulled from the gins by <font color="#2f4f4f">hand with </font>great
difficulty. By the late 1700s, several simple ginning machines had
already been developed. However, producing a single bale of cotton
required more than 600 hours of human labour, making large-scale
production uneconomic in the United States, even when people were
used as slave labour. The ginning machine made by Whitney (the Holmes
model) reduced man-hours to only about ten hours per bale. Although
Whitney patented his own cotton gin, he manufactured an earlier
design by Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes applied for a patent
in 1796. Technological developments and increasing control of world
markets enabled British merchants to develop <font color="#556b2f">a
commercial chain whereby </font>raw cotton fibres were bought
(initially) from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in
Lancashire mills and then exported by British ships to captive

and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the <font color="#a9a9a9">American
Civil War, </font>American cotton exports plummeted because of the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Union blockade of </font>Southern ports and the
strategic decision by the Confederate government to reduce exports in
the hope of forcing Britain to recognize the Confederacy or join the
war. This prompted the main buyers of cotton, Britain and France, to
turn to <font color="#2f4f4f">Egyptian </font>cotton. British and
French merchants invested heavily in cotton plantations. Viceroy
Isma'il's Egyptian government took out substantial loans from
European bankers and stock exchanges. After the end of the American
Civil War in 1865, British and French merchants abandoned Egyptian
cotton and returned to <font color="#556b2f">cheap </font>American

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Successful cultivation of cotton
requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine and moderate
rainfall, usually between <font color="#a9a9a9">600 and 1 200 mm </font>(24
to 47 inches). The soil must generally be fairly <font color="#dcdcdc">heavy</font>,
although the nutrient content need not be exceptionally high. These
conditions are generally met in the seasonally dry tropical and
subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, but
much of the cotton grown today is grown in areas with less rainfall
and irrigated access to water. Production of a given year's crop
usually begins shortly after the previous autumn's harvest. Cotton is
a naturally perennial crop, but is grown as an annual <font color="#2f4f4f">to
control pests.</font> In the northern hemisphere, the planting period
in spring varies from early February to early June. The <font color="#556b2f">South
Plains </font>region of the United States is the largest continuous
cotton-growing area in the world. Although cotton is successfully
grown on dry land (without irrigation) in this region, a steady crop
can only be obtained by relying heavily on irrigation water from the
Ogallala aquifer. Cotton's tolerance to some <font color="#6b8e23">salt
and drought makes it </font>an attractive crop in arid and semi-arid
areas. As water resources become scarcer around the world, economies
that rely on water resources face difficulties and conflicts, as well
as potential environmental problems. For example, inappropriate
cultivation and irrigation practices have led to desertification in
areas of Uzbekistan where cotton is a major export. During the Soviet
era, the Aral Sea was used for agricultural irrigation, mainly for
cotton, and now salinisation is common.</p>

against many cotton pests, such as plant insects, stink flies and

desirable. A <font color="#a9a9a9">2006 </font>study of Bt cotton in
China by Cornell researchers, the China Agricultural Policy Center
and the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that after seven years
these secondary pests, which are usually controlled with pesticides,
had increased, requiring the same level of pesticide use as without
Bt cotton and lower profits for farmers due to the additional costs
of GM seeds. However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of

They found that GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. Secondary
pests were mostly insects of the miridae family (plant pests), whose
reproduction was linked to local <font color="#dcdcdc">temperature

studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use to control these
secondary insects was much less than the overall decrease in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The era of industrially produced

</font>France <font color="#dcdcdc">in the 1890s</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Rayon
</font>is derived from natural cellulose and cannot be considered
synthetic, but it requires extensive processing in the manufacturing
process and led to cheaper substitutes for more natural materials. In
the following decades, the <font color="#556b2f">chemical industry
</font>introduced several new synthetic fibres. The fibrous acetate
was developed in 1924, <font color="#a0522d">DuPont </font>introduced
<font color="#6b8e23">nylon for </font>sewing thread in 1936, the
first fibre synthesised entirely from petrochemical raw materials,
and DuPont acrylic was launched in 1944. Fabrics based on these
fibres were used to make some clothing, such as women's stockings
made from nylon, but the cotton market was only threatened when
polyester entered the fibre market in the early 1950s. The rapid
expansion of polyester clothing in the 1960s caused economic
difficulties for cotton-exporting economies, particularly in Central
American countries such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had
increased tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the introduction of
cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s,
but collapsed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.</p>

a consortium of public researchers started sequencing the public
genome of cotton. They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of
cultivated <font color="#dcdcdc">tetraploid cotton</font>.
&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">Tetraploid </font>means that there are
two separate genomes, called A and D genomes, in the nucleus of
cultivated cotton. The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence
the D genome of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a Central American
wild cotton species) because it is small and contains few repetitive
elements. Its base number is almost a third of that of tetraploid
cotton (AD), and each chromosome occurs only once. The A genome of G.
arboreum would be sequenced next. Its genome is about twice as large
as that of G. raimondii. Part of the difference in size between the
two genomes is due to retrotransposon duplication (GORGE). Once the
genomes of the two <font color="#556b2f">diploids </font>have been
assembled, the sequencing of the actual genomes of the cultivated
cotton varieties could begin. This strategy is essential; if the
tetraploid genome were sequenced without the diploid genome template,
the AD genomes would cluster together in their echromatic DNA
sequences and the AD genomes' repetitive elements would cluster
independently into A and D sequences. It would then not be possible
to unravel the AD sequence jumble without comparing them <font color="#6b8e23">to
their diploid counterparts.</font></p>

gradually became a regular and increasingly bold poser. Both
feminists and many cultural conservatives considered the images
pornographic and misogynistic. Lamb expressed some regret that she
had adopted this feature, but denied that it was sexist. The
<font color="#556b2f">Conservative council in Sowerby Bridge,

not belong to a &quot;high-risk group&quot; such as homosexuals<font color="#556b2f">
and recreational drug users.</font> The Sun also published an
editorial claiming that &quot;at last the truth can be told... the
risk of contracting AIDS if you are heterosexual is 'statistically
invisible'. In other words, impossible. So now we know - everything
else is homosexual propaganda.&quot; While many other British press

Al-Qaeda had threatened a terrorist attack on <font color="#a9a9a9">Granada

Operation Elveden after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) revised
its guidelines in April 2015 to <font color="#dcdcdc">prosecute only
journalists who had made payments to police authorities over a period
of time</font>. As a result of the CPS policy change, charges had
been dropped against a number of journalists who had made payments to
other types of public officials, including civil servants, health
care workers and prison staff. In July 2015, Private Eye reported
that The Sun's parent company had refused to pay prosecution costs
relating to the French trial at an expenses hearing in the Old Bailey
case, leading the presiding judge to express &quot;considerable
disappointment&quot; at the situation. Judge <font color="#2f4f4f">Timothy
Pontius </font>told the court that France's illegal actions had been
part of &quot;the clearly acknowledged conduct of The Sun&quot;,
adding that &quot;there is no doubt that <font color="#556b2f">News
International </font>bears some degree of moral responsibility, if
not legal culpability, for the defendant's actions&quot;. The Private
Eye report stated that despite this, The Sun's parent organisation
was &quot;considering disciplinary action&quot; against France, and
at the same time was also preparing to bring a case before the Court
of Inquiry against the <font color="#6b8e23">London Metropolitan
Police Service for </font>taking action against France and two other

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many pesticides can be grouped into
chemical families. The most important families of insecticides are
organochlorines, organophosphates and carbamates. Organic
hydrochlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g. DDT) can be subdivided into
dichlorodiphenyl ethers, cyclodiene compounds and other related
compounds. They act by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the
nerve fibre, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their
toxicity varies widely, but they have been phased out <font color="#dcdcdc">because
of their persistence and bioaccumulation potential</font>:239-240
Organic phosphates and carbamates have largely replaced
<font color="#2f4f4f">organochlorine compounds. </font><font color="#556b2f">Both
act by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing
acetylcholine to transmit nerve impulses indefinitely </font>and
cause a variety of symptoms such as <font color="#6b8e23">weakness or
paralysis.</font> Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and
have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates:136-137
Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates.
Well-known herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides
(e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g. atrazine), ureas (e.g. diuron) and
chloroethane silides (e.g. alachlor). <font color="#a0522d">Phenoxy
compounds </font>tend to selectively kill <font color="#228b22">broadleaf
weeds </font>rather than grasses. Phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides
act like plant growth hormones, growing cells without normal cell
division <font color="#191970">by breaking down the plant's nutrient
transport system</font>. 300 Triazines interfere with <font color="#8b0000">photosynthesis.</font>
335 Many commonly used pesticides do not belong to these families,
such as glyphosate.</p>

harmful organisms. For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that
can spread potentially fatal diseases such as <font color="#a9a9a9">West
Nile virus, yellow fever and malaria. </font>They can also be used to
kill bees, wasps or <font color="#dcdcdc">ants </font>that can cause
allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from diseases
caused by parasites such as fleas. Pesticides can prevent diseases in
humans that can be caused by mouldy food or diseased products.
Herbicides can be used to remove roadside <font color="#2f4f4f">weeds,
trees and shrubs</font>. They can also be used to kill invasive weeds
that can cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly used in
ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as aquatic weeds,
which can interfere with activities such as <font color="#6b8e23">swimming
and fishing </font>and <font color="#a0522d">make the water look or
smell unpleasant.</font> Uncontrolled pests such as termites and
moulds can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in
grocery stores and food warehouses to control rodents and insects
that contaminate foods such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries
a certain risk. Proper use of pesticides reduces these risks to
levels that are considered acceptable by pesticide regulatory
agencies such as the US <font color="#228b22">Environmental

protect their crops since <font color="#a9a9a9">before 2000 BC. The

used by the ancient Sumerians around 4500 years ago <font color="#dcdcdc">in

years old, the use of poisonous plants for pest control is mentioned.
Towards the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as <font color="#2f4f4f">arsenic,
mercury and lead </font>were applied to crops to kill pests. In the
17th century, <font color="#556b2f">nicotine sulphate</font> was
extracted <font color="#6b8e23">from tobacco leaves </font>to be used
as an insecticide. In the 19th century, two other natural pesticides
were introduced: <font color="#a0522d">pyrethrum, </font>from
<font color="#228b22">chrysanthemums, </font>and rotenone, from the
roots of tropical vegetables. Arsenic-based pesticides were dominant
until the 1950s. <font color="#191970">Paul Müller </font>discovered
that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorine compounds
such as DDT were predominant, but were replaced in the USA by
organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrins have
become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became widespread <font color="#8b0000">in

compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid,

was invaded by Anglo-Saxon peoples</font>. By <font color="#dcdcdc">600
AD </font>they had taken control of much of modern England, but
Somerset was still under native British control. For a while longer
the British continued to block the Saxons' advance south-west, but <font color="#2f4f4f">by
the early eighth century </font><font color="#556b2f">King Ine of
Wessex </font><font color="#2f4f4f">had pushed the boundaries of the
West Saxon empire far enough west that Somerset was part of it. The

several times </font><font color="#a0522d">in the 10th century </font><font color="#6b8e23">to
host Witenagemot.</font> After the Norman Conquest, the county was
divided into 700 counties, and the Crown owned vast areas, with forts
such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence. Somerset is home
to <font color="#228b22">HM Prison Shepton Mallet, the oldest prison
in England, which was still in use before its closure in 2013, having
opened in </font><font color="#191970">1610</font>. In the English
Civil War, Somerset was largely on the side of Parliament, with the
siege of Taunton and the Battle of Langport being key battles. In
1685, the <font color="#8b0000">Monmouth Rebellion was fought in
Somerset and neighbouring Dorset</font>. The rebels landed in Lyme
Regis and travelled north in the hope of capturing Bristol and Bath,
but were defeated at the Battle of Sedgemoor in Westonzoyland, the
last battle fought in England. Arthur Wellesley took the title of
Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington, and in his memory
there is a large, illuminated obelisk on a nearby hill, known as the
Wellington Memorial.</p>

operations such as steam locomotive burning. Burning straw bales
soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of firebombs
dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers, while
firebombs dropped in the right place were quickly suppressed where
possible. Oil drums were also lit to simulate the effect of a burning
city to trick subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs
in the wrong place. The <font color="#a0522d">Chew Magna decoy town

°C </font>(50.0 °F) and seasonal variations in temperature are less

temperatures are usually 1 °C (3 °F) or <font color="#6b8e23">2 °C

inland, reducing the amount of sunshine. <font color="#a0522d">Annual
sunshine is slightly below the regional average of 1 600 hours</font>.
In December 1998, Yeovilton had 20 days without sunshine. Most of the
rainfall in the south-west is due to the Atlantic lowlands or
convection. Most of the autumn and winter rainfall is caused by the
Atlantic depressions, which are the most active at that time. In
summer, much of the rainfall is caused by the sun warming the
surface, leading to convection and showers and thunderstorms. The<font color="#228b22">
average rainfall is around 700 mm. </font><font color="#8b0000">Snow
typically falls on around 8-15 days</font>. On average, the winds are

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The province has a long tradition of
<font color="#a9a9a9">supplying freestone and building stone</font>.
Doulting Quarries supplied the freestone used in the construction of
Wells Cathedral. Bath stone is also widely used. <font color="#dcdcdc">Ralph
Allen promoted its use in the early 1700s, as did Hans Price in the
1800s, </font>but it was used long before that. The stone was
quarried underground at <font color="#556b2f">Combe Down </font>and
Bathampton Down and as a result of the Box Tunnel quarrying at places
like Box in Wiltshire. Bath stone is still used today on a smaller
scale, but more often as a cladding material than as a building
material. Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name for the
stone from Ham Hill, which is also widely used in the building
industry. <font color="#6b8e23">Blue Lias stone has been used locally
as building stone and as a raw material for </font><font color="#a0522d">lime
mortar and Portland cement. </font>Until the 1960s, <font color="#228b22">Puriton
</font>had Blue Lias quarries, as did several other villages in
Polden. Its quarries also supplied the cement works at Dunball, next
to King's Sedgemoor Drain. Its early 20th century derelict remains
were removed when the M5 motorway was built in the mid-1970s. <font color="#8b0000">The
county has been supplying aggregates since the </font>1920s. <font color="#8b0000">Foster
Yeoman is Europe's largest supplier of limestone aggregate</font>,
with quarries at Merehead Quarry<font color="#8b0000">.</font> It has

was linked to Glastonbury Tor when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed
to have found the bones of King Arthur and his queen</font>. Most
certainly, Glastonbury was an important religious centre by the <font color="#dcdcdc">700s</font>,
claiming to be '<font color="#2f4f4f">the world's oldest Christian
church on earth', located in the 'mystical land of Avalon</font>'.
This claim is based on the fact that the monastic community dates
back to <font color="#556b2f">63 AD. The monk monastery is said to
have been founded in 63 63 AD</font>, when Joseph of Arimathea
legendarily visited it and was supposed to have brought the Holy
Grail. Woodspring Priory and Muchelney Abbey were also important
religious sites in the Middle Ages. The present Diocese of Bath and

October 1701. The </font>Act sought to <font color="#2f4f4f">establish

Soon after, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers: Samuel

Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb and Timothy Woodbridge, all of whom had
studied <font color="#556b2f">at Harvard</font>, met in Reverend
Samuel Russell's study in Branford, Connecticut, to compile their
books together to establish a school library. The group led by James

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1718, at the behest of either
Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall,
Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman named Elihu Yale,
who lived in <font color="#a9a9a9">Wales </font>but was born in
<font color="#dcdcdc">Boston </font>and whose father <font color="#2f4f4f">David
</font>had been one of the original settlers of New Haven, and asked
him for financial help to build a new building for the college.
Persuaded by Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in trade
while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company,
donated nine bales of goods which sold for over £560, a considerable
sum at the time. <font color="#556b2f">Cotton Mather </font>proposed
that the school's name be changed to Yale College. At the same time,
a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent
intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The <font color="#6b8e23">500
</font>books sent in 1714 represented the best of modern English
literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound
impact on Yale's intellectual community. The student Jonathan Edwards
discovered the works of John Locke and developed his original
theology, known as the &quot;new divinity&quot;. In 1722, the rector
and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new
ideas, announced that they had renounced Calvinism, become Arminians
and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and
returned to the colonies as missionaries of the Anglican faith.
Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and struggled to return the
college to Calvinist orthodoxy; but he did not close the library.
Other students found Deist books in the library.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Serious American students of
theology and divinity, especially in New England, considered Hebrew,
along with Greek and Latin, to be the classical language necessary
for studying the Old Testament in its original words. The Reverend
Ezra Stiles, Rector of the College from <font color="#a9a9a9">1778 to
1795</font>, brought with him an interest in <font color="#dcdcdc">Hebrew
</font>as a means of studying ancient biblical texts in their

all freshmen to study <font color="#2f4f4f">Hebrew </font>(unlike at
Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the
language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">אורים

greatest challenge came in <font color="#556b2f">July 1779</font>,

destroy the College<font color="#556b2f">, but </font>Yale graduate

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Yale's 1828 report dogmatically
defended the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted
more courses in modern languages, mathematics and science. Unlike
higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for
colleges and universities in the United States. In competing for
students and financial support, higher education leaders struggled to
keep up with the demands for innovation. At the same time, they
realised that a significant proportion of their students and
potential students required a classical background. The Yale Report
meant that <font color="#a9a9a9">classical studies would not be
abandoned.</font> All institutions experimented with curricular
changes, often resulting in dual degrees. In the decentralised
environment of US higher education, balancing change and tradition
was a common challenge, as no one could afford to be either fully
modern or fully classical. A group of Yale professors and New Haven
Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to
the changes brought about by <font color="#dcdcdc">Victorian culture</font>.
They focused on <font color="#2f4f4f">developing a holistic human
being with religious values strong enough to resist temptations </font>from
within but flexible enough to adapt to temptations from without
(professionalism, materialism, individualism and consumer culture).
William Graham Sumner, who served as professor from <font color="#556b2f">1872
to 1909</font>, taught in the emerging disciplines of <font color="#6b8e23">economics
and sociology in </font>crowded classrooms. He defeated President
Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to
stick to its tradition of classical education. Porter objected to
Sumner's use of Herbert Spencer's textbook, which advocated agnostic
materialism, because it could harm students.</p>

Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an <font color="#dcdcdc">artist
</font>whose <font color="#2f4f4f">heroes idealised the battles and
trials of strength in the Wild West</font>. The fictional Yale man of
the turn of the 20th century, Frank Merriwell, embodied the heroic
ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor, <font color="#556b2f">Frank
Stover</font>, in the novel Stover at Yale (1911), challenged the
businessman mentality that had come to dominate the school. Students
increasingly turned to sports stars as their heroes, especially as

the student body, alumni and the team itself.</p>

when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first inter-university
debates, to <font color="#dcdcdc">1909</font>, when Harvard, Yale and
Princeton held their first triangular competition, these early
debates were framed by the rhetoric, symbolism and metaphors used in
athletics. The debates were covered on the <font color="#2f4f4f">front

and team members even received <font color="#6b8e23">letters on their
jackets that corresponded to sports letters</font>. Debate teams were
even sent to matches. However, debating never achieved the same
widespread appeal as athletics. One reason may be that there is no
clear winner in debates, as in sports, and that <font color="#a0522d">scoring
is subjective</font>. In addition, late 19th century concerns about
the effects of modern life on the human body meant that athletics
offered hope that neither the individual nor society was falling
apart.</p>

</font>sparked controversy over Yale's new roles<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, served as president from
<font color="#dcdcdc">1871 to 1886</font>. In an era of massive
expansion in higher education, Porter opposed the rise of <font color="#2f4f4f">a
new research university</font>, arguing that <font color="#6b8e23">enthusiastic
adoption of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education</font>.
Many of Porter's contemporaries criticised his administration, and
historians have since disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues that
Porter was not a <font color="#a0522d">simple reactionary</font><font color="#228b22">,
uncritically committed to tradition, but a </font>principled and
selective conservative. Rather than embracing everything old and
rejecting everything new, he sought to apply long-established ethical
and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have
misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly
anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the birth and
growth of the modern university.</p>

forward for Yale's representation in national elections after the end
of the Vietnam War. Several sources cite the spirit of campus
activism that has prevailed at Yale since the 1960s and the spiritual
influence of the Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many future
candidates. Yale President Richard Levin explains the candidacy as a
result of <font color="#a9a9a9">Yale's focus on creating a
&quot;laboratory for future leaders,&quot; a </font>priority of the
institution that began under Yale presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold
and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale
College and current president of Duke University, said, &quot;We pay
very close attention to community orientation in our selection
processes, and Yale has a <font color="#dcdcdc">very strong tradition
of volunteerism. &quot;</font>Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes that
Yale in the 20th century had an &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">ethos of
organized action</font><font color="#556b2f">&quot; </font>that led
to John Kerry leading the liberal party of the Yale Political
Alliance, George Pataki leading the conservative party and Joseph
Lieberman leading the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia points to the
history of networking and elitism: &quot;It is linked to the network
of friendships and connections built in school.&quot; CNN suggests
that George W. Bush benefited from the privileged admission granted
to <font color="#6b8e23">&quot;the son and grandson of alumni&quot;

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many of Yale's buildings were built
in the Collegiate Gothic architectural style between 1917 and 1931,
and were largely funded by <font color="#a9a9a9">Edward S. Harkness.
</font>The stone sculptures on the walls of the buildings depict
modern college characters, including <font color="#dcdcdc">a writer,
an athlete, a socialite drinking tea and a student falling asleep
while reading</font>. Similarly, the buildings' decorative friezes
depict <font color="#2f4f4f">contemporary scenes</font>, such as
police officers chasing a mugger and arresting a prostitute (on the
wall of the law school) or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and
a cigarette. Architect James Gamble Rogers aged the buildings <font color="#556b2f">by
splashing acid on the walls</font>, <font color="#6b8e23">deliberately
</font><font color="#a0522d">breaking leaded glass windows and
repairing them in medieval style</font>, and creating niches for
decorative statues that were left empty to simulate disappearances or
thefts over time. In fact, the buildings only simulate medieval
architecture, for although they appear to be built of massive stone
blocks in the true style, most of them actually have steel frames,
which were commonly used in the 1930s. One exception is the 66-metre
high Harkness Tower, originally a freestanding stone building. It was
strengthened in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial
Carillon.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Yale's English and Comparative
Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Among
the New Critics, <font color="#a9a9a9">Robert Penn Warren, W.K.
Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks were among the </font>Yale faculty. Later,
the Yale Department of Comparative Literature became the centre of
American deconstruction. <font color="#dcdcdc">Jacques Derrida, </font>the
father of deconstruction, taught <font color="#2f4f4f">in the
Comparative Literature Department from the </font>late 1970s to the
mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members also joined
deconstruction, forming the so-called &quot;Yale School&quot;. They
included Paul de Man, who taught in the Departments of Comparative
Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both in
the Departments of English and Comparative Literature) and Harold
Bloom (Department of English), whose theoretical stance was always
somewhat specific and who ultimately followed a very different path
from the other members of this group. The Yale History Department has
also been at the origin of important intellectual trends. Historians
C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with starting an
important stream of Southern historians in the 1960s and 1970s;
similarly, the labour historian <font color="#556b2f">David
Montgomery </font>advised many of the country's current generation of
labour historians. The Yale School and Department of Music
contributed to the growth of music theory in the second half of the
20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in <font color="#6b8e23">1957</font>;
Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the Charleston, South Carolina
church shooting, Yale came under renewed criticism in the summer of
2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges named after
<font color="#a9a9a9">John C. Calhoun</font>, a <font color="#dcdcdc">slave
owner and strong advocate of slavery in the 19th century</font>. In
July 2015, students signed a petition calling for the name to be
changed. They argued in the petition that while Calhoun was revered
in the 19th century as an &quot;exceptional American statesman&quot;,
he was &quot;one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white
supremacy in US history&quot;. In August 2015, Yale President Peter
Salovey addressed the freshman class of 2019, responding to racial
tensions but explaining why the college would not be renamed. He
described Calhoun as &quot;an eminent political theorist, vice
president of two different US presidents, secretary of war and
secretary of state, and a congressman and senator representing South
Carolina&quot;. He admitted that Calhoun also &quot;believed that the
highest forms of civilization depended on voluntary slavery. Not only
that, but he also believed that the races he considered inferior,
especially the black people, should be subjected to it for their own
interests.&quot; Racial tensions escalated in the fall of 2015,
focusing on comments made by <font color="#2f4f4f">Nicholas A.
Christakis and his wife Erika </font>regarding free speech. In April
2016, Salovey announced that &quot;despite decades of strong alumni
and student protests&quot; Calhoun's name would remain on the Yale
residential college campus, explaining that Yale students would be
better off living in Calhoun's &quot;shadow&quot; so that they would
be &quot;better prepared to meet the challenges of the present and
the future.&quot; He argued that removing Calhoun's name would
<font color="#556b2f">&quot;obscure&quot; his &quot;legacy of slavery
rather than address it&quot;.</font> &quot;Yale is part of that
history&quot; and &quot;We cannot erase American history, but we can
confront it, teach it and learn from it&quot;. One change that will
be given is that the <font color="#6b8e23">title of &quot;Master&quot;
for faculty members who serve as residential college directors will
be renamed &quot;College Director&quot; </font>because of its
connotation of slavery.</p>

in Europe came to a halt around 1300. A series of famines and
plagues, such as the Great Famine of <font color="#a9a9a9">1315-1317
</font>and the Black Death, reduced the population to about half of
what it was before these disasters<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font> With
the decline in population came social unrest and endemic warfare.
<font color="#dcdcdc">France and England </font>experienced serious
peasant revolts, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, and
the <font color="#2f4f4f">Hundred Years' </font>War, which lasted for

eroded the last vestiges of the Byzantine Empire and cut off trade

<font color="#dcdcdc">intellectual, cultural or artistic
</font>developments, but it is not seen as a defining feature of the
whole European historical period. Rather, the period <font color="#2f4f4f">from
the early 1300s to the 1500s - sometimes even up to the 1500s - </font>was
characterised by other trends: demographic and economic decline
followed by recovery, <font color="#556b2f">the end of Western
religious unity </font>and the subsequent emergence of the <font color="#6b8e23">nation
state</font>, and the expansion of European influence in the rest of
the world.</p>

of mercenaries; it was considered the largest army of its time. Using
this powerful tool, the Hungarian king led wars against the Turkish
armies and stopped the Ottomans during his reign. After Matthew's
death and the abolition of the Black Army, the Ottoman Empire was

to consider this period as the end of the Middle Ages and the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The history of the <font color="#a9a9a9">University
of Michigan </font>and Ann Arbor has been closely intertwined since
the university was founded in the city in 1837. The city became a
regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the <font color="#dcdcdc">Michigan
Central Railroad, and </font>in 1878 the North-South Railroad was
established, connecting <font color="#2f4f4f">Ann Arbor to </font><font color="#556b2f">Toledo
</font>and other southern markets. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s,
settlers continued to arrive in Ann Arbor. The earlier settlers were
primarily of <font color="#6b8e23">British </font>descent, but the
newer settlers also included Germans, Irish and African Americans. In
<font color="#a0522d">1851, </font>Ann Arbor was incorporated <font color="#a0522d">as
</font><font color="#228b22">a city, but its </font>population
declined during the depression of 1873. It was not until the early
1880s that Ann Arbor grew strongly again, with new immigrants coming
from Greece, Italy, Russia and Poland. Ann Arbor experienced a boom
in manufacturing, particularly in the milling industry. Ann Arbor's
Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and
its first and oldest synagogue, <font color="#191970">Beth Israel

and 1970s, the </font>city gained a reputation as an important centre
for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a centre of left-wing
activism, and was a hub for the civil rights movement, the
anti-Vietnam <font color="#dcdcdc">War </font>movement and the
student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing
campus group Students for a Democratic Society were held in Ann Arbor
in 1960, and in 1965 the city hosted the first anti-Vietnam<font color="#2f4f4f">
War </font>lecture in the United States. Over the next 15 years, many
counterculture and New Left enterprises emerged in the city,
developing large constituencies. These influences were reflected in
municipal politics in the early and mid-1970s, when three members of
the Human Rights Party (HRP) won seats on the city council with
student votes. HRP representatives fought for anti-discrimination
ordinances, decriminalisation of marijuana possession and rent
regulations, among others, during their time on the council; many of
these are still in force in amended form. Alongside these liberal and
left-wing efforts, a small number of conservative institutions

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The widespread adoption of what is
essentially a single feature, the <font color="#a9a9a9">pointed arch,
</font>brought about the change that distinguishes Gothic from
Romanesque. Technological change made possible a change in style that
broke with the tradition of massive masonry and massive walls pierced
by small openings and replaced it with a style in which light seems
to have won over matter. Its use led to the development of many other
architectural techniques, previously tested in fragmented buildings,
which were then introduced to meet the structural, aesthetic and
ideological needs of the new style. These include the <font color="#dcdcdc">flying
buttresses</font>, spires and <font color="#2f4f4f">lattice windows
</font>typical of Gothic church architecture. Although so strongly
associated with the Gothic style, the pointed arch was first used in
Western architecture in buildings that were otherwise distinctly
Romanesque, such as <font color="#556b2f">Durham Cathedral </font>in
the north of England, Monreale Cathedral and <font color="#6b8e23">Cefalù

internal emphasis on the horizontal line, which can be visually
emphasised as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English
cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an exceptional degree
of stylistic diversity compared to most French, German and Italian
cathedrals. It is not unusual for each part of a building to have
been built in a different century and in a different style, with no
attempt at stylistic uniformity. Unlike French <font color="#dcdcdc">cathedrals</font>,
English cathedrals are widely spread out, with <font color="#dcdcdc">double
transepts being </font>heavily <font color="#dcdcdc">built </font>and
Lady Chapels added later, as in Westminster Abbey. In the western
façade, doors are less prominent than in France, and the entrance to
the parish is usually through a side doorway. The west window is <font color="#2f4f4f">very
large </font>and never has a rose window, which is reserved for the

façade may have two towers as in a French cathedral, or none at all.

topped by huge, regionally typical, open towers. Because of the size
of the towers, the façade between the towers can appear narrow and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Gothic cathedrals of the Iberian
Peninsula are characterised by <font color="#a9a9a9">their spatial
complexity</font>, with many different shaped areas leading to each
other. They are relatively wide, often with <font color="#dcdcdc">very
high arched corridors </font>topped by low domes, giving a similar
open feel to the German Hallenkirche, as in the church of the Batalha
monastery in Portugal. Many cathedrals are completely surrounded by
chapels. Like English cathedrals, each cathedral is often different
in style. This is reflected both in the addition of chapels and in
the use of decorative details from different sources. Both decoration
and form have been influenced by <font color="#2f4f4f">Islamic
architecture </font>and, towards the end of the period, by
Renaissance details, which combine in a distinctive way with Gothic.
The west façade, as in the cathedral of León, typically resembles
<font color="#556b2f">the French west façade, </font>but is wider in
proportion to its height, often with a greater variety of details and
a combination of intricate decoration and wide, smooth surfaces.
Burgos Cathedral has <font color="#6b8e23">German-style </font>towers.
The roof structures often have pierced parapets with relatively few
pinnacles. The roof is often topped by towers and domes of very
different shapes and designs.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Italian Gothic style is
characterised by the <font color="#a9a9a9">use of polychrome
decoration</font>, both externally as a marble veneer on the brick
façade and internally, where arches are often made of alternating
black and white blocks, and where <font color="#dcdcdc">columns can
be painted </font><font color="#2f4f4f">red</font>, walls decorated
with frescoes and apse mosaics. The ground plan is usually regular
and symmetrical, and Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced
columns. The proportions are usually mathematically balanced, based
on the square and the concept of 'armonìa', and, with the exception
of Venice, where <font color="#6b8e23">spectacular arches </font><font color="#556b2f">were
loved, the </font>arches are almost always equilateral. Colours and
mouldings define architectural ensembles rather than fuse them.
Italian cathedral facades are often polychrome, and the lunettes
above the doors may have mosaics. Facades have projecting open
porches and <font color="#a0522d">oculus or round windows </font>rather
than rose <font color="#a0522d">windows</font>, and usually do not
have a tower. There is usually a dome at the top of the junction.
There is also often a freestanding tower and a baptismal font. The
east end usually has a relatively low apse. The windows are not as
large as in northern Europe, and although stained glass is common,
the favourite medium for the interior is the <font color="#228b22">fresco</font>.</p>

Picasso's technique of constructing a sculpture from separate

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Historians have divided the history
of Cubism into phases. According to one system, the first phase of
Cubism, known as <font color="#a9a9a9">Analytical Cubism, </font>invented
retrospectively by <font color="#dcdcdc">Juan Gris</font>, was both a
radical and influential short but highly significant artistic
movement in France between 1910 and 1912. The second phase, <font color="#2f4f4f">Synthetic
Cubism</font>, remained vibrant until around 1919, when the
Surrealist movement gained popularity. The English art historian
Douglas Cooper proposed a second system, describing the three phases
of Cubism in his book The Cubist Epoch. According to Cooper, there
was 'early Cubism' (<font color="#556b2f">1906-1908), </font>when the
movement first developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the
second phase was called 'high Cubism' (<font color="#6b8e23">1909-1914),
when </font>Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent (after 1911);
and finally Cooper referred to 'late Cubism' (<font color="#a0522d">1914-1921),
the </font>last phase of Cubism as a radical avant-garde movement.
Douglas Cooper used these terms restrictively to distinguish between
the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser
extent), which implied a deliberate valorisation.</p>

Kahnweiler's </font>claim, made <font color="#dcdcdc">as early as

Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, and were formed to some
extent in response to the 'Salle 41' cubists, whose methods were too
different from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely
secondary. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore
developed. Broader views of Cubism include artists who later joined
the 'Salle 41' artists, e.g. Francis Picabia; the brothers Jacques
Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, who formed the
core of the Section d'Or (or Puteaux Group) from late 1911; sculptors
Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine, Jacques
Lipchitz and Henri Laurens; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis,
Roger de La Fresnaye, František Kupka, Diego Rivera, Léopold
Survage, Auguste Herbin, André Lhote, Gino Severini (after 1916),
María Blanchard (after 1916) and Georges Valmier (after 1918).
Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were 'undermined
by later interpretations of the works of <font color="#228b22">Picasso,
Braque, Gris and Léger</font>, which emphasise iconographic and
ideological issues rather than representational ones'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, Europeans discovered African, Polynesian, Micronesian and
Native American art. Artists such as <font color="#a9a9a9">Paul

primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and African tribal masks.
They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout
their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in

Its disturbing, expressionistic element is even contrary to the
spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic

because Picasso violently overturned established conventions in it,

considering the Demoiselles as the source of Cubism, where primitive
art clearly had an influence. This familiar explanation 'does not
take sufficient account of the complexity of the flourishing art of
the period just before Picasso's new art of painting'. <font color="#556b2f">Between
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">1905 and 1908</font>, the search for a
conscious new style brought about rapid changes in art in France,
Germany, Holland, Italy and Russia. The Impressionists had adopted <font color="#6b8e23">a
double vision</font>, and both <font color="#a0522d">the Les Nabis
group and the Symbolists </font>(who also admired Cézanne) flattened
the pictorial plane and reduced subjects to simple geometric forms.
Another important influence was the neo-impressionist structure and
subject matter, particularly evident in the works of Georges Seurat
(e.g. Parade de Cirque, Le Chahut and Le Cirque). There were also
similarities in the development of literature and social thought.</p>

Cubism can be found in <font color="#a9a9a9">two particular trends in
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">Cézanne's </font><font color="#a9a9a9">later
work</font>: firstly, his breaking of the painted surface into small
multi-faceted areas of paint, emphasising the multidimensional
perspective provided by binocular vision, and secondly, his interest
in simplifying natural forms into cylinders, spheres and cones.
However, the Cubists went further than <font color="#2f4f4f">Cézanne
in </font>exploring this concept. They presented <font color="#556b2f">all
the surfaces of the objects they were depicting on a single image

study of Cubism began in the </font><font color="#dcdcdc">late </font><font color="#2f4f4f">1920s</font>,

opinions of <font color="#556b2f">Guillaume Apollinaire</font>. It
relied heavily on <font color="#6b8e23">Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's
</font><font color="#a0522d">book Der Weg zum Kubismus </font>(published
in 1920), which focused on the development of Picasso, Braque, Léger
and Gris. The terms 'analytical' and 'synthetic' have been widely
accepted since the mid-1930s. Both terms are historical obsessions
that have emerged only after the facts they describe have been
established. Neither phase was designated as such at the time of the
creation of the corresponding works. &quot;If Kahnweiler considers
Cubism to be Picasso and Braque,&quot; wrote Daniel Robbins, &quot;our
only fault is that we subject the works of other Cubists to the
rigours of that limited definition.&quot;</p>

Kahnweiler to question their right to be called cubists at all.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The term cubism only came into
general use in <font color="#a9a9a9">1911</font>, mainly in
connection with Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>In 1911, <font color="#dcdcdc">the poet and critic </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Guillaume
Apollinaire </font><font color="#dcdcdc">introduced the term on
behalf of a group of artists </font>invited to the Indépendants
exhibition in Brussels. The following year, in preparation for the
Salon de la Section d'Or, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published
Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;, a book in which they sought to dispel the
confusion surrounding the word and defend Cubism (which had caused a
public scandal after the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912
Salon d'Automne in Paris). This work, which clarifies their aims as
artists, was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and remains the
clearest and most accessible. The result, which is not only a
collaboration between the two authors, reflects the debates of the
artistic circles that met at Puteaux and Courbevoie. It reflected the
attitudes of Passy's group of artists, which included <font color="#556b2f">Picabia
and the Duchamp </font><font color="#6b8e23">brothers, </font>for
whom parts of it were read before publication. The concept developed
in Du 'Cubisme' of looking at an object simultaneously from different
points in space and time, i.e. moving around the object so that it
can be photographed from several successive angles fused into a
single image (multiple perspectives, moving perspective, simultaneity
or multiplicity), is a widely recognised technique used by the
Cubists.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There was a clear difference between
the Kahnweiler cubists and the Salon cubists. Before 1914, Picasso,
Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) were supported by a
single Parisian art dealer, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed
them an annual income from the exclusive right to buy their works.
Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of specialists. His support
gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative peace. Picasso
worked in <font color="#a9a9a9">Montmartre </font>until 1912, and
Braque and Gris remained there after the First World War. Léger

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Salon Cubists, on the other
hand, built their reputation mainly through regular participation in
the Salon d'Automne and Salon des Indépendants, both of which were
the largest non-academic salons in Paris. They were inevitably more
aware of public reaction and the need to communicate. Already in 1910
a group began to form, including <font color="#a9a9a9">Metzinger,
Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger</font>. They met regularly at Henri le
Fauconnier's studio near the <font color="#dcdcdc">Boulevard de

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The most extreme forms of Cubism
were not practised by Picasso and Braque, who opposed total
abstraction. Other Cubists, notably František Kupka and the Cubists
classified by Apollinaire as Orphists (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and
Duchamp), instead embraced abstraction by removing the visible
subject entirely. Kupka's two works at the 1912 Salon d'Automne,
<font color="#a9a9a9">Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs and Amorpha
chromatique chaude, </font>were highly abstract (or unrepresentative)
and metaphysical. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia between 1912 and
1914 developed expressive and suggestive abstraction devoted to
complex emotional and sexual themes. From 1912 Delaunay painted a
series of paintings called <font color="#dcdcdc">Simultaneous
Windows</font><font color="#2f4f4f">, </font>followed by a series
called Formes Circulaires, in which he combined flat structures with
bright prismatic shades; based on the optical properties of
juxtaposed colours, his detachment from reality in the depiction of
images was almost complete. In <font color="#556b2f">1913-14, </font><font color="#6b8e23">Léger
</font>produced a series of Contrasts of Forms, which placed equal
emphasis on colour, line and form. His cubism, despite its abstract
features, was linked to themes of mechanisation and modern life.
Apollinaire supported these early developments in abstract cubism in
Les Peintres cubistes (1913), in which he wrote of a new 'pure' art
of painting in which the subject was removed. Despite his use of the
term Orphism, however, these works were so different that they defy
attempts to place them in a single category.</p>

from a <font color="#2f4f4f">shared reflection that the </font>work
itself was an object (like a painting) and that it used material
remnants of the world (as in collage and papier collé in Cubist
Construction and Assemblage). The next logical step for Duchamp was
to present the ordinary object as a work of art in its own right,
representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a <font color="#6b8e23">bicycle
wheel to a kitchen stool </font>and in 1914 he chose <font color="#a0522d">a

the 1911 Salon des Indépendants. The Salon de la Section d'Or, held
in October 1912 at Galerie La Boétie in Paris, was probably the most
important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition to present Cubism to a
wide audience. With <font color="#2f4f4f">over 200 </font>works on

Gris had more than a technical or formal meaning, and the different

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;, Metzinger
and Gleizes explicitly linked the sense of time to the multiple
perspectives and gave symbolic expression to the <font color="#a9a9a9">concept
of &quot;duration&quot; introduced by philosopher </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Henri
Bergson</font>, according to which life is subjectively experienced
as a continuum in which the past flows into the present and the
present merges with the future. <font color="#2f4f4f">The Salon
Cubists </font>used a faceted treatment of solid matter and space and
the effects of multiple perspectives to convey a physical and
psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness and to blur the
distinctions between past, present and future. One of the main
theoretical innovations of <font color="#556b2f">the Salon Cubists,
</font>independently of Picasso and Braque, was the concept of
simultaneity, based more or less on the theories of Henri Poincaré,
Ernst Machi, Charles Henry, Maurice Princet and <font color="#6b8e23">Henri
Bergson</font>. With simultaneity, the <font color="#a0522d">notion
of separate spatial and temporal dimensions </font>was thoroughly
questioned. The linear perspective developed during the Renaissance
was abandoned. The subject was no longer viewed from a particular
perspective at a particular point in time, but was constructed on the
basis of a choice of successive perspectives, as if it were viewed
simultaneously from several angles (and in multiple dimensions) and
the eye could wander freely from one perspective to another.</p>

These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by
Aleksandr Arshipenko in 1912-13, for example in <font color="#6b8e23">Woman

with the support of the dealer <font color="#dcdcdc">Léonce
Rosenberg, </font>Cubism returned as a central issue for artists and
continued as such until the mid-1920s, when its avant-garde status
was challenged by the emergence of geometric abstraction and
surrealism in Paris. Many Cubists, such as Picasso, Braque, Gris,
Léger, Gleizes and Metzinger, developed other styles but returned to
Cubism from time to time, well after 1925. Cubism re-emerged in the
1920s and 1930s in the work of American Stuart Davis and Englishman
Ben Nicholson. In France, however, <font color="#2f4f4f">Cubism went
</font>into decline from around 1925 onwards. <font color="#556b2f">Léonce
Rosenberg's </font>exhibitions included not only the artists who had
been exiled from Kahnweiler, but also other artists such as Laurens,
Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918,
Rosenberg organised a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de
l'Effort Moderne in <font color="#a0522d">Paris.</font> Louis
Vauxcelles tried to claim that Cubism was dead, but these
exhibitions, together with the well-organised Cubist exhibition at
the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and the revival of the Salon de la

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The new rise of Cubism coincided
with the <font color="#dcdcdc">production of a </font>coherent
theoretical literature in 1917-24 by <font color="#a9a9a9">Pierre
Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler</font>, and by
the artists <font color="#dcdcdc">Gris, Léger and Gleizes</font>.
The occasional return to classicism - figurative work either
exclusively or alongside cubist work - experienced by many artists
during this period (known as neo-classicism) has been linked to a
tendency to avoid the realities of war and the cultural dominance of
the classical or Latin French image during and immediately after the
war. Post-1918 Cubism can be <font color="#2f4f4f">seen as part of a
broad ideological shift towards </font><font color="#556b2f">conservatism
in </font>both French society and culture. <font color="#6b8e23">Cubism</font>
itself, however, remained evolutionary, both in the work of
individual artists such as Gris and Metzinger, and of artists as
diverse as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Publicly debated, Cubism
became relatively uniform and open to definition. Its theoretical
purity made it a yardstick against which trends as diverse as realism
or naturalism, dada, surrealism and abstraction could be compared.</p>

architecture that sought a style that did not need to refer to the
past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and
sculpture was applied as part of a 'profound reorientation towards a
changed world'. <font color="#a9a9a9">Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's

to the founders of Puritanism, Amédée Ozenfant and Charles-Édouard
Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier), who exhibited their
paintings together in Paris and published Après le cubisme in 1918.
Le Corbusier's aim was to transfer the characteristics of his own
Cubist style to architecture. Between <font color="#228b22">1918 and
1922, </font>Le Corbusier concentrated on purist theory and painting.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The 1912 Salon d'Automne saw the
presentation of an architectural installation that quickly became
known as the Maison Cubiste, signed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and
André Mare and a number of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes, in
Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;, written during the assembly of the &quot;Maison
Cubiste&quot;, wrote about the autonomous nature of art and stressed
that the decorative should not dominate the spirit of art. For them,
ornamentation was &quot;the opposite of image&quot;. &quot;The true
image&quot;, wrote <font color="#a9a9a9">Metzinger </font>and
Gleizes, &quot;carries the reason for its existence within itself. It
can be transferred from church to drawing room, from museum to
studio. Essentially independent, necessarily perfect, it need not
immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it
gradually towards the imaginary depths where the coordinate light
dwells. It is not compatible with this or that entity; it is
compatible with things in general, with the universe: it is an
organism...&quot;. &quot;Marie's ensembles were accepted as frames
for Cubist works because they gave the paintings and sculptures
independence&quot;, writes Christopher Green, &quot;by creating a
play of contrasts, and therefore involved, in addition to Gleizes and
Metzinger, Marie Laurenc, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond
Duchamp-Villon designed the façade) and Marie's old friends Léger
and Roger La <font color="#dcdcdc">Fresnaye</font>&quot;. La Maison
Cubiste was a <font color="#2f4f4f">fully furnished house with a
</font>staircase, wrought-iron railings, a living room - the Salon
Bourgeois with paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (<font color="#556b2f">Woman
with a Fan</font>), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger - and a bedroom. It
was an example of L'art décoratif, a home where cubist art could be
presented in the comfort and style of modern bourgeois life.
Spectators at the Salon d'Automne walked through a full-scale <font color="#6b8e23">10
by 3 metre </font>plaster model of the ground floor of the
Duchamp-Villon-designed façade. This architectural installation was
subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Chicago
and Boston. In the New York exhibition catalogue, it is included in
the Raymond Duchamp-Villon exhibition under the number 609 and the
title 'Façade architecturale, plaster' (Façade architecturale).</p>

architects expressed the demand for <font color="#a9a9a9">dynamism

inherent tranquillity, so that the end result would evoke in the
viewer a sense of <font color="#dcdcdc">dynamism </font><font color="#2f4f4f">and
expressive </font><font color="#556b2f">plasticity.</font> This
should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms,
by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly
triangular, by carved facades of projecting crystalline units
reminiscent of so-called diamond tiling, or even by cave dwellings
reminiscent of late Gothic architecture. In this way, the entire
surface of the façades, even down to the pediments and lintels, is
carved. The columns and other architectural decorations are given <font color="#6b8e23">a
three-dimensional </font>shape. New window and door shapes, such as
<font color="#a0522d">hexagonal </font>windows, were also created in

political philosophy </font>dates back to <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Spring and Autumn period</font>, especially Confucius <font color="#2f4f4f">in
the 6th century BC. </font><font color="#556b2f">Chinese political
philosophy </font>was developed in response to <font color="#6b8e23">the
social and political disintegration of the country, which </font>was
typical of the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States
period. The main philosophies of the period, Confucianism, Legalism,
<font color="#a0522d">Mohism</font>, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had
<font color="#228b22">a political aspect to </font>their
philosophical schools. Philosophers such as <font color="#191970">Confucius</font>,
Mencius and Mozi focused on political unity and political stability
as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated
hierarchical, merit-based governance based on empathy, loyalty and
interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly
authoritarian regime based on harsh punishments and laws. <font color="#8b0000">Mohism
</font>advocated a communal, decentralised government centred on
austerity and asceticism. <font color="#483d8b">Agrarians </font>advocated
a peasant-centred communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated
proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of
<font color="#3cb371">the Qin dynasty</font>, but was replaced <font color="#bc8f8f">by
state religion in the </font>Han dynasty. Before China's transition
to communism, statism remained the dominant political philosophy in
China until the 20th century.</p>

this boom was <font color="#2f4f4f">The Prince, </font>written by
<font color="#a9a9a9">Niccolò </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Machiavelli
</font>in 1511-12 and <font color="#556b2f">published </font>after

together with <font color="#6b8e23">The </font>Discourses, a rigorous
analysis of the classical period, <font color="#a0522d">had a major
influence on modern political thought in the West. </font>A minority
(including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) interpreted <font color="#228b22">The
</font>Prince<font color="#228b22"> </font>as a satire intended to be
given to <font color="#191970">the Medicis after </font>they had
retaken Florence and expelled Machiavelli from Florence. Although the
work was written for the di Medici family to perhaps influence them
to release Machiavelli from exile, Machiavelli was <font color="#8b0000">more
</font>in favour of <font color="#8b0000">a Florentine republic than
the oligarchy of the di Medici family</font>. In any case,
Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view
of politics, in which good and evil are merely means to an end: a
secure and powerful state. <font color="#483d8b">Thomas Hobbes</font>,
well known for his social contract theory, extended this view in the
early 1600s during the English Renaissance. Although Machiavelli and
Hobbes did not believe in the divine right of kings, they both
believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. This belief
necessarily led them to accept strong central power as the only way
to prevent the breakdown of the social order.</p>

to a particular group of people who used the institutions of the
state and created laws and regulations that bound people, including
themselves. This conceptual distinction still operates in political
science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians

particular </font>exemplified this new era of political theory with
his <font color="#dcdcdc">Two Treatises of Government</font>. In it,
Locke presents a theory of the state of nature that directly
complements his understanding of how <font color="#2f4f4f">political
development </font>occurs and how it can be established by
contractual obligations. Locke set out to overturn <font color="#556b2f">Sir

Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept

as a social animal strives to be happy in a state of social harmony</font>.
Contrary to the prevailing Aquinasian view of the soul's salvation

century, alongside liberalism and fascism. The <font color="#556b2f">industrial

Marx created the principles that the future revolutionaries of the

away from the past. Although Hegel's philosophy of history resembles

Hegel believed in the phenomenology of the spirit. By the end of the

Bronze was a very useful alloy for the ancients because it is much

another common metal alloy. In ancient times, however, it could only
be produced as an occasional by-product of heating iron ore in a fire
(smelting) during iron making. Other ancient alloys include tin,
brass and pig iron. In modern times, steel can be produced in many
forms. Carbon steel can be made by varying only the carbon content,
resulting in soft alloys such as mild steel or hard alloys such as
spring steel. Alloy steels can be made by adding other elements, such
as molybdenum, vanadium or nickel, to produce alloys such as high
speed steel or tool steel. Small amounts of <font color="#a0522d">manganese
</font>are usually added to most modern steels as it removes unwanted

exert a tensile force on their neighbours, helping the alloy to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When a molten metal is mixed with
another substance, the <font color="#a9a9a9">mixture </font>can form
by two mechanisms called atomic exchange and interstitial exchange.
The relative size of each element in the mixture is of primary
importance in determining which mechanism is involved. When the atoms
are relatively similar in size, an atom-exchange mechanism usually
occurs in which some of the atoms forming metal crystals are replaced
by atoms from another constituent. This is called a <font color="#dcdcdc">substitution
mixture</font>. Examples of <font color="#2f4f4f">substitutional
alloys </font>are <font color="#556b2f">bronze and brass</font>,
where some of the copper atoms are replaced by either tin or zinc
atoms. In the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much
smaller than the other, so it cannot successfully replace an atom in
the base metal crystals. The smaller atoms become trapped in spaces
between atoms in the crystal matrix, called interstitials. This is
called an interstitial alloy. <font color="#6b8e23">Steel </font>is
an example of an interstitial alloy because very small carbon atoms
fit into the spaces between the iron matrix. Stainless steel is an
example of a combination of <font color="#a0522d">interstitial and
</font><font color="#228b22">substitutional alloy </font>because the
carbon atoms fit in the spaces, but some of the iron atoms are
replaced by nickel and chromium atoms.</p>

In the Middle East, people began to alloy copper and zinc <font color="#483d8b">to
make brass.</font> Ancient civilisations took into account the
different properties of the alloy and the different properties it
produced, such as hardness, ductility and melting point, under
different temperature and working temperature conditions, and thus
developed much of the information contained in modern alloy phase
diagrams. Arrowheads of the Chinese Qin Dynasty (c. 200 BC) were
often made with a hard bronze head and a softer bronze tongue, and
the alloys were combined to prevent both blunting and fracture during
use.</p>

</font>discovered precipitation hardening alloys in <font color="#a9a9a9">1906</font>.
Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain aluminium, titanium
and copper alloys, are heat treatable alloys that soften when
<font color="#2f4f4f">quenched </font>(cooled rapidly) and then
<font color="#556b2f">harden over time</font>. After quenching a
three-component alloy of aluminium, copper and magnesium, Wilm found
that the <font color="#6b8e23">hardness of the alloy increased when
it was allowed to age at room temperature. </font>Although the
phenomenon was not explained until 1919, <font color="#a0522d">duralumin
</font>was one of the first 'age-hardening' alloys to be used, and
was soon followed by many other alloys. Because these alloys often
combine high strength with low weight, they became widely used in
many industries, including the construction of modern aircraft.</p>

more than half of them had been arrested on Norfolk Island without
ever having been convicted in a colonial court, and only 15% had been

a leading role in the debate on the constitutional limits on the
<font color="#dcdcdc">king's </font>executive power. He was strongly
opposed to the King's unlimited power and defended the role of
<font color="#2f4f4f">political parties </font>in maintaining a
principled opposition capable of preventing abuses by either the
monarch or certain factions in the government. His most important

on </font><font color="#a0522d">23 April 1770</font>, which Burke
attributed to a 'secret influence' from <font color="#228b22">a
neo-Tory group, which </font>he called '<font color="#8b0000">the
friends of the king', </font>whose system of 'external and internal
administration is commonly called, in the technical language of the
court, the double cabinet'. Britain needed a party with 'an
unswerving adherence to principle and a commitment to unity against
all the temptations of interest'. Party differences, 'whether for
good or ill, are inseparable from free government'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Burke not only presented a peace
agreement to Parliament, he presented <font color="#a9a9a9">four
</font>carefully argued reasons against the use of force. He
presented his objections in a systematic way, focusing on one of them
before moving on to the next. His first concern was that the use of
force should be temporary and that uprisings and protests against
British rule in America should not be. Secondly, Burke was concerned
about the uncertainty as to whether Britain would win the conflict <font color="#dcdcdc">in
America</font>. &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">Arms build-up</font>&quot;,
Burke said, &quot;is not a victory&quot;. Thirdly, Burke raised the
question of damage; it would not be good for the British government
to go to <font color="#556b2f">war in a scorched earth </font>and
have its desired target (America) damaged or even rendered useless.
American colonists could always retreat <font color="#a0522d">to the
mountains, but the </font>land they left behind would probably be
unusable, either accidentally or deliberately. The fourth and final
reason for avoiding the use of force was experience; the British had
never tried to contain an unruly colony by force, and they did not
know if they could, let alone <font color="#228b22">thousands of
miles from </font>home. All these concerns were valid, but some of
them also proved prophetic - the American colonists did not
surrender, despite the dire situation, and the British ultimately
failed to win a war fought on American soil.</p>

democracy <font color="#2f4f4f">for three </font>reasons. First,
government required an intelligence and a breadth of knowledge rarely

governor-general of <font color="#dcdcdc">Bengal, </font>which led to
the trial in <font color="#2f4f4f">1786</font>. His interaction with
the British Empire in India began long before Hastings' impeachment
trial. Parliament had been considering the Indian question for <font color="#556b2f">two
decades before </font>the impeachment<font color="#556b2f">.</font>
The trial was the culmination of years of anxiety and deliberation.
In <font color="#6b8e23">1781, </font>Burke was first able to delve
into issues relating to the East India Company when he was appointed
chairman of the <font color="#a0522d">Commons Select Committee on
East India - from </font>then until the end of the trial, India was
Burke's primary concern. The committee was tasked with 'investigating
alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali and other Indian
problems'. While Burke and the committee were focusing on these
issues, another 'secret' committee was set up to look into the same
matters. The reports of both committees were drafted by Burke. Among
other things, the reports conveyed to the Princes of India that
Britain would not go to war against them and called for the <font color="#228b22">HEIC
</font>to recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for a
substantive change in imperial practice. Speaking to the full House
of Commons on the Committee's report, Burke described the Indian
question as one that &quot;began with 'commerce' but 'ended with

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Initially, Burke did not condemn <font color="#a9a9a9">the
French Revolution</font>. In a letter of 9 August 1789, Burke wrote:
&quot;England looks on with astonishment at the French struggle for
freedom, and does not know whether to blame or applaud it! Although I
thought I had seen something like it going on for many years, there
is still something paradoxical and mysterious about it. It is
impossible not to admire the spirit, but the old Parisian fury has
burst forth in a shocking way.&quot;. The events of <font color="#dcdcdc">5-6
October 1789, </font>when a group of Parisian women marched on
Versailles to force <font color="#2f4f4f">King Louis XVI </font>to
return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to her son
<font color="#556b2f">Richard Burke on </font><font color="#6b8e23">10
October, </font>she said: &quot;I heard today from Laurence, who has
sent me papers confirming the threatening state of France, in which
the constituent elements of human society seem to be disintegrating
and in whose place a world of monsters is being created, in which
Mirabeau is leading as the great anarchist and in which the late
Grand Monarch is as ridiculous as he is a pathetic figure.&quot; On 4
November, <font color="#a0522d">Charles-Jean-François Depont </font>wrote
to Burke asking him to support the revolution<font color="#a0522d">.</font>
Burke replied that all his criticisms of it should be understood as
&quot;merely an expression of scepticism&quot;, but he added: &quot;You
may have undermined the monarchy, but you have not restored liberty&quot;.
In the same month, he described France as a &quot;ruined country&quot;.
Burke first publicly condemned the Revolution in Parliament <font color="#228b22">on

Society a </font>sermon delivered by Dr Richard Price on <font color="#dcdcdc">4
November 1789, </font>entitled <font color="#2f4f4f">A Sermon on the

the <font color="#556b2f">Glorious Revolution of </font><font color="#6b8e23">1688</font>.
In this sermon, Price advocated a philosophy of <font color="#a0522d">universal
'human rights'.</font> Price argued that love of country 'implies no
conviction of its superior worth to other countries, or any
particular preference for its laws and system of government'.
Instead, Price argued that <font color="#228b22">English people
</font>should see themselves '<font color="#191970">as citizens of
the world </font>rather than as members of any particular community'.</p>

</font>Burke would soon publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its
British supporters, but he spent the whole year revising and

became an instant bestseller. At <font color="#556b2f">five shillings
a </font>pamphlet, it was more expensive than most political
pamphlets, but by the end of 1790, ten editions had been printed and
some <font color="#6b8e23">17 500 </font>copies had been sold. The

Why? Because when such thoughts are brought to our minds, it is
natural that we should be influenced by them&quot;. Burke defended
this prejudice on the ground that it is &quot;the general bank and
capital of nations and ages&quot; and superior to individual reason,
which is small in comparison. &quot;Prejudice,&quot; Burke argued,
&quot;may be quickly applied in an emergency; it engages the mind in
advance in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave
man hesitating at the moment of decision, doubtful, perplexed, and
undecided.&quot; Prejudice makes a man's virtue a habit&quot;. Burke
criticises <font color="#191970">social contract theory </font>by

Reflections was his description of the events of <font color="#a9a9a9">5-6
October 1789 </font>and <font color="#dcdcdc">Marie-Antoinette's </font>part
in them. Burke's description differs little from that of modern
historians who have used primary sources. However, his use of flowery
language in his description attracted both praise and criticism.
<font color="#2f4f4f">Philip Francis </font>wrote to Burke that what
he wrote about Marie-Antoinette was '<font color="#556b2f">sheer
nonsense</font>'. <font color="#6b8e23">Edward Gibbon</font>,
however, took a different view: &quot;I admire her chivalry&quot;. An
Englishman who spoke to the Duchess of Biron told Burke that when
Marie-Antoinette read the passage in question, <font color="#a0522d">she
burst into tears </font>and took a long time to finish it. Price had
rejoiced that the King of France had been 'led to victory' during the
October Days, but <font color="#228b22">for Burke </font>this
symbolised the counter-revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and
their natural feelings, which, to his horror, shared his own view -
that the shameless attack on Marie-Antoinette was a cowardly attack
on a defenceless woman.</p>

Duke of Devonshire, Lord John Cavendish, Montagu (Frederick Montagu
MP) and many other representatives of the old Whig Stamina the

member of <font color="#dcdcdc">the French National Assembly, </font>wrote
to Burke, praising Reflections and asking for more &quot;very

did, in <font color="#2f4f4f">April 1791</font>, when he published <font color="#556b2f">a
Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. </font>Burke called on
outside forces to reverse the course of the revolution, attacking,
among others, the late French philosopher <font color="#6b8e23">Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, who was the </font>object of a personality cult that had
developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke acknowledged that
Rousseau sometimes showed a '<font color="#a0522d">remarkable
understanding of </font>human nature<font color="#a0522d">', </font>he
was mostly critical of him. Although he did not meet Rousseau when he
visited Britain in <font color="#228b22">1766-7, </font>Burke was a
friend of <font color="#191970">David Hume</font>, with whom Rousseau
had stayed. According to Burke, Rousseau 'had no other principle to
affect his heart or guide his understanding than vanity', which
'possessed him almost to the point of madness'. He also cited
Rousseau's <font color="#8b0000">Confessions </font>as proof that
Rousseau's life was full of &quot;obscure and vulgar vices&quot;
which were not &quot;screened or dotted here and there with virtues,
or even distinguished by any single good deed&quot;. Burke contrasted
Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence with the fact that
Rousseau had sent his children to a foundling hospital: 'He loves his
kind, but hates his kin'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">These events and the resulting
disagreements within the Whig Party led to its disintegration and the
severing of Burke's friendship with Fox. In a debate in Parliament on
Britain's relations <font color="#a9a9a9">with Russia, </font>Fox
praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was unable
to respond, being 'under the constant cries of questioning from his
own side of the House'. When Parliament debated the Quebec bill on
the Canadian constitution, Fox praised the revolution and criticised
some of Burke's arguments, such as <font color="#dcdcdc">hereditary
</font>power. On <font color="#2f4f4f">6 May 1791</font>, when the
second debate on the Quebec bill took place in Parliament, <font color="#556b2f">Burke
</font>took the opportunity to reply to Fox and denounce the new
<font color="#6b8e23">French </font>constitution and 'the terrible
consequences which flow from the French idea of the rights of man'.
Burke argued that these ideas were the antithesis of both the British
and US constitutions. Burke was interrupted and <font color="#a0522d">Fox
</font>intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to continue
speaking. However, a motion of censure was moved against Burke for
his remarks on French affairs, and Lord Sheffield moved a motion of
censure, which Fox seconded. Mr Pitt made a speech in praise of
Burke, and Mr Fox made a speech in which he both <font color="#228b22">criticised
and praised </font>Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who
seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting

be replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow was dealt to Burke
when, <font color="#2f4f4f">in August 1794, </font>he lost Richard,
to whom he had been tenderly attached and in whom he saw signs of
promise which were not open to others and which, in fact, seemed
non-existent (although this view may rather have reflected the fact
that Richard Burke had been successful in the early struggle for
Catholic emancipation). <font color="#556b2f">King George III, </font>whose
favour Burke had won by his attitude to the French Revolution, wanted
to make him Earl of <font color="#6b8e23">Beaconsfield</font>, but
the death of his son deprived him of such an honour and all its
attractions, so the only reward he agreed to accept was a pension of

attacked by <font color="#228b22">the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of
Lauderdale, </font>to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble
Lord (1796): 'It cannot at present be too often repeated, line by
line, precept by precept, until it becomes the proverb: &quot;Reform
is not reform&quot;'. He claimed that he was rewarded on merit, but
the Duke of Bedford was rewarded purely on inheritance, his ancestor
being the original pensioner: 'My pension was from a gentle and
benevolent sovereign, his pension from Henry the Eighth'. Burke also
hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary
ideas were realised, and included a description of the British
constitution:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Writing to a friend in May 1795,
Burke identified the causes of discontent: 'either <font color="#2f4f4f">Indianism
</font>[i.e. the corporate tyranny of the <font color="#556b2f">British

<font color="#6b8e23">Jacobinism </font>as it affects the whole of

itself. The latter is the <font color="#228b22">greatest evil</font>&quot;.
By <font color="#191970">March 1796, </font>however, Burke had
changed his mind<font color="#191970">: </font>'Our government and
our laws are threatened by two different enemies, which are eroding
its foundations: Indianism and Jacobinism. In some cases they act
separately, in others together: but of this I am certain, that the
first is by far the worst and most difficult to deal with, and among
other reasons, that it weakens and destroys the power which ought to
be used with the greatest credibility and vigour against the second,
and that it gives Jacobinism the strongest weapons against all
official government.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Burke believed that <font color="#a9a9a9">property
</font>was essential to human life. Because Burke was convinced that
people wanted to be controlled and governed, the distribution of
property formed the basis of a social structure that helped to
develop control <font color="#dcdcdc">within the property </font>hierarchy.
He saw the <font color="#2f4f4f">social changes brought about by
property as a </font>natural sequence of events that should occur as
humanity progressed. He also believed that the <font color="#556b2f">division
of property </font>and the class system kept the ruler in check with
the needs of the classes below him. Since property largely harmonised
or defined the social class divisions, class was also seen as a
natural part of the social contract, whereby the placing of persons
in different classes was in the common interest of <font color="#6b8e23">all
subjects</font>. Concern about property is not Burke's only
influence. As <font color="#a0522d">Christopher Hitchens </font>summarizes,
&quot;If modern conservatism can be traced back to <font color="#228b22">Burke</font>,
it is not only because he appealed to property owners for stability,
but also because he appealed to the everyday interest in <font color="#191970">preserving

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">In the 19th
century, </font>both liberals and conservatives praised Burke<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Burke's friend <font color="#dcdcdc">Philip Francis </font>wrote
that Burke &quot;was a man who truly and prophetically foresaw all
the consequences that would result from the adoption of French
principles&quot;, but because Burke wrote so <font color="#2f4f4f">passionately</font>,
people doubted his arguments. <font color="#556b2f">William Windham
</font>spoke from the same House of Commons bench as Burke had spoken
from after his resignation from Fox, and one observer said Windham
spoke 'like the ghost of Burke' when he made a speech against peace
with France in <font color="#6b8e23">1801</font>. William Hazlitt,
Burke's political opponent, considered Burke to be among his three
favourite writers (the others being <font color="#a0522d">Junius and
Rousseau) </font>and considered 'the test of the reason and integrity
of a man of the opposite party was whether he would allow Burke to be
a great man'. William Wordsworth was originally a supporter of the
French Revolution and attacked Burke in his Letter to the Bishop of
Llandaff (<font color="#228b22">1793), </font>but by the early 19th
century he had changed his mind and began to admire Burke. In Two
Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland, Wordsworth called Burke
'the wisest politician of his age', whose predictions 'have been
confirmed by time'. He later revised his poem The Prelude to include
Burke's praise ('Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious
wonders') and described him as an old oak. Samuel Taylor Coleridge
experienced a similar reversal: he had criticised Burke in The
Watchman, but in Friend (1809-10) Coleridge defended Burke against
accusations of inconsistency. Later, in Biographia Literaria (1817),
Coleridge considers Burke a prophet and praises Burke for referring
'habitually to principles. He was a scientific statesman and
therefore a seer'. Henry Brougham wrote of Burke: '... all his
prophecies, with one momentary expression, were more than fulfilled:
anarchy and bloodshed had taken France, conquest and convulsions had
ravaged Europe... the providence of mortals is often unable to
penetrate so far into the future as this'. George Canning believed
that Burke's speculations &quot;have been justified by the course of
subsequent events, and almost all the predictions have been
accurately fulfilled&quot;. In <font color="#191970">1823 </font>Canning
wrote that he considered Burke's 'last works and words as a manual of
my political action'. Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli
&quot;was deeply acquainted with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's
later writings&quot;.</p>

William Ewart Gladstone regarded Burke as &quot;the magazine of

wrote in his diary, &quot;I made many extracts from Burke - sometimes
almost divine&quot;. The radical MP and opponent of the <font color="#2f4f4f">Corn

considered Burke one of the three greatest liberals, along with
William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay wrote
in his diary. Admirable! <font color="#6b8e23">The </font>greatest
man since <font color="#6b8e23">Milton</font>&quot;. John Morley, the
Liberal MP for Gladstone, published <font color="#a0522d">two </font>books
on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke,
including his views on prejudice. For the Cobden radical <font color="#228b22">Francis
Hirst</font>, Burke 'deserved a place among English libertarians,
though he was the most conservative of all lovers of liberty and
reformers, the least abstract, always seeking to preserve and reform
rather than to reform. In politics, he resembled a modern architect
who renovates an old house rather than tearing it down and building a
new one in its place'. Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in
France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after
his death it became his most famous and influential work and a
manifesto of conservative thought.</p>

reigned as Pope from <font color="#556b2f">21 June 1963 </font>until
his death in 1978. As successor to Pope John XXIII, he continued the
Second Vatican Council, which he had concluded in <font color="#6b8e23">1965</font>,
and implemented its numerous reforms and promoted better ecumenical
relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, leading to many
historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican
Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of
State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered the closest and
most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, and in 1954 Pope Pius
XII appointed Montini Archbishop of Milan, the largest diocese in
Italy. Montini automatically became secretary of the Italian Bishops'
Conference. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals by John XXIII
in 1958, and after John XXIII's death Montini was considered one of
his most likely successors.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When Montini was elected Pope, he
took the papal name Paul VI (the first to take the name <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;Paul&quot;
</font>since <font color="#dcdcdc">1605</font>) to signify a renewed
worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the
example of the Apostle St Paul.He reconvened the <font color="#2f4f4f">Second
Vatican Council, which </font>had automatically ended with the death
of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the Council
had completed its work, Paul VI took over the interpretation and
implementation of its mandates, often walking a fine line between the
conflicting expectations of the various factions of Catholicism. The
breadth and depth of the reforms which affected all areas of Church
life during his pontificate went beyond the similar reform policies
of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a <font color="#556b2f">Marian
</font>devotee who spoke repeatedly at Marian congresses and
Mariological meetings, visited Marian shrines and published three
Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor, St Ambrose of
Milan, he appointed Mary Mother of the Church at the Second Vatican
Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other
Christians, other religions and atheists, without excluding anyone.
He saw himself as a humble servant of a suffering humanity and
demanded significant changes from the rich of North America and
Europe for the poor of the Third World. His views on birth control,
most famously published in the 1968 <font color="#6b8e23">cycle
Humanae vitae, </font>and other political issues were often
controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Liturgical reform had been part of
the liturgical movements of the 20th century, mainly in France and
Germany, which Pius XII officially recognised in his Mediator Dei
cycle. During Pius XII's pontificate, the Vatican relaxed the
regulations on the use of <font color="#a9a9a9">Latin </font>in Roman
Catholic liturgies and allowed some use of vernacular languages for
baptisms, funerals and other celebrations. In 1951 and 1955, the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Easter liturgies </font>were revised, and in
particular the <font color="#2f4f4f">Easter Triduum </font>was
reintroduced. Vatican II did not make any changes to the Roman
Missal, but mandated its general revision in Sacrosanctum Concilium.
After the Vatican Council, in April 1969, Paul VI approved a 'new
<font color="#556b2f">order of the Mass', </font>promulgated in 1970,
as stated in the Acta Apostolica Sedis, to 'put an end to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Paul VI's Mass was also in Latin,
but the use of vernacular languages was accepted. The Pope had issued
other directives in 1964, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970, focusing on the
reform of all liturgies in the Church of Rome. These major reforms
were not welcomed by all and in all countries. The sudden apparent
'banning' of <font color="#dcdcdc">the 400-year-old </font>Mass, the
last typical edition of which had been promulgated only a few years
earlier in 1962 by Paul's predecessor John XXIII, was not always well
explained. Some saw as vandalism the fact that liturgists were still
experimenting with new Masses, such as the use of pop and folk music
(as opposed to <font color="#2f4f4f">the Gregorian chant </font>advocated
by Pope Pius X), and the simultaneous changes in the order of
shrines. <font color="#556b2f">In </font>2007, <font color="#6b8e23">Pope
Benedict XVI </font>clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and
the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman rite, the
first of which, which had never been &quot;juridically abrogated&quot;,
is now &quot;an extraordinary form of the Roman rite&quot;, while the
second &quot;is and remains the normal form of the Eucharistic
liturgy - Forma ordinaria&quot;.</p>

caelibatus </font>(Latin for &quot;celibate priesthood&quot;),
published on 24 June 1967, defends the Catholic Church's tradition of
priestly freedom in the West. This encyclical was written after
Vatican II, when the Catholic Church questioned and revised many
long-standing practices. Priestly liberty was seen as a discipline
rather than a dogma, and some had expected it to be relaxed. In
response to these questions, the Pope reaffirms that celibacy is a
long-standing practice with a special significance in the Catholic
Church. The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus of 24 June 1967
confirms the Church's traditional teaching that celibacy is the ideal
state and remains obligatory for Roman Catholic priests. <font color="#dcdcdc">Celibacy
</font>symbolises the reality of the Kingdom of God in the midst of
modern society. Priestly celibacy is closely linked to the
sacramental priesthood. However, while Paul VI was considered
generous during his pontificate in allowing bishops to grant
legitimacy to priests who wished to leave the priesthood, John Paul
II sharply reversed this position in 1980 and cemented in the <font color="#2f4f4f">1983

July 1968. In it, he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's traditional

the latest advances in science and medicine on the issue of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 34</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">For the Pope, as for all his
predecessors, <font color="#a9a9a9">marriage </font>is much more than
a union between two people. They form a union of a loving couple and
a loving <font color="#dcdcdc">God</font>, in which the two persons
create a new person materially, while God completes the creation by
adding <font color="#2f4f4f">a soul.</font> This is why Paul VI
teaches in the first sentence of Humanae vitae that the
transplantation of human life is the most serious task, in which the
spouses freely and responsibly cooperate with God the Creator. This
divine partnership, according to Paul VI, does not permit arbitrary
human decisions that may limit divine providence. The Pope does not
paint too romantic a picture of marriage: it is a source of great
joy, but also of difficulties and hardship. For Paul VI, the question
of human reproduction goes beyond the disciplines of biology,
psychology, demography or sociology. The reason for this, according
to Paul VI, is that conjugal love has its origin in <font color="#556b2f">God,
</font>who 'is love'. It is from this fundamental value that he
defines his position:</p>

artificial birth control in Enkyrika was very mixed. In Italy, Spain,
Portugal and Poland, encyclical was welcomed. In Latin America, the
Pope and his encyclical developed strong support. When World Bank
President <font color="#a9a9a9">Robert McNamara </font>declared at
the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank Group in 1968 that countries that allowed contraceptive
practices would be privileged to receive resources, doctors in La

conditionality undermines the Pope's teachings, we would rather not

the Humanae vitae document could be debated in terms of its
implications for individual conscience, but that it was most
significant because the Pope's document defended the right of
developing countries to determine their own population policies. The
Jesuit magazine Sic devoted an issue to the encyclical and published
articles in support of it.</p>

itself recognised from many previous ecumenical meetings that much
needed to be done internally to be an open partner in ecumenism. To
those entrusted with the highest and deepest truth, and therefore
Paul VI believed that he had the most difficult task to mediate. For
Paul VI, ecumenical dialogue required the <font color="#2f4f4f">whole
</font><font color="#556b2f">person </font>of the Catholic: the whole
mind, will and heart. Paul VI, like Pius XII before him, did not want
to give in at the lowest possible point. Yet Paul felt compelled to
confess his fervent, gospel-based desire to be all things to all
people and to help all people. As a follower of Peter, he felt
<font color="#6b8e23">Christ's </font>words, 'Do you love me more',
like a sharp knife plunging into the marrow of his soul. For Paul VI,

continued the policy of internationalisation begun by Pius XII in

There were voices within the Church at the time that the European
period of the Church was coming to an end, including the British
Cardinal Basil Hume. At the same time, the members of the College of
Cardinals lost some of their former influence after Paul VI decreed
that not only cardinals but also bishops could participate in the

were simple electrostatic devices developed by a Scottish monk,
<font color="#a9a9a9">Andrew Gordon, </font>in the 1740s. The
theoretical principle of generating mechanical power through the
interaction of an electric current and a magnetic field, Ampère's
power law, was later discovered by <font color="#dcdcdc">André-Marie
Ampère in </font>1820. The conversion of electrical energy into
mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the
British scientist Michael Faraday in <font color="#2f4f4f">1821</font>.
A freely suspended wire was immersed in a pool of mercury and a
permanent magnet (PM) was placed on top. When a current was passed
through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, indicating that
the current created a tight circular magnetic field around the wire.
This engine is often demonstrated in physics experiments where toxic
<font color="#556b2f">mercury is </font>replaced by salt water.
Although Barlow's wheel was an early improvement on Faraday's
demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were not suitable
for practical applications until the end of the century.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1886, <font color="#a9a9a9">Frank
Julian Sprague </font>invented the first practical DC motor, a
non-sparking motor whose speed remained relatively constant under
varying loads. Other electrical inventions by Sprague at this time
greatly improved the electrical distribution of electricity from the
power grid (earlier work done for <font color="#dcdcdc">Thomas
Edison</font>), enabled the power of electric motors to be restored
to the power grid, allowed electrical power to be distributed to
carriages via overhead wires and carriage poles, and provided
electrical controls for operations. This enabled Sprague to use
electric motors to invent the first <font color="#2f4f4f">electric
trolley system </font>in 1887-88 in Richmond, VA, an electric
elevator and control system in 1892, and an electric subway with
independently operated centrally controlled cars, first installed in
1892 in Chicago <font color="#556b2f">on the South Side Elevated
Railway, </font>where it was popularly known as the &quot;L&quot;.
Sprague's engine and related inventions sparked an explosion of
interest in electric motors and their use in industry, while almost
simultaneously another great inventor was developing their primary
competitor, which became much more common. The development of
electric motors with acceptable efficiency was delayed for several
decades because the extreme importance of the relatively <font color="#6b8e23">small
air gap </font>between rotor and stator was not recognised. The St.
Louis motor, long used in classrooms to illustrate the principles of
motors, is for the same reason extremely inefficient and does not

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1824, the French physicist
François Arago proposed the existence of rotating magnetic fields,
known as Arago's rotations, which <font color="#a9a9a9">Walter Baily
</font>demonstrated in 1879 by manually turning switches on and off,
and which were in effect the first rudimentary induction motor.  In
the 1880s, many inventors tried to develop working AC motors because
the advantages of AC in long-distance high-voltage transmission were
counterbalanced by the inability to run motors <font color="#2f4f4f">on
AC. </font><font color="#556b2f">Galileo Ferraris </font>and Nikola
Tesla independently invented the first AC commutatorless induction
motors, with the former presenting a working motor model in 1885 and
the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Sciences of Turin
published a study by Ferrari which detailed the principles of the
motor's operation, but stated that 'a device based on this principle
cannot have any commercial value as a motor'. In 1888, Tesla
presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and
Transformers to the AIEE, in which he described three patented
two-phase four-pole four-pole motor types: one four-pole rotor formed
a non-self-starting reluctance motor, a second twisted rotor formed a
self-starting induction motor, and the third was a true synchronous
motor in which the rotor winding is separately energized by a DC
supply. However, one of Tesla's patents filed in 1887 also described
a short-circuited wound rotor induction motor. <font color="#6b8e23">George
Westinghouse </font>promptly bought Tesla's patents, hired Tesla to
develop them and commissioned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, but Tesla
left for other assignments in 1889.  The constant-speed AC induction
motor proved unsuitable for street cars, but Westinghouse's engineers
successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride,
Colorado, in 1891. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky was a staunch promoter
of the three-stage development, inventing the three-stage cage rotor
induction motor in 1889 and the three-phase transformer in 1890. This
type of motor is used today in most commercial applications. However,
he argued that Tesla's motor was not viable because of the two-phase
pulses, which prompted him to continue his three-phase work. Although
Westinghouse achieved his first practical induction motor in 1892 and
developed a series of 60 hertz multiphase induction motors in 1893,
these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with a wound
rotor until B. G. Lamme developed the rotary bar wound rotor. The
General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction
motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a
cross-licensing agreement for the bar wound rotor, later called the
squirrel cage rotor. Induction engines improved so much as a result
of these inventions and innovations that a 100 horsepower (HP)
induction engine today has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP
engine in 1897.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 12</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many of the limitations of a classic
DC motor with a commutator are due to the fact that the brushes have
to be pressed against <font color="#a9a9a9">the commutator</font>.
This causes <font color="#dcdcdc">friction</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Sparks
</font>are created when the brushes form and break circuits through
the rotor windings as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between
the <font color="#556b2f">commutator </font>parts. Depending on the
construction of the commutator, this can include the brushes
short-circuiting adjacent parts - and thus the ends of the coil -
momentarily as they cross the gaps. In addition, the inductance of
the rotor windings causes the <font color="#6b8e23">voltage of </font>each
coil to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of
the brushes. This sparking limits the <font color="#a0522d">maximum
speed of </font>the machine<font color="#a0522d">, as </font>too
rapid sparking will overheat, wear out or even melt the commutator.
The current density of the brushes per unit area, combined with their
resistivity, limits the power of the motor. Making and breaking
electrical contact also causes electrical noise; <font color="#228b22">sparking
</font>causes RFI. <font color="#191970">The brushes </font>eventually
wear out and need to be replaced, and the commutator itself wears out
and needs to be serviced (for larger motors) or replaced (for smaller
motors). The commutator assembly for a large motor is an expensive
element that requires precise assembly of many parts. In small
engines, the commutator is usually permanently integrated in the
rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the entire rotor.</p>

control of an internal combustion engine's throttle valve in
combination with an electronic governor. In this application, the
engine acts as a return spring counterweight to move the throttle in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A synchronous electric motor is an
AC motor characterised by a rotor that rotates on windings that pass
by magnets in synchrony with the AC current and the magnetic field
that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it <font color="#a9a9a9">has
no </font><font color="#dcdcdc">slip </font>under normal operating
conditions. Unlike an induction motor, which must slip to produce
torque. One type of synchronous motor is similar to an induction
motor, but the rotor is excited by <font color="#556b2f">a DC field.
</font><font color="#6b8e23">Slip rings and brushes are used </font>to
conduct the current to the rotor. The rotor poles are coupled
together and move at the same speed, hence the name synchronous
motor. The second type, intended to produce low load torque, has flat
blades grounded to a conventional squirrel-cage rotor, forming
separate poles. The second type of motor, such as Hammond's pre-World
War II bells and the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and
has separate poles. It is not self-starting. The bell has to be
started <font color="#a0522d">manually by a </font>small knob on the

described above require that the iron (steel) parts of the rotor
actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made
in the form of a cylinder, the torque is applied (apart from the
effect of hysteresis) only to the windings of the electromagnets. The
coreless or ironless DC motor which takes advantage of this fact is a
special type of PM DC motor. These motors, optimised for <font color="#a9a9a9">high

</font>consisting only of magnetic wire and bonding material. The
rotor fits inside the magnets of the stator; a magnetically soft
stationary cylinder inside the rotor forms the magnetic flux return
path of the stator. In another arrangement, the rotor winding
encloses the stator magnets. In this arrangement, the rotor fits
within the magnetically soft cylinder, which can act as a motor
housing, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Stepper motors can be easily rotated
to a specific angle in separate steps, which is why they are used to
position the read and write heads of computer disk drives. They were
used for the same purpose before the gigabyte era in computer disk
drives, where the accuracy and speed they provided was sufficient to
correctly position the read and write heads of a hard disk drive. As
drive density increased, the <font color="#a9a9a9">accuracy and speed
limitations of </font>stepper motors made them obsolete in hard disk
drives - the accuracy limitation made them unusable and the speed
limitation made them uncompetitive - so newer hard disk drives use
<font color="#dcdcdc">voice-coil-based main drive systems</font>.
(The term &quot;voice coil&quot; is historical in this context; it
refers to <font color="#556b2f">the design of a typical (cone-type)

positioning. Modern inverters have a pivoting coil mount; the coil
swings back and forth, a bit like the blade of a rotating fan.

combination of <font color="#a9a9a9">Switzer</font>, an obsolete term
for Swiss, which was in use in the 1500s and 1900s. The English
adjective Swiss is a loan from <font color="#dcdcdc">the French word
Suisse, which has </font>also been in use since the 1500s. The name
Switzer is derived from <font color="#2f4f4f">the Low German </font>name
Schwiizer, which was derived from the inhabitants of Schwyz and the
surrounding region, one of the cantons of Waldstätten, which formed
the core of<font color="#556b2f"> the old Swiss Confederation.</font>
The name originated as an exonym used for the pars pro toto
Confederate troops. The Swiss began to use the name for themselves
after the Swiss War of 1499, and it was used in conjunction with the
name Eidgenossen (literally: comrades by oath), which had been in use
since the 13th century.</p>

three basic topographical areas: the <font color="#a9a9a9">Swiss Alps
</font>in the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau in the

lives in the <font color="#556b2f">Swiss </font>plateau. The high
valleys of the Swiss Alps contain many glaciers, covering a total
area of 1,063 square kilometres. They are the source of the main
waters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and
Rhône, which flow in four directions throughout Europe. The
hydrographic network includes several of the largest freshwater
bodies in central and western Europe, including Lake Geneva (also
known as Lac Léman in French), Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in
German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1,500 lakes and
holds 6% of Europe's freshwater reserves. Lakes and glaciers cover
about 6% of the country's surface area. The largest lake is Lake
Geneva, located in western Switzerland and shared with France. The
Rhône is both the main source and outlet of Lake Geneva. Lake
Constance is the second largest lake in Switzerland and<font color="#6b8e23">,
like Lake Geneva, is the </font>intermediate point of the Rhine on
the Austrian-German border. Although the Rhône flows into the
Mediterranean Sea in the Camarque region of France and the Rhine into

French and Italian) have terms called <font color="#a9a9a9">helvetisms</font>,
which are not used outside Switzerland. Helvetisms are, roughly
speaking, a large number of words typical of Swiss Standard German
that do not appear in Standard German or in other German dialects.
These include terms from surrounding linguistic cultures in
Switzerland (German billette from French), from a similar term in
another language (Italian azione, used not only as an act but also as
a reduction of German Aktion). In the French spoken in Switzerland,
there are similar terms, equally known as helvetisms. The most common
features of Helvetisms are <font color="#dcdcdc">in vocabulary,
phrases and pronunciation</font>, but certain Helvetisms are also
specific in syntax and orthography. Duden, one of the sources for
defining standard German, knows about 3000 helvetisms. Modern French
dictionaries, such as Petit Larousse, contain several hundred
<font color="#2f4f4f">helvetisms.</font></p>

in most parts of the country majorities have been plural. Geneva
converted to <font color="#a9a9a9">Protestantism</font> in <font color="#a9a9a9">1536</font>,
just before John Calvin arrived there. One canton, Appenzell, was
officially divided into Catholic and Protestant parts in 1597. The
major cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich and
Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland,
Valais, Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, Jura and Fribourg are
traditionally Catholic. The Swiss constitution of 1848, freshly
inspired by the clashes between Catholic and Protestant cantons that
culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, deliberately defines an
associative state <font color="#dcdcdc">allowing peaceful coexistence
between Catholics and Protestants</font>. A <font color="#2f4f4f">1980
</font>initiative calling for the complete separation of church and
state was rejected by <font color="#556b2f">78.9% of </font>voters.
Some traditionally Protestant cantons and towns now have a slight
Catholic majority, not because their membership has increased, on the
contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing
minority has not belonged to any church or other religious body (21,4
% in Switzerland in 2012), especially in traditionally Protestant
areas such as the city of Basel (42 %), the canton of Neuchâtel (38
