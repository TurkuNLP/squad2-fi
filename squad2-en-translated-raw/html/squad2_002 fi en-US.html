<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The HDI index is derived from the
annual development reports of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). They were conceived and launched in 1990 by
Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq with the explicit aim of &quot;shifting
the focus of development economics from national income accounting <font color="#dcdcdc">to
people-centred policy</font>&quot;. For the Human Development
Reports, Mahbub ul Haq set up a group of development economists
including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith
Griffin, Sudhir Anand and Meghnad Desai. They worked with Nobel
laureate <font color="#2f4f4f">Amartya Sen </font>on capabilities and
functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was
convinced that a simple composite measure of human development was
needed to convince the public, researchers and policy makers that
development can and should be judged not only by economic progress
but also by improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed
this idea, but soon helped Haq to develop the index. He was concerned
that the full complexity of human resources would be difficult to
capture in a single index, but Haq convinced him that a single figure
would shift the immediate attention of policy-makers from economic
well-being to human well-being.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard
Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer discuss the HDI from the perspective
of data errors in health, education and income statistics used to
construct the HDI. They identify <font color="#a9a9a9">three </font>sources
of data error due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions, and
(iii) thresholds for classifying a country's level of development,
and conclude that 11%, 21%, and 34% of all countries can currently be
misclassified in the level of development categories due to these
three sources of data error. The authors suggest that the United
Nations should stop classifying countries into development categories
because, they argue, the thresholds appear arbitrary, can provide
incentives for strategic behaviour in the reporting of official
statistics and have the potential to mislead politicians, investors,
charitable donors and the HDI-using public. <font color="#dcdcdc">In
2010, the UNDP </font>responded to the criticism by updating the
thresholds for classifying countries into low, medium and high human
development countries. In an early January 2011 comment <font color="#2f4f4f">to
The Economist, </font>the Human Development Report Office responded
to the magazine's January 6, 2011 article on the Wolff et al.
article. The Human Development Report Office states that it has
undertaken a systematic review of the HDI calculation methodology and
that the new methodology directly addresses the Wolff et al.
criticism by creating a system that allows the human development
categories to be continuously updated whenever formulas or data are
revised.</p>

when the BBC transmitter was operating in London, and by 1930

electronically scanned television </font>began on 2 November 1936
from Alexandra Palace in London for just a few hundred viewers in the
surrounding area. The first programme to be broadcast - and therefore
the first ever, on a dedicated television channel - was the &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">BBC
Television Service Opening</font>&quot; at 3pm. The first major
outside broadcast was the <font color="#a0522d">coronation of</font><font color="#228b22">
King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in </font>May 1937. The service
reached an estimated 25 000 to 40 000 households before the outbreak

being suspended </font><font color="#8b0000">in September 1939.</font>
VHF transmissions would have been an ideal radio beacon for German
bombers trying to reach London, and the service's engineers and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 4</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Gustav preferred Arnold to his
eldest son <font color="#a9a9a9">Meinhard </font>(17 July 1946 - 20
May 1971). His preference for him was 'strong and blatant' due to the
unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.
Schwarzenegger has said that his father had 'no patience to listen or
understand the problems'. Schwarzenegger was on good terms with his
mother and kept in touch with her until her death. Later in life,
Schwarzenegger commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to examine
his father's wartime records, which revealed no evidence that Gustav
had been involved in atrocities, even though he was a member of the
Nazi Party and the SA. Schwarzenegger's father's background received
widespread press attention during the 2003 California recall
campaign. At school, Schwarzenegger was apparently mediocre, but
stood out for his &quot;cheerful, good-humoured and boisterous&quot;
character. Money was an issue in their household; Schwarzenegger
recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family
bought <font color="#dcdcdc">a refrigerator</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As a boy, Schwarzenegger played a
number of sports under the influence of his father. He first picked
up the pole in 1960, when his football coach took his team to a local
gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over football as a
career. Schwarzenegger has answered the question of whether he was 13
when he started weightlifting: &quot;I actually started weight
training when I was 15, but I had been doing sports like football for
years, so I felt that even though I was thin, I was well developed,
at least enough to go to the gym and start Olympic weightlifting.&quot;
However, his biography on his official website claims, &quot;At the
age of 14 he started an intensive training programme with Dan Farmer,
studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over
body) and at 17 officially began his competitive career.&quot; In a
2001 speech he said: &quot;My own plan was formed when I was 14 years
old. My father had wanted me to become a <font color="#dcdcdc">policeman</font>,
as he was. My mother wanted me to go to vocational school.&quot;
Schwarzenegger started going to the gym in Graz, where he also
visited local cinemas to watch bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park,
<font color="#2f4f4f">Steve Reeves </font>and Johnny Weissmuller on
the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger remembered
him fondly. As a teenager, I grew up with Reeves as a teenager. His
remarkable achievements gave me an insight into what was possible
when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve
Reeves has been a part of everything I have been fortunate enough to
achieve.&quot; In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt
Marnul, who invited him to train at a gym in Graz. He was so
dedicated in his youth that he broke into the local gym on weekends,
when it was usually closed, to work out. &quot;I'd be sick of
skipping a workout... I knew I wouldn't be able to look at myself in
the mirror the next morning if I didn't.&quot; When Schwarzenegger
was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: &quot;I
was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the cinemas in
Austria and watching films. The first real film I saw, which I
remember clearly, was a <font color="#556b2f">John Wayne </font>film.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On 20 May 1971, his brother Meinhard
died in a car accident. Meinhard had been drinking and died
instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was
due to marry Erika Knapp and the couple had a three-year-old son
<font color="#dcdcdc">Patrick</font>. Schwarzenegger would pay for
Patrick's education and help him immigrate to the United States.
Gustav died of <font color="#2f4f4f">a stroke the </font>following
year. In Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend
his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding
competition. He and the film's producer later said the story was
taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some people will
go to for their sport, to make Schwarzenegger's image colder and more
mechanical, and to make the film controversial. <font color="#556b2f">Barbara
Baker</font>, Schwarzenegger's first serious girlfriend, has said

I was hit with belts. So was the neighbour's son. That's just the way
it was. Many of the children I saw were broken by their parents,
which was the German-American mentality. They didn't want to create
an individual. It was all about conformity. I was one who didn't
conform and whose will could not be broken. That's why I became a
rebel. Every time I was beaten and every time someone said, &quot;You
can't do this,&quot; I said, &quot;This won't last much longer
because I'm going to move out of here.&quot; This was my mission. I
want to be rich. I want to be somebody.&quot;</p>

He won another bodybuilding competition in Graz, at the Steirer Hof

in Europe, which made him famous. &quot;The <font color="#dcdcdc">Mr.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Charles &quot;Wag&quot; Bennett, one
of the judges of the 1966 competition, was impressed by
Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. Since Schwarzenegger had
little money, Bennett invited him to live in his cramped family
apartment above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London, England.
Yorton's leg definition was assessed as better, and Schwarzenegger
focused on improving the muscle definition and strength of <font color="#a9a9a9">his
legs, </font>following an exercise programme devised by Bennett.
Living in London's East End helped Schwarzenegger improve his
rudimentary English language skills. In 1966, Schwarzenegger also had
the opportunity to meet his childhood idol <font color="#dcdcdc">Reg
Park, who </font>became his friend and mentor. The training paid off
and in 1967 Schwarzenegger won his first world title, becoming the
youngest ever world champion at the age of 20. He went on to win the
title three more times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich,
trained four to six hours a day, went to business school and worked
at a fitness club (<font color="#556b2f">Rolf </font>Putziger's gym,
where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968), and returned to

</font>who wrote an informal biography of Schwarzenegger, claims that
he planned his political rise early on, using the film industry and
bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh
describes Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as
saying, &quot;I wanted to belong to the small minority of people who
are leaders, not the large number of followers. I think it's because
I saw leaders using 100% of their potential - I was always fascinated
by people who controlled other people.&quot; Schwarzenegger has said
it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says: &quot;I
married into a political family. When you meet them, you hear about
politics and helping people. I was given the idea of public service,
and Eunice and <font color="#dcdcdc">Sargent Shriver </font>became my

on 17 September 1983. Shortly before he became a citizen, he asked
the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian

revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship because of his decision
not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley
Williams, which damaged Austria's reputation as the death penalty has
been abolished in Austria since 1968. The claim was based on Article
33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states that &quot;A citizen
who is in the public service of a foreign country shall be deprived
of his citizenship if he seriously damages the reputation or
interests of the Republic of Austria&quot;. Pilz argued that
Schwarzenegger's actions in favour of the death penalty (which is
prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 to the European Convention on
Human Rights) had indeed damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger
explained his actions by the fact that his only duty as governor of

occasionally painted a somewhat flattering picture of his former
lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed a foreword to the
narrative book and met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for
example, that he only found out about Schwarzenegger's infidelity
after they had separated, and describes a tumultuous and passionate
love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their memories of
events may differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his
arrival in the US - their first date was watching <font color="#dcdcdc">Apollo's
first moon landing on </font>television. They shared an apartment in
Santa Monica for three and a half years, and because they had little
money, they would walk on the beach all day or barbecue in the
backyard. Although Baker claims that when he first met Baker, he had
&quot;little understanding of <font color="#2f4f4f">polite society</font>,&quot;
and Baker thought Baker was obnoxious, Baker says: &quot;Baker is as
self-made a man as you can get - he never received any encouragement
from his parents, family or brother. He just had a tremendous
determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive... I
will go to my grave knowing that Arnold loved me.&quot;</p>

Schwarzenegger looked considerably shorter. Prior to his candidacy
for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an
article in the Chicago Reader. As governor, Schwarzenegger had a

Wesson </font>about their height. At one point, Wesson, in his own

measure on the governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a
cushion with the words &quot;Need a lift?&quot; sewn on it on
Wesson's 165-centimetre-tall chair before a negotiating session in

</font>1944, <font color="#dcdcdc">Sir Patrick </font>Abercrombie's
Plymouth Plan for rebuilding the bomb-damaged city was published,
calling for the few remaining wartime buildings in the city centre to
be demolished and replaced by wide, parallel, east-west modern
boulevards connected by a north-south Avenue (<font color="#2f4f4f">Armada
Way) </font>linking the railway station to Plymouth's Hoe Lookout.
The peripheral street system linking the historic Barbican on the
east side and Union Street on the west side continues to define the
main form of the city centre, even after the pedestrianisation of the
shopping centre in the late 1980s, and continues to form the basis of
the current Plymouth Vision, drawn up in 2003 by a working group led
by Barcelona-based architect <font color="#556b2f">David MacKay,
</font>which calls for the regeneration of the city centre through
mixed-use and residential development. Post-war prefabricated
buildings had begun to appear in the suburbs as early as 1946, and
between 1951 and 1957 more than 1 000 permanent council houses were
built each year, following the modernist, low-density, planned garden
city model advocated by Abercrombie. By 1964, over 20 000 new
dwellings had been built, of which over 13 500 were permanent council
houses and 853 were built by the Admiralty. Plymouth has parks28 with
an average size of 45 638 square metres (491 240 square feet). The
largest park is Central Park, while other significant green spaces

other parts of the UK. As a result, summer highs are lower than would

snow in early January; higher altitudes had more snow. Another
significant snowfall episode was on 17-19 December 2010, when up to

to the growing town of Devonport and its ever-expanding dockyard. It
was fed by three rivers on Dartmoor: the West Dart, the Cowsic and
the Blackabrook. It appears to have been carrying water since 1797,
but was officially completed in <font color="#6b8e23">1801</font>. It
was originally designed to carry water to the town of Devonport, but
has since been shortened and now carries water to the Burrator Basin,
where most of Plymouth's water supply comes from. Burrator Reservoir
is located about 5 miles north of the city and was built in 1898 and
extended in 1928.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In England, <font color="#a9a9a9">the
European Reformation of the </font>1500s led to many executions for
heresy. During the thirty-eight years <font color="#2f4f4f">of </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Henry
VIII, </font>some sixty heretics, mainly Protestants, were executed,
and an even greater number of Catholics lost their lives for
political crimes such as treason, notably <font color="#556b2f">Sir
Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher </font>for refusing to accept
the King's supremacy over the Church of England. Under <font color="#6b8e23">Edward
VI, </font>the Heresy Acts were repealed in 1547, but Mary I
reintroduced them in 1554; still, two radicals were executed under
Edward (one for denying the reality of the Incarnation and the other
for denying the divinity of Christ). Under Mary, some two hundred and
ninety people were burnt at the stake between 1555 and 1558, after
the restoration of papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the
throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory, but severely
restricted by a supremacy law in 1559, and about one hundred and
eighty Catholics executed during Elizabeth's forty-five years were
put to death because they were considered to belong to 'the
subversive fifth column'. The last execution of a 'heretic' in
England took place under James VI and I in <font color="#a0522d">1612</font>.
Although the charge was technically 'blasphemy', one person was later
executed in Scotland (then still a fully independent kingdom) when
Thomas Aikenhead was charged in 1697 with, among other things,
denying the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

Soviet Union </font>and <font color="#2f4f4f">seven </font>Central
and Eastern European satellite states that existed <font color="#556b2f">during
the Cold War.</font> The Warsaw Pact was the military complement of
the regional economic organisation of the communist states of Central
and Eastern Europe, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in
Central and Eastern Europe (CoMEcon). The Warsaw Pact was created as
a reaction to <font color="#6b8e23">West Germany's </font>entry into
NATO under the Paris Agreement of 1955, but it is also seen as being
motivated by the Soviet Union's desire to maintain control of
military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

<font color="#dcdcdc">the Soviet Union </font>claimed the right to
define <font color="#2f4f4f">socialism and communism </font>and to

sought a security pact with <font color="#dcdcdc">East Germany and
Poland, </font>fearing that Germany would rearm. These countries were
strongly opposed to the remilitarisation of <font color="#2f4f4f">West
Germany</font>. The Warsaw Pact was created primarily as a result of
the rearmament of West Germany within NATO. <font color="#556b2f">Soviet
leaders</font>, like many European countries both to the west and
east, feared that Germany was again a military power as a direct
threat, and German militarism was still a fresh memory among Soviets
and Eastern Europeans. As the Soviet Union already had bilateral
agreements with all its eastern satellite countries, the treaty was
long considered 'unnecessary' and, because of its hasty design, <font color="#6b8e23">NATO
</font>officials labelled it a 'cardboard castle'. Earlier, in March

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">The Soviet
Union's </font>request to join NATO came after the Berlin Conference
in January and February 1954. <font color="#dcdcdc">Soviet Foreign
Minister </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Molotov </font>made proposals
for the reunification of Germany and the election of a pan-German
government on the condition of the withdrawal of the armies of the
four superpowers and German neutrality, but the other foreign
ministers Dulles (USA), Eden (UK) and Bidault (France) rejected all
proposals. The proposals for German reunification were nothing new:
negotiations on <font color="#6b8e23">German reunification, </font>which
had begun earlier, on 20 March <font color="#556b2f">1952, </font>on
the basis of the so-called 'Stalin Memorandum', came to an end when
the <font color="#a0522d">United Kingdom, France and the United
States </font>insisted that a united Germany should not be neutral
and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm.
James Dunn (USA), who met Eden, Adenauer and Robert Schuman (France)
in Paris, confirmed that &quot;the aim should be to avoid discussions
with the Russians and to put pressure on the European Defence
Community&quot;. According to John Gaddis, 'there was little
inclination in the Western capitals to examine this Soviet offer'.
Although historian Rolf Steininger argues that Adenauer's conviction
that 'neutralisation means Sovietisation' was the main factor in
rejecting the Soviet proposals, Adenauer also feared that unification
might have led to the end of the CDU's dominant position in the
Bundestag.</p>

decided to make a new proposal to the US, British and French

proposed pan-European treaty. Since the Soviet proposal was also
opposed by the argument that the Western powers considered it
'contrary to the North Atlantic Treaty and its dismantling', the
Soviet Union decided to declare itself 'ready to examine with other

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Materialism is often associated with
<font color="#a9a9a9">reductionism</font>, according to which <font color="#dcdcdc">objects
or phenomena identified at one level of description, </font>if they
are genuine, can be explained by objects or phenomena at another
level of description, typically a more restricted level. However,
non-reductive materialism explicitly rejects this view and holds that
the material composition of all particles is consistent with the
existence of real objects, properties or phenomena that cannot be
explained in terms of the basic material components that are
canonically used. Jerry Fodor makes an impressive case for this view
that <font color="#2f4f4f">the empirical laws and explanations of
'special sciences' such as </font><font color="#556b2f">psychology or
geology </font><font color="#2f4f4f">are invisible from the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Ancient Greek philosophers such as
Thales, Anaxagoras (c. 500 BC - 428 BC), Epicurus and Democritus were

<font color="#a9a9a9">Lucretius </font>(c. <font color="#dcdcdc">99
</font>BC <font color="#dcdcdc">- </font>c. 55 BC) reflects the
mechanistic philosophy of <font color="#2f4f4f">Democritus and
Epicurus.</font> According to this view, all that exists is matter
and nothingness, and all phenomena are the result of the various
movements and conglomerations of the fundamental particles of matter
called 'atoms' (literally: 'indivisible'). De Rerum Natura offers
<font color="#556b2f">mechanistic explanations for </font>phenomena
such as erosion, evaporation, wind and sound. Famous principles such

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The region of modern Eastern Europe
and Central Eurasia (<font color="#a9a9a9">Russia, Ukraine and other
countries of the former Soviet Union) </font>has a long history of
Christianity and Christian communities. Even in <font color="#dcdcdc">ancient
times, in the first centuries after the birth of Christ</font>, when
this region was called &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">Scythia&quot; </font>[by
whom?], Christians lived there. Later, the region saw the first
states to officially adopt Christianity - first in <font color="#556b2f">Armenia
</font>(<font color="#6b8e23">301 AD) </font>and <font color="#a0522d">Georgia
</font>(<font color="#228b22">337 AD)</font>, and later in the Great
Russian Principality (Kiev Rus, c. 988 AD). People of that time
referred to themselves as Christians (христиане, крестьяне)
and Russians (русские). Both terms had strong Christian
connotations.[citation needed] It is also interesting to note that
over time the term &quot;крестьяне&quot; came to mean
&quot;peasants of the Christian faith&quot; and later &quot;peasants&quot;
(the bulk of the population of the region), while the term
&quot;христиане&quot; retained its religious connotation and
the term &quot;<font color="#191970">русские&quot; </font>came
to mean representatives of a heterogeneous Russian nation based on a
common Christian faith and language,[citation needed] which strongly
influenced the history and development of the region. In the region,
the &quot;<font color="#8b0000">Pravoslaavilainen usko</font>&quot;
(Orthodox faith) or &quot;venäläinen usko&quot; (Russian faith)
became from the earliest times almost as well known as the original
&quot;kristillinen usko&quot; (Christian, Christian faith). The term
&quot;kasakka&quot; (козак, казак - a person free from the
will of God) was also used in some contexts [by whom?] to refer to
&quot;free&quot; Christians of Steppe origin who were
Russian-speaking.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 3</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">ARC was acquired in 1938 by the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Columbia Broadcasting System </font>(CBS, which
in turn had been formed from the Columbia Phonograph Company, but was
then sold off). ARC's name was changed to <font color="#2f4f4f">Columbia
Recording </font>Corporation. Columbia Phonograph Company had
international subsidiaries and <font color="#556b2f">affiliates</font>,
such as Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom, but these
were sold off before CBS bought American Columbia. <font color="#6b8e23">Ted
Wallerstein, president of RCA Victor Records, </font>convinced <font color="#a0522d">CBS
executive </font><font color="#228b22">William S. Paley </font>to buy
ARC, and Paley appointed Wallerstein to head the newly acquired
record company. The renamed company made Columbia its flagship and
Okeh its subsidiary, while ARC's other labels were downsized. Thus,
ARC's leased record labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records
were transferred to former owner Warner Bros, which sold them to
Decca Records. Columbia retained the material recorded by Brunswick
from <font color="#191970">December 1931</font>, which was reissued
on the Columbia label, and the material on the Vocalion label from
the same period, which was reissued on the Okeh label. Wallerstein,
who was promoted from president of the label to chairman at the end
of 1947, restored Columbia's position as a leading record company and
led the successful introduction of the long-playing (LP) record
before retiring as Columbia's chairman in 1951. James Conkling then
became president of Columbia Records. In 1951, Columbia also severed
its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a
distribution agreement in the UK with Philips Records, while Okeh
Records continued to be distributed by EMI on Columbia's label.</p>

imagined that this <font color="#228b22">arrangement oppresses women

that hunter-gatherer women would not understand this interpretation.
Because <font color="#191970">childcare is collective</font>, with
each baby having multiple mothers and male caregivers, the home is
not fragmented or privatized but an empowering place.[citation

brought into the camp by men. An illustrative example is Megan

Ross Sackett conducted two separate meta-analyses that empirically
tested Sahlin's view. The first of these studies looked at 102
studies on time use and the second analysed 207 studies on energy

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">On 8 December
</font>1991, in Viskul, near Brest (<font color="#dcdcdc">Belarus</font>),
the President of the Russian SFSR and the Heads of the Belarusian SSR
and the Ukrainian SSR signed the &quot;Treaty on the Establishment of
a Community of Independent States&quot; (known in the media as the
<font color="#2f4f4f">Belavezha Treaty</font>). The document, which
consisted of a preamble and <font color="#556b2f">fourteen </font>articles,
stated that the Soviet Union ceased to be a subject of international
law and geopolitical reality. However, based on the historical
community of nations, the relations between them, taking into account
bilateral agreements, the desire for a democratic rule of law, the
intention to develop their relations on the basis of mutual
recognition and respect for the sovereignty of states, the parties
agreed to form a community of independent states. On 12 December, the
<font color="#6b8e23">Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR </font>ratified
the Treaty by an overwhelming majority: 188 votes in favour, 6
against, 7 abstentions. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the
Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Establishment of the USSR
and recalled all Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the
USSR. The legality of this act is being debated, as the 1978
Constitution of the Russian SFSR (the Basic Law) did not give the
Russian Supreme Soviet the right to do so. However, the Soviet
government had by now more or less lost its capacity to act and could
not oppose it. Although the vote of 12 December is sometimes regarded
as the moment when the RSFSR broke away from the disintegrating
Soviet Union, this was not the case. It seems that the RSFSR felt
that it was not possible to break away from an entity that no longer
existed.</p>

The family home was located at 16 South Charlotte Street and has a

Bell. He had two brothers, Melville James Bell (1845-70) and Edward
Charles Bell (1848-67), who both died of <font color="#2f4f4f">tuberculosis.</font>
His father was Professor Alexander Melville Bell, a phonetician, and
his mother was Eliza Grace (née Symonds). He was born simply
&quot;Alexander Bell&quot;, but at the age of 10 he asked his father
for another name, as did his two brothers. On his 11th birthday, his
father agreed and gave him the name &quot;Graham&quot;, which he
chose to honour Alexander Graham, a Canadian whom his father had
cared for and who had become a family friend. To close relatives and
friends he remained &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Aleck</font>&quot;.</p>

specimens and </font>conduct experiments from an early age. His best
friend was <font color="#dcdcdc">Ben Herdman</font>, a neighbour
whose family ran a flour mill that was the scene of many expeditions.
Young Bell asked what the mill was for. He was told that wheat had to
be hulled by a laborious process, and at the age of 12 Bell built a
homemade device combining <font color="#556b2f">rotating paddles </font>and
a series of claw brushes, and created a simple hulling machine that
was put into service and used steadily for several years. In return,

sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry and <font color="#a9a9a9">music,
</font>encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered
<font color="#dcdcdc">the piano </font>and became the family pianist.
Although usually quiet and introverted, he enjoyed imitating and
performing 'sound tricks' resembling ventriloquism, with which he
constantly entertained family guests on their occasional visits. Bell
was also deeply impressed by his mother's gradual deafness (he began
to lose his hearing when he was12 ) and learned manual fingering so
that he could sit next to her and quietly tap out conversations that
circulated in the family living room. He also developed a technique
of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly <font color="#556b2f">into
</font>his mother's <font color="#556b2f">forehead</font>, so she
could hear him reasonably clearly. Bell's interest in his mother's

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">His family had a long association
with elocution: his grandfather Alexander Bell in London, his uncle
<font color="#a9a9a9">in Dublin </font>and his father in Edinburgh
were all elocution teachers. His father published several works on
the subject, many of which are still well known, notably his <font color="#dcdcdc">The
Standard Elocutionist </font>(1860), published in Edinburgh in 1868.
The Standard Elocutionist was published in British168 editions and
sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone.
In this thesis, Father explains his methods of teaching deaf-mutes
(as they were called at the time) to articulate words and read other
people's lip movements to interpret meaning. Bell's father taught him
and his brothers not only to write visible speech, but also to
recognise any symbol and its associated sound. Bell became so skilled
that he participated in his father's public performances and amazed
audiences with his abilities. He was able to interpret visible speech
in almost any language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic and even
Sanskrit, and could accurately pronounce written texts without
knowing their <font color="#556b2f">pronunciation.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As a young child, Bell, like her
brothers, received early education at home <font color="#a9a9a9">from
her father</font>. However, he was enrolled at an early age at the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Royal High School in </font>Edinburgh,
Scotland, which he left at the age of 15 after completing only the
first four grades. His school record was negligible, marked by
absenteeism and poor grades. His main interest was in science,
particularly <font color="#2f4f4f">biology, </font>and he was
indifferent to other subjects, to the dismay of his demanding father.
After leaving school, Bell went to London to live with his
grandfather, Alexander Bell. A love of learning was born during the
year spent with his grandfather, and Bell spent long hours in serious
discussion and study. The elder Bell worked hard to ensure that his
young pupil learned to speak clearly and persuasively, qualities that
his pupil would need to become a teacher himself. At the age of 16,
Bell got a job as an elocution and music 'pupil' at Weston House
Academy in Elgin, Moray, Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a
Latin and Greek teacher, he taught classes himself in exchange for
meals and £10 per session. The following year he studied at
Edinburgh University; he joined his elder brother Melville, who had
enrolled the previous year. In 1868, shortly before Bell left with

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">His father encouraged Bell's
interest in speech and in 1863 , took his son to see a unique
automaton, developed by <font color="#dcdcdc">Sir Charles Wheatstone
</font>based on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. The
primitive &quot;mechanical man&quot; simulated the <font color="#2f4f4f">human
voice</font>. The machine fascinated Bell, and after obtaining von
Kempelen's book, published in German, and painstakingly translating
it, he and his older brother <font color="#556b2f">Melville </font>built
their own automaton. Their father, who was very interested in their
project, offered to pay for all the supplies and encouraged the boys
by tempting them with a &quot;great prize&quot; if they succeeded.
While his brother built the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more
difficult task of creating a realistic <font color="#6b8e23">skull.</font>
His work resulted in an amazingly lifelike head that could &quot;speak&quot;,
albeit only a few words. The boys carefully adjusted the 'lips', and
as the bellows forced air through the trachea, a very recognisable
'mama' was created, to the delight of neighbours who came to see
Bell's invention.</p>

assistant master and continued to conduct sound experiments in his
spare time, using little laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on
experimenting with electricity to transmit sound and later installed
a telegraph wire from his room at <font color="#2f4f4f">Somerset
College </font>to a friend's room. Towards the end of 1867, his
health deteriorated, mainly due to exhaustion. His younger brother,
Edward &quot;Ted&quot;, suffered from tuberculosis and was similarly
bedridden. Although Bell recovered (he called himself '<font color="#6b8e23">A.G.
Bell' </font>in his correspondence) and the following year worked as
a teacher at Somerset College in Bath, England, his brother's
condition deteriorated. Edward never recovered. After his brother's
death, Bell returned home in 1867. His elder brother Melville had
married and moved away. As Bell had hoped to complete a degree at
University College London, he spent the next few years preparing for
his examinations and devoted his spare time to studying in his family

Hull's private school for <font color="#a9a9a9">the deaf </font><font color="#dcdcdc">in

dumb' girls who made considerable progress under Bell's guidance.
When his older brother seemed to succeed in many areas, including
opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent for an
invention and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. In May
1870, however, <font color="#2f4f4f">Melville </font>died of

had also suffered from a previously debilitating illness, and his

devote enough time to experimentation. While his days and evenings
were spent in his teaching and private lessons, Bell began staying up
late into the night, conducting one experiment after another in his
boarding house in rented premises. Fearful that his work would be
exposed, he made sure that his notebooks and laboratory equipment

had moved Bell to premises adjacent to the boarding house, it was

teacher and pupil would continue to work together and would also

ten years younger than Bell, but who became the object of Bell's
affection. She had lost her hearing after a near-fatal <font color="#556b2f">case
of scarlet fever </font>near her fifth birthday[N 13] and had learned

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By 1874, Bell's initial work on the
harmonic telegraph had reached a formative stage, and progress both
in his new Boston &quot;laboratory&quot; (a rented facility) and at
his family home in Canada was a great success.[14] While working that
summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a &quot;phonautograph&quot;,
a <font color="#dcdcdc">pen-like </font>device that could draw the
shapes of sound waves <font color="#556b2f">on smoked glass </font>by
tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to
produce rippling electric currents that corresponded to sound waves.
Bell also thought that a series of metal strings tuned to different
frequencies, such as a harp, could convert the rippling currents back
into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the
feasibility of these ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By 1874, telegraph traffic was
growing rapidly and, in the words of William Orton, President of
<font color="#a9a9a9">Western Union, it </font>had become &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">the
nerve centre of </font>commerce<font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;</font>.
Orton had made a deal with inventors Thomas Edison and <font color="#2f4f4f">Elisha
Gray to </font>find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each
telegraph line to avoid the high <font color="#556b2f">cost of
</font>building new lines. When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard
and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending
multiple voices over a telegraph line using a multiconductor device,
the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's
experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's patent
attorney, Anthony Pollok.</p>

visited the famous scientist <font color="#a9a9a9">Joseph Henry</font>,
then director of the Smithsonian Institution, and asked Henry for
advice on an electronic multi-channel feeding device, which Bell
hoped would transmit the human voice through a telegraph. Henry
replied that Bell had the &quot;initial impulse for a great
invention&quot;. When Bell said he did not have the necessary
information, Henry replied: &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Get it!&quot;.
</font>&quot;This statement encouraged Bell to keep trying, even
though he lacked the necessary equipment to continue his experiments
and the ability to create a working model of his ideas. But all this
was changed by a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and <font color="#2f4f4f">Thomas

that his claim to the variable resistance feature was also described
in Gray's note. Bell referred to the variable resistance device in
Bell's earlier application, in which Bell described <font color="#dcdcdc">a
mercury cup</font>, not water. Bell had filed a mercury application
with the Patent Office a year earlier on <font color="#2f4f4f">25

device. In addition, Gray waived his reservation, and since he did
not dispute Bell's priority, the examiner accepted Bell's patent on 3
March 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone,
but Bell was the first to write the idea down and the first to test
it on a telephone.</p>

scientific inventions, progress can happen simultaneously, as several
inventors who worked on the telephone will testify. The Bell
Telephone Company had to challenge its patents in court for years587
, and five patents ended up in the US Supreme Court, but none of them
succeeded in establishing priority over the original Bell patent, and
the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that went to trial.
Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were key to uncovering the

sought to invalidate the patent granted to Bell <font color="#a9a9a9">on

By the time the trial dragged on through nine years of legal
wrangling, the US Attorney had died, and two Bell patents (No.
174,465, dated March 7, 1876, and No. 186,787, dated January 30,
1877) were no longer valid, although the presiding justices agreed to
continue the trial because the case was an important &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">precedent</font>.&quot;

Italian inventor <font color="#a9a9a9">Antonio Meucci </font>also
claimed to have created the first working telephone model in Italy in
3184. In 1886, in the first of three trials in which he participated,
Meucci appeared as a witness hoping to prove the privilege of his
invention. Meucci's evidence was challenged in this case because
there was no physical evidence of his invention, as his working
models were alleged to have disappeared from the laboratory of the
<font color="#2f4f4f">American District Telegraph (ADT) in </font>New
York, later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in <font color="#556b2f">1901.
</font>Meucci's work, like that of many other inventors of the era,
was based on earlier acoustic principles, and despite evidence of
earlier experiments, the final case against Meucci was eventually
dismissed <font color="#6b8e23">after </font>Meucci's <font color="#6b8e23">death.</font>
However, thanks to the efforts of Congressman Vito Fossella, the US
House of Representatives ruled on 11 June 2002 that Meucci's &quot;work

recognised throughout the world, and patent applications were filed
in most major countries, but after Bell delayed a German patent
application, the electronics company Siemens &amp; Halske (S&amp;H)
managed to establish a competing manufacturer for Bell's phones with
its own patent. Siemens produced almost identical copies of Bell's
phones without having to pay <font color="#a9a9a9">royalties</font>.
The establishment of the international Bell Telephone Company <font color="#dcdcdc">in
Brussels</font>, Belgium in <font color="#2f4f4f">1880, </font>and a

Hubbard </font>(1857-1923) at the Hubbard Mansion in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. As a wedding gift to his bride, he gave her 1 487 of
the 1 497 shares of newly formed Bell Telephone Company stock.
Shortly afterwards, the newlyweds embarked on a year-long honeymoon
<font color="#2f4f4f">in Europe</font>. For this trip, Bell took a
handmade model of his telephone with him, making the trip a 'working
holiday'. The affair had begun years earlier, but Bell waited until
she was financially secure before getting married. Although the
telephone appeared to be an 'immediate' success, it was not initially
a profitable venture, and Bell's main source of income came from
<font color="#556b2f">lecturing </font>only after 1897. One unusual
request made by the bride was that Bell should use the name 'Alec'
rather than the family's previously familiar name 'Aleck'. From 1876
onwards, he spelled his name 'Alec Bell'. They had four children:</p>

When Bell returned in 1886, he began building a mansion on the
peninsula opposite Baddeck, overlooking Lake<font color="#dcdcdc">

Bell and his family sailed or rowed several vessels on Lake Bras d'Or
and ordered more from H.W. Embree and Sons boatyard in Port

most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his
interests were very diverse. According to one of his biographers,
Charlotte Gray, Bell worked &quot;in an infinite variety of
disciplines&quot;, and he often went to bed voraciously reading <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Encyclopædia Britannica in </font>search of new interests. The
extent of Bell's inventive genius is only partly illustrated by the
patents granted in his name18 and those he <font color="#2f4f4f">shared
</font>with his collaborators. There were 14 for telephones and
telegraphs, four for photophones, one for phonographs, five for
aircraft, four for &quot;seaplanes&quot; and two for selenium cells.
Bell's inventions covered a wide range of interests, including a
metal jacket to facilitate breathing, an audiometer to detect minor
hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, studies to extract
salt from seawater and work to find alternative fuels.</p>

for the Advancement of <font color="#a9a9a9">Science </font>in 1882,
differs in several details from most of the many and varied versions
in circulation today, in particular it concludes that the failure to
locate the bullet was not due to a foreign metal. Perplexed by the
extraordinary results of Garfield's investigation, Bell &quot;...went
to <font color="#dcdcdc">the Executive Mansion the </font>next
morning... to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were
absolutely certain that all metal had been removed from the vicinity
of the bed. Then it occurred to me that under the horsehair mattress
on which the President was lying was another mattress made of steel
wire. When a duplicate of the mattress was obtained, it was found to
consist of a kind of net woven from steel wires with large eyes.
Since the area [of the detector response] was so small compared to
the surface area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that
the steel mattress had no adverse effect.&quot;.&quot; <font color="#556b2f">In
a footnote, </font>Bell adds that &quot;President Garfield's death

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In a March 1906 Scientific <font color="#a9a9a9">American
</font>article, American pioneer <font color="#dcdcdc">William E.
Meacham </font>explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and water
levels. Bell considered the invention of the water plane to be a very
significant achievement. On the basis of the information from that
article, he began to sketch out the concepts of what is now called
<font color="#2f4f4f">the hydrofoil boat. </font>Bell and his
assistant <font color="#556b2f">Frederick W. &quot;Casey&quot;
Baldwin </font>began experiments with the hydrofoil in the summer of
1908 as a possible aid in getting an aircraft off the water. Baldwin
studied the work of Italian inventor <font color="#6b8e23">Enrico
Forlanini </font>and began testing models. This led him and Bell to
develop practical hydrofoils.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1910-11, Bell and Baldwin met
Forlanin <font color="#a9a9a9">in France </font>during his world
tour. They sailed on Forlanin's hydrofoil across Lake Maggiore.
Baldwin described it as as smooth as <font color="#dcdcdc">flying</font>.
On their return to Baddeck, several preliminary concepts were built
as experimental designs, including Dhonnas Beag, the first
Bell-Baldwin self-propelled hydrofoil. The experimental craft were
essentially concept prototypes, culminating in the more substantial
<font color="#2f4f4f">HD-4 model, </font>powered by Renault engines.
With a top speed of 54 miles per hour (87 km/h), the hydrofoil had
rapid acceleration, good stability and steering, and the ability to
negotiate waves without difficulty. In 1913, Dr Bell hired Walter
Pinaud, a Sydney-based yacht designer and builder and owner of
Pinaud's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia, to work on the HD-4's
pontoons. Pinaud soon took over Bell Laboratories' shipyard at Beinn
Bhreagh, Bell's mansion near Baddeck, Nova Scotia. Pinaud's
experience in boatbuilding allowed him to make useful changes to the
HD-4's design. After the First World War, work on the HD-4 resumed.
Thanks to Bell's report to the US Navy, he was able to acquire two
350 horsepower (260 kilowatt) engines in July 1919. On 9 September
1919, HD-4 set a world record for seagoing speed of 70.86 miles per
hour (114.04 kilometres per hour), which stood for ten years.</p>

heavier-than-air aircraft by applying knowledge of kites <font color="#a9a9a9">to

designed and built the Red Wing, framed in <font color="#dcdcdc">bamboo
</font>and covered in red silk, powered by a small air-cooled engine.
On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the <font color="#2f4f4f">biplane
</font>took to the skies for the first public flight in North
America.[N 24] [N 25] Innovations incorporated into this design
included a cockpit enclosure and tail fin (later variations of the

a practical wingtip shape, became standard equipment on all aircraft
[N 26] The White Wing and June Bug followed, and by the end of 1908
more than <font color="#556b2f">150-air </font>crashes had been
flown. However, the AEA's initial reserves had been exhausted, and
only a grant of $15,000 from Mrs Bell allowed the experiments to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Bell was in contact with the
eugenics movement in the United States. In his lecture Memoir upon
the formation of a deaf variety of the human race, presented to the
National Academy of Sciences on 13 November 1883, he noted that
<font color="#a9a9a9">congenitally deaf parents </font>were more
likely to give birth to deaf children, and tentatively suggested that
couples where both partners were deaf should not marry. However, his
<font color="#dcdcdc">interest in cattle breeding </font>led to his
appointment by biologist <font color="#2f4f4f">David Starr </font>Jordan
to the Eugenics Committee of the American Cattlemen's Association.
The Committee explicitly extended the principle to humans. From 1912
to 1918, he was chairman of the Board of Scientific Advisers of the
Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York,
and regularly attended its meetings. In 1921 he was Honorary
President of the <font color="#556b2f">Second International Eugenics
Congress, </font>held under the auspices of the American Museum of
Natural History in New York. Such organisations advocated the
enactment of laws (successfully in some states) providing for the
forced sterilisation of people who were considered by Bell to be
'defective varieties of the human race'. By the late 1930s, about
half of the US states had eugenics laws, and California's forced
sterilisation law was used as a model for Nazi Germany.</p>

Prize of 50,000 francs (about <font color="#a9a9a9">$250,000 </font>in
today's dollars) by the Académie française, the French government's

The </font>Volta Prize was created by <font color="#2f4f4f">Napoleon
Bonaparte in </font>1801 and named in honour of Alessandro Volta, and
Bell was awarded the third top prize in the history of the prize. As
Bell was becoming increasingly wealthy, he used his prize money to
establish endowment funds (the Volta Fund) and institutions in and
around Washington, the US capital. These included the prestigious
&quot;Volta Laboratory Association&quot; (1880), also known as the
Volta Laboratory and the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, which
eventually led to <font color="#556b2f">the Volta Bureau </font>(1887),
a centre for deaf research that still operates in Georgetown,
Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility
dedicated to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved
Edison's phonograph by replacing the foil used as a recording medium
<font color="#6b8e23">with wax </font>and by incising the recording
instead of recessing it, key improvements later adopted by Edison
himself. The laboratory was also the place where he and his
colleagues invented their 'proudest achievement', the 'photophone',
the 'optical telephone' that anticipated fibre-optic
telecommunications, and the Volta Bureau later evolved into the
Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing
(AG Bell), a leading centre for deaf research and education.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The inhabitants of the British Isles
have been drinking beer since <font color="#a9a9a9">the Bronze Age</font>,
but it was only with the arrival of the Roman Empire on its shores in
the <font color="#dcdcdc">1st century </font>and the construction of
the Roman road networks that the first inns, <font color="#2f4f4f">called
tabernae, </font>began to appear<font color="#2f4f4f">, where
</font>travellers could get refreshments. After the end of Roman rule
<font color="#556b2f">in the 5th century </font>and the break-up of
the Romano-British kingdoms, Anglo-Saxons set up inns in their
households, and the Anglo-Saxon beer woman put up a <font color="#6b8e23">green
</font>bush on a pole to let people know that her beer was ready.
These beer houses quickly evolved into meeting houses where people
could socialise, gossip and organise mutual aid in their communities.
This is the origin of the modern pub, or 'pub' as it is called in
England. Pubs quickly spread across the kingdom, becoming so common
that in 965 King Edgar decreed that there could be no more than one
alehouse in a village.</p>

any formal distinction between inns and other guesthouses. Many pubs
use the word 'Inn' in their name, either because they are

the evangelical church and temperance movements of the time

licence from a local magistrate. Additional provisions regulated
gambling, drunkenness, prostitution and undesirable behaviour in
licensed premises, and could be enforced by prosecution or, more
effectively, by threatening the landlord with the loss of his
licence. Licences were granted, transferred or renewed only in <font color="#dcdcdc">a

officers after leaving the service. The conditions of the licence
varied greatly according to local practice. They set out the
permitted opening hours, which might require Sunday closure or allow
all-night opening in the vicinity of the market. Typically, they
could require opening for the full permitted hours and the provision
of food or toilets. Once a permit was obtained, licensees jealously
guarded it (licensees were usually expected to be present, not the

permits</font>&quot; to serve drinks in temporary spaces, such as at

that the pub owner allows drinkers to stay in the pub after legal
closing time on the basis that once the doors are locked, the pub
becomes a private party rather than a pub. Customers can put money
behind the bar before the official closing time and redeem their
drinks during the unlocking period, so technically drinks are not
sold after closing time. The British lock-in was originally a
reaction to amendments to the English and Welsh licensing laws of
1915, which restricted opening hours to prevent factory workers from
turning up drunk and interfering with the war effort. Since 1915, UK
licensing laws had changed very little and the closing time was
relatively early. The tradition of lock-in was therefore preserved.
Since the <font color="#2f4f4f">Licensing Act 2003 </font>came into
force, premises in England and Wales can apply to extend their
opening hours beyond 11pm, allowing drinking 24 hours a day and
largely removing the need for lock-in times. After the smoking ban

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 1700s, a new room was
created in the pub: the saloon. In the late 1700s, pubs had always
provided some form of entertainment - singing, gambling or sport.
<font color="#dcdcdc">Balls Pond Road </font>in Islington was named
after a restaurant run by a Mr Ball, which had a duck pond at the
back where, for a fee, drinkers could go out and shoot ducks. More
common, however, was a card room or billiard room. A saloon was a
room where, for an admission fee or a higher price for a drink, a
song, dance, drama or comedy was performed and drinks were served at
a table. this gave rise to the popular entertainment form of the
music hall - a show consisting of a variety of performances. The most
famous London saloon was the Grecian saloon at <font color="#2f4f4f">The
Eagle </font><font color="#556b2f">on the City Road</font>, still
famous for its nursery rhyme: 'Up and down the City Road / In and out
The Eagle / That's the way the money goes / Pop goes the <font color="#6b8e23">weasel</font>'.
This meant that the customer had spent all his money at The Eagle and
had to pawn the 'weasel' to get more. The meaning of &quot;weasel&quot;
is unclear, but the two most likely definitions are: a flat iron used
to finish clothes, or rhyming slang for a coat (weasel and stoat).</p>

that customers could choose between affordability and exclusivity (or

between a saloon and a public bar was often seen as old-fashioned,

the names saloon and pub bar, prices (and often furniture and decor)
are the same in all premises, and many pubs now have one large room.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">It was a pub that first introduced
the concept of using the bar counter to serve beer. Until then, in
beer bars, <font color="#a9a9a9">beer was brought to the tables </font>or
benches, as is still the case in beer gardens and other drinking
places in Germany. There might be a counter table at the bar where
the manager could do paperwork while keeping an eye on the customers,
but the beer kegs were kept in a separate <font color="#dcdcdc">dispensing
room. </font>When the first pubs were built, the main room was a
public room with a large serving counter, copied <font color="#2f4f4f">from
gin houses, designed to </font>serve as many people as possible in as
little time as possible. It became known as the public bar[citation
needed]. Other, more private rooms did not have a serving counter,
but had beer brought to them from the public bar. There are several
pubs in the Midlands and the North that still retain this system, but
nowadays the customer picks up the beer from the taproom or public
bar themselves. One of these is The Vine, known locally as <font color="#556b2f">The
Bull and Bladder</font>, <font color="#6b8e23">in Brierley Hill </font>near
Birmingham, and another is the Cock at Broom in Bedfordshire, a
series of small rooms where waiters serve drinks and food. In the
Manchester area, the public bar was known as the 'vault', and other
spaces were lounge and snug as elsewhere. By the early 1970s there
was a move towards one large drinks room, and brewers invested
heavily in decor and theming.</p>

pubs became tied pubs, which could only sell beer from one brewery (a

owned by the brewery, but was rented to an individual (the <font color="#2f4f4f">landlord)
</font>who ran it as a separate business (although he was obliged to
buy beer from the brewer). Another very common arrangement was (and
still is) that the landlord owned the premises (whether freehold or

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Towards the end of the 20th century,
breweries started to manage their pubs directly, using restaurant
managers instead of tenants. Most such brewers, such as the regional
brewery <font color="#a9a9a9">Shepherd Neame </font>in Kent and
<font color="#dcdcdc">Young's and Fuller's </font>in London, control
hundreds of pubs in a particular area of the UK, while a few, such as
<font color="#2f4f4f">Greene King, </font>operate nationwide. The
landlord of a tied pub may be an employee of the brewer, in which
case he is the manager of the managed pub, or a self-employed tenant
who has entered into a lease agreement with the brewer, which is
conditional on a legal obligation (a commercial contract) to purchase
only beer from that brewer. The range of beers is limited mainly to
those brewed by the brewer. The <font color="#556b2f">Beer
Regulations of </font>1989 , were intended to require tied houses to
offer at least one alternative beer, known as a 'guest beer', from
another brewery. This law has now been repealed, but while it was in
force it changed the industry dramatically. Some pubs still have a

The legislation stated that &quot;anyone brewing beer in the town

will <font color="#2f4f4f">lose his beer</font>&quot;. This was so
that passing <font color="#556b2f">inspectors</font>, borough ale

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Another important factor was that <font color="#a9a9a9">in
the Middle Ages a </font>large part of the population was illiterate,
so the images on the sign were more useful than the words in
identifying the pub. For this reason, there was often no reason to
write the name of the inn on the sign, and inns were opened without a
formal written name, the name being derived later <font color="#dcdcdc">from
the image on the pub sign</font>.</p>

equipment, hung above the pub door. In some cases, local nicknames,
<font color="#dcdcdc">agricultural </font>terms and puns were used.
Local events were often commemorated on pub signs. Simple natural or
religious symbols such as 'sun', 'star' and '<font color="#2f4f4f">cross'
were </font>incorporated into pub signs, and sometimes modified to
include elements of local heraldry (e.g. <font color="#556b2f">the

land on which the pub was located. Some pubs have inscriptions in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On 23 April 2014, the US Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) was reported to be considering a new
rule that would allow <font color="#a9a9a9">internet service
providers to offer content providers a faster route to deliver
content, </font>reversing their previous position on net neutrality.
According to <font color="#2f4f4f">Susan Crawford, </font>a law and
technology expert at Harvard Law School, a possible solution to net
neutrality concerns could be <font color="#dcdcdc">municipal
broadband</font>. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two
options for Internet services: first, allowing fast and slow
broadband, which would compromise net neutrality, and second,
reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service, which would
preserve net neutrality. On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama
recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service <font color="#556b2f">as
a telecommunications service to </font>preserve net neutrality. On
January 16, 2015, Republicans introduced legislation <font color="#a0522d">in
the form of an H.R. debate bill in the U.S. Congress that would </font>make
concessions on net neutrality, but prohibit the FCC from achieving
the goal or enacting additional regulation affecting ISPs. On January
31, 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will propose the idea of
applying <font color="#228b22">Title II of the </font>Communications
Act of 1934 <font color="#228b22">(common carrier) </font>to the
Internet (&quot;with certain reservations&quot;) in a vote expected
on February 26, 2015. Adoption of this idea would reclassify Internet
service from an information service to a telecommunications service
and would ensure net neutrality, according to FCC Chairman Tom
Wheeler. According to the New York Times, the FCC is expected to
enforce <font color="#191970">net neutrality </font>in its vote.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Cartoons are a medium used to
express ideas through images, often combined with text or other
visual information. Cartoons are often a parallel series of panels of
images. Often textual media, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">speech
balloons</font>, captions and onomatopoeias, express dialogue,
narration, sound effects or other information. The size and placement
of the panels contribute to the <font color="#dcdcdc">pace of the
narrative</font>. The cartoon and similar forms of illustration are
the most common means of image creation in comics; <font color="#2f4f4f">fumetti
</font>is a form that uses photographs. Since the late 20th century,
bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums and tankōbo have
become more common, and the 21st century has seen an increase in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The history of comics has followed
different paths in different cultures. Scholars have traced its
prehistory as far back as Lascaux's cave paintings. By the mid-20th
century, comics were flourishing, particularly in the United States,
Western Europe (especially France and Belgium) and Japan. The history
of the European comic strip often goes back to the comic book
supplements published by Rodolphe Töpffer <font color="#a9a9a9">in
the 1830s</font>, and became popular in the 1930s with the success of
comic strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American
comics became a mass medium in the early 20th century with newspaper
comics, followed in the 1930s by magazine comics, where the superhero
genre took off with the appearance of <font color="#dcdcdc">Superman
in </font>1938. In the history of Japanese comics and comic book
drawing (<font color="#2f4f4f">manga</font>), it has been suggested
that comics originated as early as the 13th century. Modern comics
emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the production of
comic magazines and books grew rapidly in the post-World War II
period with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka.
Comics have had a modest reputation for most of their history, but
towards the end of the 20th century they began to gain more
acceptance among the public and academics.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The English term comics is used in
the singular <font color="#a9a9a9">when referring to a medium and in
</font>the plural when referring to individual instances, such as
individual strips or comic books. Although the term has its origins
in the humorous (or comic) works that dominated early American
newspaper comics, it has also become established for non-humorous
works. In English, it is common to refer to comics from different
cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as <font color="#dcdcdc">manga
</font>for Japanese comics or <font color="#2f4f4f">bandes dessinées
</font>for French comics. Theorists and historians do not agree on
the definition of comics; some emphasise the combination of <font color="#556b2f">images
and text</font>, some on serialism or other image relationships, and
some on historical aspects such as mass production or the <font color="#6b8e23">use
of recurring characters.</font> The increasing cross-fertilisation of
concepts from different comic book cultures and periods has further
complicated the definition.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The European, American and Japanese
comic traditions have followed different paths. Europeans have seen
their tradition as beginning with the Swiss <font color="#a9a9a9">Rodolphe
Töpffer as early as </font>1827, while Americans have seen theirs as
beginning with <font color="#dcdcdc">Richard F. Outcault'</font>s
<font color="#2f4f4f">1890s </font>newspaper cartoon The Yellow Kid,
although many Americans have begun to acknowledge Töpffer's lead.
Japan has a long history of <font color="#556b2f">satirical </font>cartoons
and comics, dating back to the Second World War. In the early 19th
century, Ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularised the concept of the
Japanese comic strip and cartoon, the manga. In the post-war period,
modern Japanese comics began to flourish, with Osamu Tezuka's
prolific output. Towards the end of the 20th century, the three
traditions merged and evolved towards the literary comic: the comic
album in Europe, tankōbon[a] in Japan and the graphic novel in
English-speaking countries.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The popularity of superhero comics
declined after the Second World War, while sales of comics continued
to grow as other comic genres such as romance, westerns, crime,
horror and humour increased. As sales peaked in the early 1950s, the
content of comic books (especially <font color="#a9a9a9">crime and

government agencies, culminating in the Senate hearings that led to
the creation of <font color="#dcdcdc">the Comics Code Authority</font>.
The Code has been accused of stunting the growth of American comics
and maintaining its low status in American society for most of the
rest of the century. By the early <font color="#2f4f4f">1960s,
</font>superheroes had re-established themselves as a major comic
genre. Underground comics challenged the code and readers with adult,
counter-cultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s. <font color="#556b2f">In

to focus either on its recent history, post-World War II, or on
attempts to trace deep roots in the past, such as the
Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga scroll of the 13th and 13th centuries or the
Hokusai Manga of the early 19th century. The first historical survey
of Japanese comics was Seiki Hosokibara's <font color="#a9a9a9">Nihon
Manga-Shi</font>[i] in 1924. Early post-war Japanese criticism was
mostly left-wing political until the 1986 publication of Tomofusa
Kure's Modern Manga: The Complete Picture,[j] which emphasised
politics over formal aspects such as structure and the &quot;grammar&quot;
of comics. The field of manga studies grew rapidly, with numerous
books on the subject appearing in the 1990s. Formal theories of manga
have focused on developing a &quot;theory of manga expression&quot;[k],
which emphasises spatial relationships in the structure of the images
on the page and distinguishes this medium from film or literature,
where the passage of time is the basic organising element. Courses in
cartoon studies have proliferated in Japanese universities, and the
<font color="#2f4f4f">Japan Society for Studies in Cartoon and Comics
</font>(ja)[l] was founded in 2001 to promote cartoon studies.

</font>attempted the first comprehensive history of American comics
in <font color="#dcdcdc">The Comics </font>(1947), while Will
Eisner's <font color="#2f4f4f">Comics and Sequential Art </font>(1985)
and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts
to formalize comics studies in English. <font color="#556b2f">David
</font>Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first
full-length philosophical treatment of comics. Notable American
attempts to define comics include Eisner's, McCloud's and Harvey's.
Eisner described what he called 'sequential art' as 'the arrangement
of pictures or pictures and words to tell a story or dramatise an
idea'; Scott McCloud defined comics as 'the juxtaposition of pictures
and other images in a deliberate sequence, intended to convey
information and/or to evoke an aesthetic response in the viewer', a
strictly formal definition that detaches comics from its historical
and cultural characteristics. R. C. Harvey defined comics as
&quot;pictorial narratives or commentaries in which the words (often
written on the image within the speech balloons) usually contribute
to the meaning of the images and vice versa&quot;. Each definition
has had its opponents. Harvey considered McCloud's definition to
exclude single-panel comics, and objected to McCloud's lack of
emphasis on verbal elements, arguing that 'the essential feature of
the comic is the inclusion of verbal content'. Aaron Meskin saw
McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimise the role of
the comic in art history.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">European cartoon studies began with
Töpffer's theories of the 1840s<font color="#a9a9a9">, which
</font>emphasised panel transitions and the combination of the visual
and the verbal. No further progress was made before the 1970s. <font color="#dcdcdc">Pierre
Fresnault-Deruelle </font>then introduced a semiotic approach to the
study of comics by analysing text-image relations, lateral image
relations and image discontinuity, what Scott McCloud later called
'enclosure'. In 1987, <font color="#2f4f4f">Henri Vanlier </font>introduced
the term multicadre, or 'multiframe', to refer to the comic as a
semantic unit on the page. In the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît
Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned their attention to the poetic
creative choices of artists. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have
put forward relativist views on the definition of the comic strip, as
the comic strip medium has taken different, equally valid forms
throughout its history. Morgan considers comics to be a subcategory
of &quot;les littératures dessinées&quot; (i.e. &quot;drawn
literatures&quot;). French theory has begun to pay particular
attention to the page as distinct from American theories, such as
McCloud's, which focus on transitions between panels. Since the
mid-2000s, <font color="#556b2f">Neil Cohn </font>has begun to
analyse the understanding of comics through cognitive science,
extending the theory using psychological and neuroscientific
experiments. This work has argued that there are distinct rule-bound
'grammars' for understanding sequential images and page layouts that
go beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions
between layout types, and that the brain understands comics in the
same way as other domains such as language and music.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to most historical
accounts, the island was discovered on <font color="#a9a9a9">21 May
1502 </font>by the Galician navigator <font color="#dcdcdc">João da
Nova, </font>sailing for <font color="#2f4f4f">Portugal, who </font>named
it Santa Helena after <font color="#556b2f">Helena of Constantinople</font>.
According to another theory, the island discovered by da Nova was in
fact Tristan da Cunha, 2 430 km to the south, and that Saint Helena
was discovered by some ships belonging to the Estêvão da Gama
expedition on 30 July 1503 (as reported by the scribe Thomé Lopes).
However, an article published in 2015 revised the date of the
discovery and dismissed 18 August as too late for da Nova to have
made the discovery and returned to Lisbon by 11 September 1502,
whether he sailed from St Helena or Tristan da Cunha. It shows that
21 May is probably a Protestant rather than a Catholic or Orthodox
feast day, and was first mentioned in 1596 by Jan Huyghen van
Linschoten, who was probably mistaken, as the island was discovered
several decades before the Reformation and the beginning of
Protestantism. The alternative discovery date of 3 May, mentioned by
Odoardo Duarte Lopes and Sir Thomas Herbert, which is the Catholic
feast day of the real cross found by St Helena in Jerusalem, is
considered more historically plausible.</p>

islands in the South Atlantic, which are also British territories:
the island of Ascension, located some 1 300 km north-west in
equatorial waters, and Tristan da Cunha, far out in the tropics, 2
430 km to the south. The island is in the <font color="#556b2f">western

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The island of Saint Helena covers a
total area of 122 <font color="#a9a9a9">47 square kilometres </font>and
is largely made up of rugged terrain of <font color="#dcdcdc">volcanic
</font>origin (the last volcanic eruptions occurred around 7 million
years ago). The coastal areas are covered with volcanic rock and are
warmer and drier than the centre. The highest point on the island is
Diana's Peak at 818 m (2<font color="#2f4f4f">,684 </font>ft). In
<font color="#556b2f">1996 </font>it <font color="#556b2f">became the
</font>island's first national park. Much of the island is covered in
New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are also
some native trees that have been replanted, including in <font color="#6b8e23">the
Millennium Forest project, which was </font>established in 2002 to
replant part of the lost Great Wood forest and is now managed by the
Saint Helena National Trust. When the island was discovered, it was
covered in unique native vegetation, including a significant cabbage
tree species. The interior of the island must have been dense
tropical forest, but the coastal areas were probably also quite
green. The present landscape is very different, with largely bare
rock in the lowlands, while the interior is green, mainly due to
introduced vegetation. There are no native terrestrial mammals, but
cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep
have been introduced, which has adversely affected the native
species. The dramatic change in the landscape is due to these
newcomers. As a result, the bow tree (Acalypha rubrinervis) and the
Saint Helena olive (Nesiota elliptica) are now extinct, and many
other endemic plants are threatened with extinction.</p>

Because hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most

charged (i.e. cation), known as H+. The hydrogen cation is written as

suggests. As the hydrogen atom is the only neutral atom for which the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The space race in the 20th century
was a competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union
(USSR) and the United States (USA), for supremacy of space flight
capacity. It originated in the post-World War II missile-based
nuclear arms race between the two countries, made possible by the
missile technology and personnel that Germany had acquired. The
technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as
necessary for national security and a symbol of ideological
superiority. The space race spawned pioneering efforts to launch
artificial satellites, unmanned space probes to the Moon, Venus and
Mars, and human spaceflights to low Earth orbit and the Moon. The
competition began <font color="#a9a9a9">on 2 August 1955</font>, when
the Soviet Union responded to a US announcement four days earlier
that it intended to launch artificial satellites for the
International Geophysical Year by announcing that it would also
launch a satellite 'in the near future'. The Soviet Union beat the
United States to the launch of Sputnik 1 on <font color="#dcdcdc">4
October 1957, </font>and later beat the United States to the launch
of <font color="#2f4f4f">Yuri Gagarin on </font><font color="#556b2f">12
April </font>1961. The space race reached its peak when the United
States landed the first humans on the Moon on 20 July 1969 on Apollo
11. The Soviet Union attempted manned missions to the Moon, but
failed, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on space
stations in Earth orbit. There followed a period of conciliation,
with the agreement in April 1972 to cooperate on the Apollo-Soyuz
experimental project, which resulted in a rendezvous between US
astronaut and Soviet cosmonaut personnel in Earth orbit in July 1975.</p>

the 1930s and continued during the <font color="#a9a9a9">Second World
War </font>as Nazi Germany researched and built working ballistic
missiles. In the late 1930s, in the late Weimar Republic, German
aeronautical engineers experimented with liquid-fuelled rockets, with
the aim of one day reaching high altitudes and long distances.
Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker, head of the German Army's
Ballistics and Munitions Department, assembled a small team of
engineers, including Walter Dornberger and Leo Zanssen, to work out
how rockets could be used as long-range artillery to circumvent the
Versailles Treaty's ban on research and development of long-range
guns. Becker and Dornberger recruited the young engineering prodigy
Wernher von Braun to join the secret army programme at
Kummersdorf-West in <font color="#dcdcdc">1932.</font> Von Braun
dreamed of conquering space with rockets and did not initially see
the military value of missile technology.</p>

the first vehicle to enter space during its test flight programme in
<font color="#2f4f4f">1942 and 1943</font>. By 1943, Germany began
mass production of the A-4 as the Vergeltungswaffe 2 (&quot;revenge
weapon&quot; 2, or more commonly V2), a ballistic missile with a
range of 320 kilometers that carried a 1,130-kilogram warhead at
4,000 kilometers per hour. Its supersonic speed meant that there was
no defence against it, and radar detection gave little warning.
Germany bombed southern England and parts of liberated western Europe
from 1944 to 1945. After the war, the V-2 became the basis of
American and Soviet missile plans.</p>

the Soviet authorities transferred most of the captured German rocket
experts to Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger, some 240 kilometres
north-west of Moscow. They were not allowed to participate in Soviet
missile design, but were used as problem-solving consultants for
Soviet engineers. They helped in the following areas: the creation of
a Soviet version of the A-4, working on 'organisation charts',
research to improve the main engine of the A-4, development of a
100-ton engine, assistance with the 'layout' of the factory
production facilities and preparation of the rocket assembly using
German components. With their help, in particular that of Helmut
Groettrup's team, Korolev redesigned the A-4 and built his own
version of the rocket, the R-1, in 1948. He later developed his own
separate designs, although many of these were inspired by the
Groettrup group's G4-R10 of 1949. The Germans were finally
repatriated in 1951-53.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Put simply, the Cold War can be seen
as a manifestation of the ideological struggle between communism and
capitalism. The United States faced a new uncertainty from September
1949, when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb. The American
intelligence services discovered that the Soviet Union had detonated
its first atomic bomb, with the result that the United States might
in future be faced with a possible nuclear war that could, for the
first time, destroy its cities. Faced with this new threat, the
United States entered into an arms race with the Soviet Union, which
included the development of <font color="#dcdcdc">a hydrogen bomb </font>and
the development of inter<font color="#2f4f4f">continental strategic
bombers and </font>intercontinental ballistic <font color="#2f4f4f">missiles
</font>(ICBMs) capable of delivering nuclear weapons. A new fear of
communism and its adherents took hold of the United States <font color="#556b2f">in
the 1950s, and it </font>became a paranoid McCarthyism. As communism
spread in China, Korea and Eastern Europe, Americans felt so
threatened that popular and political culture tolerated large-scale
'witch-hunts' to expose communist spies. One response to Soviet
atomic and hydrogen bomb tests was to maintain control of the large
air forces under the control of <font color="#6b8e23">the </font>Strategic
Air Command (SAC). The SAC operated intercontinental strategic
bombers and medium bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads
stationed near Soviet airspace (Western Europe and Turkey).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Originally, President Eisenhower was
concerned that a satellite passing over a country at an altitude of
more than 100 kilometres might be interpreted as a violation of that
country's sovereign airspace. He feared that the Soviet Union would
accuse the Americans of illegal overflight and thus gain a propaganda
victory at his expense. Eisenhower and his advisers believed that the
sovereignty of a nation's airspace did not extend into outer space,
known as the Kármán Line, and he used the launches of the
International Geophysical Year 1957-58 to establish this principle in
international law. Eisenhower also feared that he might cause an
international incident and be called a 'warmonger' if he used
military missiles as launchers. He therefore chose the untested Naval
Research Laboratory Vanguard rocket, a research-only launcher. This
meant that von Braun's team was not allowed to place a satellite into
orbit on its Jupiter-C rocket, as it was to be used in the future as
a military launcher. On <font color="#a9a9a9">20 September </font>1956,
von Braun and his team launched the Jupiter-C rocket, which was able
to place the satellite in orbit, but the launch was only used as a
sub-orbital test of the nose cone recovery technique.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Soviet success caused public
controversy in the United States, and Eisenhower ordered the civilian
rocket and satellite project, <font color="#a9a9a9">Vanguard, </font>to
bring forward its schedule and launch its satellites much earlier
than originally planned. The Vanguard launch failed on <font color="#dcdcdc">6
December </font>1957 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station <font color="#2f4f4f">in
Florida and was </font>broadcast live to a US television audience. It
was a huge failure, exploding seconds after launch and becoming an
international joke. The satellite appeared in newspapers under the
names Flopnik, Stayputnik, Kaputnik and Dudnik. At the United
Nations, the Russian representative offered the US representative
assistance 'under the Soviet technical assistance programme for
backward nations'. Only after this very public failure was von
Braun's Redstone team given the go-ahead to launch <font color="#556b2f">their
Jupiter-C rocket as </font>soon as possible. In Britain, the US's
western Cold War ally, the reaction was mixed: some people celebrated
the fact that the Soviet Union had been the first to go into space,
while others feared the disastrous possibilities of military use of
spacecraft.</p>

</font>1958, almost four months after the launch of Sputnik 1, von
Braun and the United States successfully launched their first
satellite at Cape Canaveral using a four-stage Juno I rocket from the
US military's Redstone missile. The Explorer 1 satellite weighed 14.0
kilograms (30.8 pounds). It was equipped with a micrometeorometer and
a Geiger-Müller tube. It travelled in a 194 x 1368 nautical mile
(360 x 2534 km) orbit in and out of the radiation belt around the
Earth, saturating the tube's capacity and proving what Dr James Van
Allen, a space scientist at the University of Iowa, had theorised.
The Van Allen radiation belt, called the Van Allen Radiation Belt, is
a donut-shaped region of very intense radiation around the Earth
above the magnetic equator. Van Allen was also the man who designed
and built the Explorer 1 satellite instrument array. The satellite
actually measured three phenomena: <font color="#dcdcdc">cosmic rays
and radiation levels, the temperature of the spacecraft and the
collision density with micrometeorites.</font> The satellite had no
memory to store the data, so it had to transmit continuously. Two
months later, in March 1958, a second satellite was sent into orbit
with extended cosmic-ray instruments.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By 1959, American observers believed
that the Soviet Union would be the first to put a man in space,
because it took time for Mercury's first launch. On 12 April 1961,
<font color="#a9a9a9">the Soviet Union </font>surprised the world
again by launching Yuri Gagarin's <font color="#dcdcdc">Vostok 1 </font>into
Earth orbit. Gagarin was called the first cosmonaut, which roughly
translates from Russian and Greek as 'sailor of the universe'.
Although Gagarin was able to manually take control of his spacecraft
in an emergency by opening an envelope in the cabin containing a code
to be entered into a computer, it was flown in automatic mode as a
precaution; medical science at the time did not know what would
happen to a human being in the weightlessness of space. Vostok 1
orbited the Earth for <font color="#2f4f4f">108 minutes </font>and
landed above the Soviet Union. Gagarin disembarked at an altitude of
7 000 metres and parachuted down. The International Aeronautical
Federation (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale) considered
Gagarin to have made the world's first human space flight, even
though its aeronautical record rules at the time required pilots to
take off and land with their spacecraft. For this reason, the Soviet
Union omitted from the FAI announcement that Gagarin did not land
with his capsule. When the FAI declaration of German Titov's second
Vostok flight in August 1961 revealed the ejection landing technique,
the FAI committee decided to investigate and concluded that the
technological achievement of human space flight lay in the safe
launch, orbit and re-entry rather than the landing method, and
revised its rules accordingly, leaving Gagarin's and Titov's records
intact.</p>

space programme at the time made possible other major achievements of
its space programme, such as the first EVA spacewalk and the first
mission carried out by a crew in shirt sleeves. The first Gemini
flight took a year longer than planned, allowing the Soviets to
complete another first flight: <font color="#a9a9a9">Voskhod 1 </font>was
launched on <font color="#dcdcdc">12 October </font>1964, the first
spacecraft with a crew of three cosmonauts. During this flight, the
Soviets touted another technical achievement: it was the first space
flight during which cosmonauts operated in a shirt-sleeve
environment. However, flying without spacesuits was not due to safety
improvements in the Soviet spacecraft's environmental systems; this
innovation was made because the spacecraft's limited cabin space did
not allow the use of spacesuits. Flying without spacesuits exposed
cosmonauts to a significant risk of potentially fatal
depressurisation of the cabin. This feat was not repeated until the
flight of the US Apollo Command Module in 1968, a later mission
designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a
shirt-sleeve environment while in space.</p>

Leonid Brezhnev and a small group of high-ranking Communist Party
officials ousted Khrushchev as head of the Soviet government the day
after Voskhod 1 landed, in the so-called &quot;Wednesday Conspiracy&quot;.
The new political leaders, together with Korolev, ended the
technically troublesome Voskhod programme, cancelled the Voskhod 3
and 4 that were in the planning stages and began to focus on the race
to the Moon. Voskhod 2 was ultimately Korolev's last achievement
before his death on <font color="#a9a9a9">14 January 1966</font>, as
it became the last of many spacecraft debuts that demonstrated the
Soviet Union's superior position in spacecraft technology in the

achievements marked &quot;the absolute pinnacle of the Soviet space

launching a two-cosmonaut Voskhod 2 flight with Pavel Belyayev and
<font color="#dcdcdc">Alexei Leonov</font>. Voskhod 2's design
changes included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow
spacewalking (EVA), while keeping the cabin pressurised to prevent
the capsule electronics from overheating. Leonov performed the first
EVA as part of the mission. Death was narrowly avoided when Leonov's
spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space, preventing him from going
back into the airlock. To survive this, he had to partially
depressurise his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level. Leonov
managed to safely re-enter the spacecraft, but he and Belyayev faced
new challenges when the spacecraft's air control system filled the
cabin with 45% pure oxygen, which had to be reduced to an acceptable
level before returning. Two further challenges were encountered
during the landing: an ill-timed retro-rocket launch caused Voskhod 2
to land 386 kilometres from its planned destination, the city of
Perm, and an instrument failure to disengage the landing gear caused
the spacecraft to become unstable during the landing.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The first landing was followed by a
second precision landing on Apollo 12 <font color="#a9a9a9">in
November 1969</font>. NASA had achieved its goal for the first
landing, and enough Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V launch vehicles
remained for the next eight lunar landings up to Apollo 20. The
Apollo Applications Program was also planned, which would develop a
longer-duration Earth-orbiting workshop (later Skylab) built from the
used S-IVB orbital stage using several launches of the smaller Saturn
IB launcher. However, the designers soon decided that this could be
accomplished more efficiently by using the two live stages of Saturn
V from the S-IVB (which was also the third stage of Saturn V) to
launch the prefabricated workshop, thus eliminating Apollo 20
immediately. The belt-tightening soon led NASA to also cut Apollo 18
and 19, but kept the three extended/Lunar Rover flights. Apollo 13's
spacecraft developed a fault during flight and had to abort its
landing on the Moon in April 1970, with the crew returning safely,
but the programme was again temporarily suspended. The programme
continued with four successful landings: Apollo 14 (<font color="#dcdcdc">February

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After losing the race to the Moon,
the Soviet Union decided to focus on building space stations in
orbit. In 1969 and 1970, it launched six more Soyuz missions after
Soyuz 3, and then launched the first space station, the Kerim
Kerimov-designed Salyut 1 laboratory, <font color="#a9a9a9">on 19
April 1971.</font> Three days later, the crew of Soyuz 10 attempted
to dock with it, but failed to establish a secure enough connection
to reach the station safely. The Soyuz 11 crew of <font color="#dcdcdc">Vladislav
Volkov, Georgy Dobrovolsky and Viktor Pachayev </font>successfully
docked on 7 June and stayed at the station for a record 22 days. The
crew became the second spaceflight fatality during the return on 30
June. They suffocated when the spacecraft's cabin depressurised
shortly after docking. The accident was blamed on a faulty cabin
pressure valve that let all the air out into space. The crew were not
wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival when the leak
occurred.</p>

October </font>after <font color="#dcdcdc">175 days </font>in orbit.
The Soviet Union attempted to launch a second Salyut-class station,
called Durable Orbital Station-2 (DOS-2) on 29 July 1972, but a
<font color="#2f4f4f">rocket failure </font>prevented it from
entering orbit. After the failure of DOS-2, the Soviet Union
attempted to launch four more Salyut-class stations until 1975, but
again failed because the last rocket stage exploded, sending
fragments into the station that failed to hold pressure. Although all
the Salyuts were presented to the public as non-military scientific
laboratories, some were actually shelters for the military Almaz
reconnaissance stations.</p>

developed its own large space shuttle under the Buran programme.
However, the Soviet Union collapsed in , and in 1991 the remnants of
