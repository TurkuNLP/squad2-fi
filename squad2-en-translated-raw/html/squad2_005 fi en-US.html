defined only as the secondary xylem in the trunk of a tree, or it is
more broadly defined to include the same type of tissue elsewhere,
such as in the roots of trees and shrubs.[citation needed] In living
trees, it acts as a support that allows woody plants to grow large or
to stand upright on their own. It also transports water and <font color="#6b8e23">nutrients

refer to other plant materials with similar properties, as well as
materials made from wood, wood chips or fibres.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the Berlin Conference in the
late 19th century, European empires and their armies set sail for the
Horn of Africa. Waving imperial clouds over Somalia alerted the
Dervish leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, who gathered Somali soldiers
from across the Horn of Africa and launched one of the longest
anti-colonial wars ever. The Dervish successfully fought off the
British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal
region. As a result of its successes against the British, the Dervish
State received support <font color="#a9a9a9">from the Ottoman and
German empires.</font> The Turks also named Hassan as Emir of the
Somali nation, and the Germans promised to formally recognise any
territory the Dervishes would take over. After a quarter of a century
of British containment, the Dervishes were finally defeated in <font color="#dcdcdc">1920</font>,
when Britain bombed the Dervish capital of <font color="#2f4f4f">Taleex
with </font>aircraft for the first time in Africa. As a result of
this bombing, the former Dervish territories were made a British
protectorate. Italy faced similar opposition from the Somali sultans
and armies and did not gain full control of part of what is now
Somalia until the fascist era in late 1927. This occupation lasted
until 1941, when it was replaced by a British military regime.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">To the extent that Italy held the
territory under a UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions allowed the
Somalis to gain experience in political education and
self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, which
was to be incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have.
Although British colonial officials tried to make up for the earlier
neglect in the 1950s through various administrative developments, the
protectorate stalled. Differences in economic development and
political experience between the regions created serious difficulties
when it came time to merge the two parts. Under pressure from their
World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British
'returned' Haudi (an important Somali grazing area supposedly
'protected' by treaties signed between the British and Somalis in
1884 and 1886) and <font color="#dcdcdc">Ogaden </font>to Ethiopia in
1948 under a treaty signed in 1897, in which the British ceded Somali
territories <font color="#2f4f4f">to the </font>Ethiopian <font color="#2f4f4f">Emperor
Menelik </font>in return for his help in combating raids by Somali
clans. Britain included a condition in the agreement that the Somali
nomads would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed
sovereignty. This led Britain to try unsuccessfully to <font color="#556b2f">buy
</font>back the Somali lands it had ceded in <font color="#556b2f">1956.
</font>Britain also granted the administration of the almost

by Hodgson et al (<font color="#a9a9a9">2014</font>), Afroasiatic
languages were likely spread in Africa and the Middle East by an
ancestral population(s) with a newly identified non-African genetic
component, which the researchers call <font color="#dcdcdc">an

ethiosomal component is now most prevalent in Afro-Asian speaking
populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak in

closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component and is
believed to have diverged from all other non-African lineages <font color="#556b2f">at

that the original Ethio-Somali ancestral population probably arrived
in the pre-civilisation period <font color="#6b8e23">from the Middle
East and entered </font>north-east Africa via the Sinai Peninsula.
The population then probably split into two branches, one heading

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Koranic schools (also known as
<font color="#a9a9a9">dugsi) </font>remain the basic system of
traditional religious education in Somalia. They provide Islamic
education for children and thus fulfil a clear religious and social
function in the country. They are known as the most stable local,
informal education system providing basic religious and moral
instruction, and their strength is based on community support and the
use of locally produced and widely available educational materials.
The Quranic system, which teaches the largest number of students
relative to other aspects of education, is often the only system
within the reach of Somalis in nomadic areas compared to urban areas.
A 1993 study found, among other things, that &quot;unlike in primary
schools, where the gender gap is huge, about <font color="#dcdcdc">40%
of </font>pupils in Quranic schools are girls; but the teaching staff
have little or no qualifications for the intellectual development of

the Middle East - once part of <font color="#556b2f">the Eastern

Caliphate, the Islamic empire, following the conquest of the
followers of Mohammed<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font> Although there
were significant changes in society and political structures, the
break from antiquity was not complete. The remaining Byzantine Empire
remained in the East and remained a great power. The Empire's law
code, the Code of Justinian, was rediscovered in northern Italy in ,
and in the 1070s was widely admired in the later Middle Ages. In the
West, most kingdoms were united by a few surviving Roman
institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise
pagan Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty,
briefly established the Carolingian Empire in the late 8th and early
9th centuries. It covered much of western Europe, but later succumbed
to the pressures of internal civil wars and external invasions - from
the Vikings in the north, the Magyars in the east and the Saracens in

structure in which knights and lower-status nobles owed military
service to their overlords in exchange for the right to receive rent
from lands and estates, were two modes of social organisation in the
High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military
attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy
Land from the Muslims. Kings became leaders of centralised
nation-states, which reduced crime and violence but made the ideal of
a united Christendom more remote. Intellectual life was characterised
by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised the integration of
faith and reason, and the establishment of universities. The theology
of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and
Chaucer, the voyages of Marco Polo and the architecture of Gothic
cathedrals such as Chartres are the major achievements of the late

Christopher Columbus' first voyage to America in 1492, the conquest
of Constantinople from the Turks in <font color="#556b2f">1453</font>,
or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used. English
historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the
end of the period. For Spain, dates commonly used are the death of
King Ferdinand II in 15041516, the death of Queen Isabella I of
Castile in 1504 or the conquest of Granada in 1492. Historians of
Romance-speaking countries generally divide the Middle Ages into two
periods: an earlier 'high' period and a later 'low' period.
English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts,
generally divide the Middle Ages into three periods: 'Early', 'High'
and 'Late'. In the 19th century the whole Middle Ages were often
called the 'Dark Ages',[B] but with the introduction of these
subdivisions, the use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle
Ages, at least among historians.</p>

divided the empire into separately governed eastern and western

after the civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306-337)
re-established the <font color="#556b2f">city of Byzantium </font>in
the renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms
strengthened the state bureaucracy, reformed taxation and reinforced
the army, which bought the empire time but did not solve the problems
it faced: excessive taxation, a declining birth rate and pressure on
its borders, among others. Civil wars between rival emperors became
more common in the mid-4th century, taking soldiers from the empire's
frontier forces and allowing invaders to invade. By the 4th century,
Roman society had largely settled into a new, different form from the
earlier classical period, with a widening gap between rich and poor
and a decline in the vitality of smaller cities. Another change was
the Christianisation of the kingdom, which lasted gradually from the

Settlement did not go smoothly, and when Roman officials mismanaged

killed fighting the Norse <font color="#556b2f">at the Battle of
Adrianople</font>. In addition to the threat posed by such tribal
communities from the north, problems were caused by internal
divisions within the kingdom, particularly within the Christian
Church. In 400, the Visigoths invaded the western Roman Empire and,
although they were briefly forced back from Italy, they sacked the
city of Rome in 410. In 406 the Alans, Vandals and Suevi invaded
Gaul; over the next three years they spread across Gaul and in 409
crossed the Pyrenees into what is now Spain. A period of migration
began, with various peoples, initially largely Germanic, moving
across Europe. The Franks, Alemanni and Burgundians all ended up in
northern Gaul, while the English, Saxons and Jews settled in Britain.
The Huns began to invade the empire in the 430s; their king Attila
(r. 434-453) led invasions of the Balkans in 442 and 447, Gaul in 451
and Italy in 452. The Huns remained a threat until Attila's death in
453, when the Hun alliance he led collapsed. These tribal invasions
completely changed the political and demographic character of the
western Roman Empire.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The political structure of Western
Europe changed with the end of the unified Roman Empire. Although the
movements of peoples during this period are usually described as
'invasions', they were not just military campaigns but the movement
of whole peoples into the empire. Such movements were facilitated by
the refusal of the Western Roman elite to support the army or to pay
taxes that would have allowed the army to suppress migration.
Fifth-century emperors were often ruled by military strongmen, such
as <font color="#a9a9a9">Stilicho </font>(d. 408), <font color="#dcdcdc">Aspar
</font>(d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472) or Gundobad (d. <font color="#2f4f4f">516</font>),
who were partly or entirely non-Roman. When the generation of Western
emperors ceased to exist, many of the kings who replaced them were of
the same background. Marriages between the new kings and the Roman
elite were common. This led to Roman culture being assimilated into
the customs of the conquering tribes, including popular assemblies,
which gave free male tribesmen more say in political matters than was
usual in the Roman state. Material objects left by Romans and
conquerors are often similar, and tribal objects were often modelled
on Roman objects. Much of the scientific and literary culture of the
new empires was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An
important difference was the gradual loss of <font color="#556b2f">tax
revenues in the </font>new empires. Many of the new political
entities no longer supported their armies with taxes, relying instead
on the granting of <font color="#6b8e23">land or rents.</font> This
meant that there was no longer a need for large tax revenues, so tax
systems deteriorated. Warfare was common between and within kingdoms.
Slavery declined as supply diminished and society became more

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Between the 5th and 8th centuries,
new nations and individuals filled the political vacuum left by the
Roman central government. The Norse settled in Italy at the end of
the <font color="#a9a9a9">5th </font>century under <font color="#dcdcdc">Theodoric
</font>(d. 526) and established an empire characterised by
cooperation between Italians and Norse at least until the last years
of Theodoric's reign. The Burgundians settled in <font color="#2f4f4f">Gaul,
and after the </font><font color="#556b2f">Huns destroyed </font>their
former kingdom in 436, they founded a new kingdom in 440. The region
between present-day Geneva and Lyon grew into the Kingdom of Burgundy
in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In northern Gaul, the Franks
and Britons founded small states. The Frankish empire was
concentrated in north-eastern Gaul, and the first king of whom much
is known was <font color="#6b8e23">Childeric </font>(d. 481).[G]
Under Childeric's son Clovis (d. 509-511), the Frankish empire
expanded and converted to Christianity. The Britons, related to the
natives of Britain - now Great Britain - settled in what is now
Brittany[H] Other monarchies were established by the Visigoths in
Iberia, the Suevi in north-western Iberia and the Vandals in North
Africa. In the sixth century, the Lombards settled in northern Italy
and replaced the Kingdom of the Northern Rock with a grouping of
duchies, which sometimes elected a king to rule them all. By the end
of the sixth century, this arrangement had been replaced by a
permanent monarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">While new empires emerged in Western
Europe, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an
economic revival that lasted until the early <font color="#a9a9a9">7th

invasions; most took place <font color="#dcdcdc">in the Balkans.
</font>Peace with Persia, Rome's traditional enemy, lasted for most
of the <font color="#2f4f4f">5th </font>century. The Eastern Empire
was characterised by closer relations between the political state and
the Christian Church, and doctrinal issues took on an importance in
Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal
developments included the codification of Roman law, with the first
attempt - the Code of Theodosius - completed in <font color="#556b2f">438.
</font>Under the emperor <font color="#6b8e23">Justinian </font>(r.
527-565), a second collection, the Corpus Juris Civilis, was
compiled. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia
in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals
and the conquest of Italy from the North under Belisarius (d. 565).
The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly plague in 542
meant that the remainder of Justinian's reign focused on defensive
measures rather than further conquests. By the time of the emperor's
death, the Byzantines controlled most of Italy, North Africa and a
small foothold in southern Spain. Historians have criticised
Justinian's recaptures for over-expanding his empire and setting the
stage for Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by
Justinian's successors were due not only to excessive taxation to
finance their wars, but also to the civilian nature of the empire,
which made it difficult to raise troops.</p>

They remained a strong power until 796. A further problem for the
Empire was the interference of Emperor Maurice (r. 582-602) in
Persian politics by intervening in the succession dispute. This led
to a period of peace, but when Maurice was defeated, the Persians

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In Western Europe, some of the old
Roman elites became extinct, while others became more involved in
church than in secular affairs. The values associated with Latin
erudition and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy
remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of
elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (c. <font color="#a9a9a9">420</font>)
dreamed that God was rebuking him for spending more time reading
<font color="#dcdcdc">Cicero </font>than the Bible. In <font color="#2f4f4f">the

</font>and art had replaced books as the main means of religious
instruction in the Church. Most intellectual effort was directed
towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were
created, as well as now lost oral compositions. The writings of
Sidonius Apollinaris (d. <font color="#6b8e23">489</font>),
Cassiodorus (d. c. 585) and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Changes also took place among the
laity, as aristocratic culture shifted from literature to <font color="#a9a9a9">large
parties in </font>the halls. The elite's clothes were richly
decorated <font color="#dcdcdc">with jewels </font>and gold. Lords
and kings supported the companies of warriors who formed the backbone
of the military forces.[I] Kinship within the elite was important, as
were the virtues of loyalty, <font color="#2f4f4f">courage </font>and
honour. These ties led to the proliferation of feuds in aristocratic
society, as exemplified by the events in <font color="#556b2f">Merovingian
Gaul as </font>narrated by Gregory of Tours. Most feuds seem to have
ended quickly with the payment of some kind of compensation. Women
participated in aristocratic society mainly as wives and mothers of
men, and the role of the ruler's mother was particularly important in
Merovingian Gaul. In <font color="#6b8e23">Anglo-Saxon </font>society,
the absence of many child rulers meant a reduced role for women as
queen mothers, but this was offset by the increased role of abbesses
of monasteries. Only in Italy do women seem to have been always kept
under the protection and control of a male relative.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Peasant society is much less
documented than the nobility. Most of the information available to
historians comes from <font color="#a9a9a9">archaeology</font>; few
detailed written records of peasant life survive before <font color="#dcdcdc">the
9th </font>century. Most descriptions of the lower classes come
either from <font color="#2f4f4f">legal codes </font>or from writers
of the upper classes. Land tenure patterns were not uniform in the
West; in some areas land ownership was very fragmented, while in
other areas large homogeneous tracts of land were the norm. These
differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some
dominated by aristocratic landowners and others very independent.
Land settlement also varied widely. Some peasants lived in large
settlements with up to 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups
of a few families, while others lived on isolated farms spread out in
the countryside. There were also areas where settlement was a mixture
of two or more of these systems. Unlike in the late Roman period,
there was no sharp boundary between the legal status of a free
peasant and that of an aristocrat, and a free peasant's family could
rise to aristocracy over several generations by serving as <font color="#6b8e23">soldiers
for </font>a powerful lord.</p>

greatly in the early Middle Ages. Although Italian cities remained
inhabited, their size decreased considerably. Rome, for example,

Abbasids moved their capital <font color="#556b2f">to Baghdad</font>,
and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing some
control of Muslim lands. The descendants of the Umayyads took over
the Iberian Peninsula, the Aghlabids ruled North Africa, and <font color="#6b8e23">the
Tulunids </font>became the rulers of Egypt. By the mid-eighteenth
century, new trade patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean; trade
between Franks and Arabs replaced the old Roman trade patterns. The

and they disappeared, first inland, and by the 7th century they could

Naples. By the end of the 7th century, under the influence of <font color="#dcdcdc">the

Western Europe. The substitution of local products for wholesale
goods was a trend throughout the ancient Roman lands in the early
Middle Ages. This was particularly strong in countries not on the

goods found in the archaeological record are usually <font color="#2f4f4f">luxury
goods</font>. In the northern parts of Europe, trade networks were
not only local, but the goods transported were also simple, with
little pottery or other complex products. In the Mediterranean,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Christianity was a major unifying
factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests,
but the conquest of North Africa cut off the sea links between the

used <font color="#a9a9a9">Greek </font>instead of Western <font color="#dcdcdc">Latin.</font>
Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and

control of the church had expanded to the point where cultural and
religious differences outweighed similarities. The formal separation
occurred in <font color="#2f4f4f">1054</font>, when the papacy and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The ecclesiastical structure of the
Roman Empire remained mostly intact from the movements and invasions
in the West, but the papacy was little respected, and few of the
Western bishops looked to the Roman bishop for religious or political
leadership. Many popes before 750 were more concerned with Byzantine
affairs and eastern theological disputes. A register, or archived
copies, of the letters of Pope Gregory the Great (Pope <font color="#a9a9a9">590-604</font>)
has survived, and of the more than 850 letters, the vast majority
concerned Italian or Constantinopolitan affairs. The only part of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the early Middle Ages, the
<font color="#a9a9a9">monastic order </font>rose in the West.
European monastic life was shaped by traditions and ideas that
originated in the deserts of Egypt and Syria. Most European
monasteries were of a type centred on a communal experience of
spiritual life called kenobitism, pioneered by <font color="#dcdcdc">Pachomius
</font>(d. 348) in the 4th century. Monastic ideals spread from Egypt
to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographic
literature such as the Life of Anthony. In the 6th century, <font color="#2f4f4f">Benedict
of Nursia </font>(d. 547) wrote a Benedictine Rule for the Western
monastic community, detailing the administrative and spiritual
responsibilities of a monastic community led by <font color="#556b2f">an
abbot</font>. Monks and monasteries had a profound impact on
religious and political life in the early Middle Ages, acting in many
cases as land trusts for powerful families, centres of propaganda and
royal support in newly conquered territories, and bases for
missionary and conversion work. They were the main and sometimes the
only outposts of education and literacy in the region. Many of the
surviving manuscripts of Latin classics were copied in monasteries in
the early Middle Ages. Monks were also the authors of new works on
history, theology and other subjects, such as Bede (d. 735), a native
of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th
centuries.</p>

ruled by the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex and East Anglia,
descended from the Anglo-Saxon conquerors. The smaller kingdoms of
present-day Wales and Scotland were still ruled by the native Britons
and Picts. Ireland was divided into even smaller political units,

obtained a mandate for the coup from Pope Stephen II (Pope <font color="#556b2f">752-757</font>).
Pippin's coup was strengthened by propaganda, which portrayed the
Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers, highlighted the achievements
of Charles Martel and spread stories of the great piety of the

Charles (r. 768-814) and <font color="#6b8e23">Carloman </font>(r.

united much of Europe and eventually led to what is now France,
northern Italy and Germany. In the wars after 800, he rewarded his
allies with spoils of war and control of territory. In 774,

Roman Empire, as the new emperor ruled over much of the territory
previously ruled by the Western emperors. It also marked a change in
the relationship between Charlemagne and the Byzantine Empire, as the
Carolingians assumed the title of emperor, which meant that they were
assimilated to the Byzantine state. There were several differences
between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older
Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire of the same time. The
Frankish territories were rural in character, with only a few small

used a new style of writing, now known as Carolingian minuscules,[M]
which allowed a common style of writing that promoted communication
throughout much of Europe. Charlemagne promoted changes in church
liturgy, imposing the Roman form of worship in his own regions and
Gregorian chant in the liturgical music of churches. An important
activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correction
and dissemination of basic texts on religious and secular subjects to
promote learning. New works on religious subjects and school
textbooks were also produced. The grammarians of the period adapted
Latin, transforming it from the classical Latin of the Roman Empire
into a more flexible form to suit the needs of the Church and the
administration. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had

eldest son <font color="#556b2f">Lothair I </font>(d. 855) as emperor
and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between
Lothair and his youngest son Charles the Bald (d. 877). Lothair
received East Francia, which included both banks of the Rhine and the
east side, and Charles was left with the kingdom of West Francia,
west of the Rhine and the Alps. The middle child, <font color="#6b8e23">Louis
of Saxony </font>(d. 876), who had been a rebel until the end, was
allowed to keep Bavaria under the rule of his elder brother. The
division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. 864-after), the
emperor's grandson, rebelled against Aquitaine, while Louis of Saxony
tried to annex the whole of eastern Francia. Louis the Pious died in
840, and the kingdom was still in chaos.</p>

the invaders led to the formation of new political entities. In
Anglo-Saxon England, King Alfred the Great (r. <font color="#a9a9a9">871-899</font>)
made a deal with the Viking invaders in the late 9th century,
resulting in the Danes settling in Northumbria, Mercia and parts of
East Anglia. By the mid-10th century, Alfred's followers had
conquered Northumbria and restored English control over most of
southern Britain. In northern Britain, Kenneth MacAlpin (d. c. 860)
united the Picts and Scots <font color="#dcdcdc">in the Kingdom of

Theophanes (d. 991), daughter of the former Byzantine emperor Romanos
II (r. 959-963). By the late 10th century, Italy had been drawn under
Ottonian rule after a period of instability; Otto III (r. 996-1002)
spent much of his later reign in the kingdom. The western Frankish
empire was more fragmented, and while kings remained nominally in
power, much political power was devolved to local lords.</p>

and his successors Leo VI (r. 886-912) and Constantine VII (r.

the extension of unified administration to all provinces. Military
organisation was reformed, allowing Emperors John I (r. 969-976) and
Basil II (r. 976-1025) to expand the empire's borders on all fronts.
The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical
scholarship known as the Macedonian Renaissance. Writers such as John
Geometres (d. early <font color="#556b2f">10th </font>century) wrote
new hymns, poems and other works. The missionary work of both Eastern
and Western clergy led to the conversion of Muravians, Bulgarians,
Bohemians, Poles, Magyars and Slavs from Kievan Rus. These
conversions contributed to the establishment of political states in
the lands of these peoples - the Moravian, Bulgarian, Bohemian,
Polish, Hungarian and Kievan Rus states. Bulgaria, founded around
680, stretched from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper
River in present-day Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea. By 1018, the last

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the later Roman Empire, the
most important military developments were efforts to create an
effective cavalry force and the continued development of highly
specialised forces. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type
soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the Roman army in the
5th century. Different invader tribes placed different emphasis on
different types of military, from the Anglo-Saxon invaders of
Britain, who mainly <font color="#a9a9a9">used infantry, to the
</font>Vandals and Visigoths, whose armies had a high proportion of
<font color="#dcdcdc">cavalry.</font> In the early invasion period,
the infantry had not yet adopted warfare, which limited the
usefulness of the cavalry as a strike force, as the full power of the
horse and rider could not be used behind the rider's strikes. The
biggest change in military matters during the offensive period was
the introduction of the <font color="#2f4f4f">Hun compound bow </font>to
replace the earlier and weaker Scythian <font color="#556b2f">compound
bow. </font>Another development was the increased use of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the Carolingian period, art
was produced for a small group of people at court and for the
monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by attempts
to recapture the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and
Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the island art of the
British Isles. Island art combined the energy of Irish-Celtic and
Anglo-Saxon Germanic ornamental styles with Mediterranean forms such
as the book, and created many of the characteristics of late medieval
art. The religious works that survive from the early Middle Ages are
mostly <font color="#a9a9a9">illuminated manuscripts </font>and
carved ivories, originally made for metalwork and later fused.
Precious metal objects were the most valuable form of art, but almost
all have disappeared except for a few crosses such as <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Cross of Lothair</font>, several reliquaries and finds such as the
Anglo-Saxon tomb of Sutton Hoo and the Gourdon jewels from
Merovingian France, the <font color="#2f4f4f">Guarrazar </font>jewels
from Visigothic Spain and the <font color="#556b2f">Nagyszentmiklós
</font>jewels from Byzantium. Large brooches have also survived from
the Irish Tara brooch, which were a key part of the personal
adornment of the elite, such as the Irish Tara brooch. Richly
decorated books were mostly Gospel books, and larger numbers have
survived, including the Kells' Ashes, the Lindisfarne Book and the
imperial <font color="#6b8e23">Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, </font>one
of the few to have survived a gold 'treasure-binding' encrusted with
precious stones. The court of Charlemagne seems to have contributed
to the acceptance of figurative monumental sculpture in Christian
art, and by the end of the period, almost life-size figures, such as
the cross of Gero, were common in important churches.</p>

proportion of Carolingian armies were cavalry, a large proportion of
the early period armies appear to have been mounted infantry rather
than cavalry proper. The exception was <font color="#2f4f4f">Anglo-Saxon
England</font>, where armies still consisted of regional armies
called fyrds, led by a local elite. In terms of military technology,
one of the most important changes was the return of the <font color="#556b2f">crossbow</font>,

of </font>Europe's population remained rural. Many no longer lived on
isolated farms, but were clustered in small communities, usually
called estates or <font color="#556b2f">villages</font>. These
peasants were often subject to the overlords of the nobility, to whom
they owed rents and other services, a system known as manorial
serfdom. There were free peasants throughout this period and beyond,
and they were more numerous in the southern regions of Europe than in
the north. Population growth was also influenced by the fact that new
lands were brought into production by offering incentives to the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Other parts of society were the
nobility, the clergy and the townspeople. The nobles, both noblemen
and simple knights, exploited the manors and peasants, even if they
did not own the land directly but were entitled to the income from
the manor or other land through the feudal system. These lands, or
<font color="#a9a9a9">fiefs</font>, began to be regarded as
hereditary in the 1100s <font color="#a9a9a9">and </font>1200s and
could no longer be divided among all the heirs in most regions, as
had been the case in the early Middle Ages. Instead, most fiefdoms
and lands went to <font color="#dcdcdc">the eldest son</font>.[R] The
nobility's position of power was based on their ownership of land,
military service with a heavy cavalry, control of castles and various
exemptions from taxes and other levies.[S] Castles, initially <font color="#2f4f4f">wooden
</font>and later stone, began to be built in the 13th and 13th
centuries in response to the disorder of the time, providing
protection against invaders and enabling lords to defend themselves
against rivals. Control of the castles enabled nobles to challenge
kings or other overlords. The nobility was divided into different
layers; kings and the highest ranking nobility controlled large
numbers of commoners and large areas of land, as well as other
nobles. Below them, the lower nobles controlled smaller areas of land
and fewer people. <font color="#6b8e23">Knights were the </font>lowest
level of nobility; they ruled but did not own land, and had to serve
other nobles[T].</p>

nobility</font>, the same social class that served as a recruiting
ground for the upper echelons of the secular clergy. Local parish
priests were often chosen <font color="#6b8e23">from the peasant
class</font>. Townspeople were in a somewhat unusual position, as
they did not fit into the traditional social triad of nobles, clergy
and peasants. In the 1200s and 1200s, the number of townspeople
expanded considerably as existing towns grew and new settlements were
established. But throughout the Middle Ages, the urban population
probably never exceeded 10% of the total population.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the Middle Ages, women were
officially required to be subordinate to a man, be it a father,
husband or other relative. Widows, who often had a great deal of
control over their own lives, were still legally restricted. Women's
work usually consisted of domestic chores or other domestic tasks.
Peasant women were generally responsible for <font color="#a9a9a9">household
chores</font>, childcare, gardening and raising livestock in the
vicinity of the house. They could supplement the household income by
spinning or <font color="#dcdcdc">brewing </font>at home. At harvest
time, they were also expected to <font color="#2f4f4f">help in the
fields</font>. Like peasant women, urban women were responsible for
the household, and they may also have been involved in trade. The
occupations open to women varied from country to country and from
period to period. Noblewomen were in charge of the household, and
could sometimes be expected to run estates in the absence of male
relatives, but they were generally not allowed to take part in
military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the
church was that <font color="#556b2f">of nuns, who </font>could not

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In central and northern Italy and
Flanders, the emergence of somewhat self-governing towns fostered
economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade
unions. Commercial cities on the shores of the <font color="#a9a9a9">Baltic
Sea </font>concluded treaties known as the Hanseatic League, and
Italian maritime republics such as Venice, <font color="#dcdcdc">Genoa
</font>and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean.[V]
In northern France, large trade fairs were established and flourished
during this period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade
with each other and with local traders. In the late 13th century, new
land and sea routes to the Far East were established, famously
described in the voyages of Marco Polo, written by one of the
traders, <font color="#2f4f4f">Marco Polo </font>(d. 1324). In
addition to new trading opportunities, improvements in agriculture
and technology allowed for the proliferation of crops, which in turn
enabled the expansion of trade networks. The increase in trade
brought new methods of handling money, and gold coins began to be
minted again in Europe, first <font color="#556b2f">in Italy </font>and
later in France and other countries. New forms of trade contracts
emerged that allowed risk to be shared between traders. Accounting
methods improved, partly thanks to <font color="#6b8e23">double-entry

easy transfer of money.</p>

formative period in the history of the modern Western state. The
kings of France, <font color="#a9a9a9">England </font>and Spain
consolidated their power and established lasting institutions. New
kingdoms such as <font color="#dcdcdc">Hungary </font>and Poland
became the great powers of Central Europe after converting to

laid claim to temporal power in the Christian world as a whole; papal
monarchy reached its peak in the early 13th century during the
pontificate of Innocent III (Pope <font color="#6b8e23">1198-1216</font>).
The Northern Crusades and the advance of Christian kingdoms and
military organisations into previously pagan areas of the Baltic and

instability until the imperial throne was taken over by Frederick I
Barbarossa (r. 1155-90). Although he ruled effectively, the basic
problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the
13th century. Barbarossa's grandson, <font color="#6b8e23">Frederick
II </font>(r. 1220-1250), who was also heir to the Sicilian throne
through his mother, repeatedly clashed with the Pope. His court was
famous for its doctrine and he was often accused of heresy. He and
his successors faced many difficulties, including the Mongol invasion
of Europe in the mid-13th century. The Mongols first crushed the Rus

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the Capetian dynasty, France
slowly began to expand the power of the nobility, which grew from
Île-de-France and began to rule an ever larger part of the country
in the 1100s and 1200s. They faced a powerful rival, the Dukes of
Normandy, who in 1066, under <font color="#a9a9a9">William the
Conqueror </font>(Duke 1035-1087), conquered England (r. <font color="#dcdcdc">1066-87</font>)
and created a trans-Channel empire that lasted in various forms
throughout the Middle Ages. The Normans also settled in Sicily and
southern Italy when Robert Guiscard (d. <font color="#2f4f4f">1085</font>)
landed there in 1059 and established the duchy that later became <font color="#556b2f">the
Kingdom of Sicily</font>. During the Angevin dynasty of Henry II (r.
1154-89) and his son Richard I (r. 1189-99), English kings ruled
England and large areas of France[W], which was dominated by Henry
II's marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine (d. Richard's younger brother
John (r. 1199-1216) lost Normandy and the rest of northern France in
1204 to Philip II Augustus (r. 1180-1223), King of France. This led
to dissension among the English nobility, and John's financial
demands to pay for his failed attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215
to Magna Carta, a charter establishing the rights and privileges of
free men in England. Under John's son Henry III (r. 1216-72), further
concessions were made to the nobility and the king's power was
reduced. The French monarchy continued its anti-nobility gains in the
late 13th and 13th centuries, taking more and more areas of the
kingdom under its personal rule and centralising royal
administration. Under Louis IX (r. 1226-70), the king's authority
rose to new heights as he acted as a mediator for most of Europe[Y].</p>

Empire by capturing much of its population and its economic
heartland. Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat,
they never fully recovered Asia Minor and were often on the
defensive. The Turks also faced difficulties: they lost control of
Jerusalem <font color="#6b8e23">to the Egyptian Fatimids </font>and

the Crusaders left their lands for the East. They were particularly
brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities of
Cologne, Mainz and Worms were destroyed and other communities in the
cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine were devastated. Another
consequence of the Crusades was the establishment of a new kind of

Templars and Hospitaller Knights took part in the Spanish Crusades,
similar Spanish military religious orders were established, most of
which by the early 1200s had joined the two main orders, the Order of
Calatrava and the Order of Santiago. Northern Europe also remained
outside Christian influence until or after the 1100s and became the
scene of the Crusades as part of the Northern Crusades of the

theology in the 1100s led to an increase in intellectual activity.
There was a debate between <font color="#a9a9a9">realists </font>and
nominalists about the concept of &quot;universals&quot;. The
philosophical debate was fuelled by the rediscovery of <font color="#dcdcdc">Aristotle
</font>and his emphasis on empiricism and rationalism. Scholars such
as Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and Peter Lombard (<font color="#2f4f4f">1164</font>)
introduced Aristotelian logic into theology. In the late 11th and
early 12th centuries, cathedral schools spread throughout Western
Europe, which meant a shift of learning from monasteries to
cathedrals and cities. Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by
universities in Europe's major cities. Philosophy and theology merged
in <font color="#556b2f">scholasticism</font>, the attempt by 1200s
and 1300s scholars to reconcile authoritative texts, particularly
those of Aristotle and the Bible. This movement sought a systemic
approach to truth and reason, culminating in the ideas of <font color="#6b8e23">Thomas

in the vernacular, rather than Latin, and consisted of poems,
stories, legends and folk songs spread by the troubadours, or

the development of stone building, which developed vernacular
Romanesque forms, hence the term &quot;Romanesque&quot;. Materials
for Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled wherever they were
available. From its cautious beginnings, first known as Romanesque,
the style flourished and spread throughout Europe with considerable
uniformity. Just before the year <font color="#dcdcdc">1000, </font>a
great wave of stone churches was built across Europe. Romanesque
buildings have massive stone walls, openings crowned by semi-circular
arches, small windows and, especially in France, <font color="#2f4f4f">arched
stone vaults</font>. Large portals with coloured, high-relief
carvings became a central feature of the façades, especially in
France, and the tops of the columns were often carved with fanciful
stories of monsters and animals. According to the art historian <font color="#556b2f">C.
R. Dodwell</font>, 'almost all western churches were decorated with
wall paintings', of which few survive. In parallel with the

in the secular church. Pope Leo IX (Pope <font color="#a9a9a9">1049-1054</font>)
brought its underlying ideals to the papal election, and they
provided the ideology for the independence of the clergy that led to
the investiture controversy of the late 1100s. It involved <font color="#2f4f4f">Pope
Gregory VII </font>(Pope 1073-85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially
clashed over the appointment of bishops, a dispute that turned into a
battle over the ideas of investiture, ecclesiastical marriage and
simony. The emperor considered the protection of the Church one of
his duties and also wanted to retain the right to appoint his own
elect as bishops in his own lands, but the papacy insisted on the
independence of the Church from secular lords. These issues remained
unresolved after the compromise <font color="#556b2f">known as </font>the

that Benedictine monastic life no longer met the needs of the laity,
who, together with those who wanted a religious life, wished to
return to the simpler hermitage life of early Christianity or to live
an apostolic life. Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged. Old

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">These problems were followed in1347
by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread across Europe over the
next three years.AC] The death toll in Europe was probably around one
million35 people, about a third of the population. Cities were
particularly badly affected because they were crowded.[AD] Large
areas of land were sparsely populated, and in some places fields were
left uncultivated. Wages rose as landowners tried to attract the
reduced number of available workers to their fields. Other problems
included falling rents and reduced demand for food, both of which cut
farm incomes. Urban workers also felt entitled to higher wages, and
uprisings broke out across Europe. Such revolts included the
<font color="#2f4f4f">jacquerie </font>in France, the <font color="#556b2f">peasant
rebellion </font>in England, and revolts in <font color="#6b8e23">Florence
</font>in Italy and the towns of Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The
trauma of the Plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe,
manifested in the creation of new charities, the self-immolation of
flagellants and the scapegoating of Jews. The return of the Ruth
continued to destabilise conditions throughout the 13th century,
hitting Europe at regular intervals throughout the rest of the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The disruption caused by the Black
Death disrupted society across Europe. Land that had been only
marginally productive was abandoned as survivors were able to acquire
more fertile areas. While serfdom declined in Western Europe, it
became more common in Eastern Europe as landowners imposed it on
their tenants who had previously been free. In Western Europe, most
peasants managed to convert the labour they had previously owed to
their landlords <font color="#dcdcdc">into cash rent. The </font>share
of serfs among peasants fell from a high of <font color="#2f4f4f">90%
to less than </font>50% by the end of the period. Landlords also
became more aware that they had common interests with other
landowners and joined together to extort privileges from governments.
Partly at the urging of landowners, governments attempted to
legislate to restore the economic conditions that existed before the
Black Death. Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and the urban
population began to emulate the nobility's interest in <font color="#6b8e23">chivalry</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Throughout the 13th century, French
kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the
territorial holdings of the nobility. They got into trouble when they
tried to seize the estates of English kings in southern France,
leading to the Hundred Years' War, which was fought from <font color="#a9a9a9">1337
to 1453</font>. In the early stages of the war, the English, under
Edward III (r. <font color="#dcdcdc">1327-77</font>) and his son
Edward, <font color="#2f4f4f">Prince of Black </font>(d. 1376),[AF]
won the battles of <font color="#556b2f">Crécy </font>and Poitiers,
captured the city of Calais and took control of much of France.[AG]
The resulting tensions almost caused the break-up of the Kingdom of
France in the early years of the war. By the early 1400s, France was
again close to disintegration, but in the late <font color="#6b8e23">1420s
</font>the military success of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to a French
victory and the capture of the last English possessions in southern
France in 1453. The cost was high, as the population of France at the
end of the wars was probably half that at the start of the conflict.
On the other hand, the wars had a positive impact on English national
identity, as they did much to fuse different local identities into a
single national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped
to create a national culture in England that was separate from the
French culture that had previously been the dominant influence. The
dominance of the English longbow began in the early stages of the
Hundred Years' War, with the cannon appearing on the battlefield at
Crécy in 1346.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In modern Germany, the rule of the
Holy Roman Empire continued, but because of the elective nature of
the imperial crown, there was no permanent dynasty around which a

Hungary and <font color="#a9a9a9">Bohemia </font>grew strong. The
Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula continued to gain land
from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula. Portugal focused on
expanding abroad in the 15th century, while other kingdoms were torn

France. Much of the literature remained religious, and although much
of it continued to be written in <font color="#556b2f">Latin</font>,
the Lives of the Saints and other devotional writings in the
vernacular found a new demand. This was fuelled by the growth of the
Devotio Moderna movement, most notably in the founding of the Order
of the Common Life, but also in the works of German mystics such as
<font color="#6b8e23">Meister Eckhart </font>and Johannes Tauler (d.
1361). Theatre also developed in the form of miracle performances by
the Church. Towards the end of the period, the development of the
printing press around 1450 led to the establishment of publishing
houses throughout Europe by 1500.</p>

Gothic was the courtly style that reached much of Europe in the
decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the <font color="#2f4f4f">Très
Riches Heures du Duc de Berry</font>. Throughout Europe, secular art
continued to increase in both quantity and quality, and in the 15th
century the merchant classes of Italy and Flanders became important
patrons, commissioning small oil paintings of themselves and an
increasing number of luxury items such as jewellery, ivory coffins,
cassone coffins and maiolica vessels. These included Hispano-Moresque
vessels, mainly made by <font color="#556b2f">Mudéjar potters </font>in
Spain. Although the royals owned vast collections of tableware, very
little survives, with the exception of <font color="#6b8e23">the

churches and elites no longer had to rely on imports from Byzantium
or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders, gobelin weaving, which

from <font color="#a9a9a9">phonetics</font>. Phonetics deals with the
physical production, acoustic transmission and perception of speech
sounds, while phonology describes the way sounds function within a

consider phonetics to belong to <font color="#dcdcdc">descriptive
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">linguistics </font>and phonology to
theoretical <font color="#556b2f">linguistics</font>, although
defining the phonological system of a language is necessarily an
application of theoretical principles to the analysis of sound data.
It should be noted that this distinction was not always made,
especially before the modern concept of phoneme was developed in <font color="#6b8e23">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The word phonology comes <font color="#a9a9a9">from
the Greek </font>φωνή, phōnḗ, &quot;voice, sound&quot;, and
the suffix -logy (which comes from the Greek λόγος, <font color="#dcdcdc">lógos</font>,
&quot;word, speech, topic of conversation&quot;). The definitions of
the term vary. <font color="#2f4f4f">Nikolai Trubetzkoy, </font>in
his Grundzüge der Phonologie (1939), defines phonology as 'the study
of sounds related to the language system', as opposed to phonetics,
which is 'the study of sounds related to the act of <font color="#556b2f">speech</font>'
(the distinction between language and speech is essentially
Saussure's distinction between langue and parole). More recently,
Lass (<font color="#6b8e23">1998</font>) has written that phonology
broadly refers to the branch of linguistics that deals with the
sounds of language, while more narrowly, &quot;phonology proper deals
with the function, behaviour and organisation of sounds as linguistic
elements&quot;. According to Clark et al. (2007), it refers to the
systematic use of sounds to encode meaning in any spoken human
language, or to the field of linguistics that studies this use.</p>

converted into the actual phoneme (the so-called surface phoneme). An

was the underemphasis on syllables and the <font color="#556b2f">emphasis

on the publications of its proponent <font color="#a9a9a9">David
Stampen </font>in 1969 and (more specifically) 1979. According to
this view, phonology is based on <font color="#dcdcdc">a set of
universal phonological processes that </font>interact with each
other; which ones are active and which <font color="#2f4f4f">are
repressed </font>is language-specific. Rather than affecting
segments, phonological processes affect specific features within
prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a
syllable or as large as a whole sentence. Phonological processes are
disordered with respect to each other and operate simultaneously
(although the output of one process may be the input of another). The
second best known natural phonologist is <font color="#556b2f">Patricia
Donegan </font>(Stampen's wife); there are many natural phonologists

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">An important part of traditional,
pre-generational phonology is the study of which sounds can be
grouped into distinct units within a language; these units are called
<font color="#a9a9a9">phonemes</font>. For example, in English, the
'p' sound in pot is aspirated (pronounced [pʰ]), while the sound in
spot is not aspirated (pronounced [p]). However, <font color="#dcdcdc">English
</font>speakers intuitively consider both sounds to be variations
(<font color="#2f4f4f">allophones) of the </font>same phonological
category, the phoneme /p/. (Traditionally, it has been argued that if
the aspirous [pʰ] were replaced by <font color="#556b2f">the
non-aspirous </font>[p] sound of spot, native English speakers would
still hear the same words; that is, the two sounds are perceived as
the 'same' /p/). In some other languages, however, the two phonemes
are perceived as different, and are therefore classified as different
phonemes. For example, <font color="#6b8e23">in Thai, Hindi and
Quechua, </font>there are a minimal number of word pairs where
aspiration is the only opposite feature (two words can have different
meanings, but the only difference in pronunciation is that one has an
aspirated sound while the other has <font color="#a0522d">an
unaspirated sound</font>).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In most computers, individual
instructions are stored as machine code, and each instruction is
given a unique number (an operation code, or opcode for short). A
command that adds two numbers together has one opcode; a command that
adds two numbers together has a different opcode, and so on. The
simplest computers can execute any of a handful of different
instructions; more complex computers have several hundred different
instructions to choose from, each with a unique numeric code. Because
a computer's memory can store numbers, it can also store instruction
codes. This leads to the important point that entire programs (which
are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of
numbers and can be processed in the computer in the same way as
numerical data. The basic concept of storing programs in computer
memory alongside the data they process is at the heart of von
Neumann's stored program architecture. In some cases, a computer may
store part or all of its program in memory, which is kept separate
from the data it uses. This is called the<font color="#a9a9a9">

different ways of defining programs for computers to run. Unlike
natural languages, programming languages are designed to be
ambiguity-free and concise. They are purely written languages and are
often difficult to read aloud. They are usually translated into
machine code, either by <font color="#a9a9a9">a compiler or assembler

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although writing long programs in
assembler is much easier than in machine language, it is often
difficult and error-prone. Therefore, most practical programs are
written in more abstract high-level programming languages that can
express the programmer's needs more easily (and thus reduce
programming errors). High-level programming languages are usually
&quot;translated&quot; into machine language (or sometimes assembly
language and then machine language) using another computer program
called a <font color="#a9a9a9">compiler.</font> High-level languages
have less to do with the operation of the target computer than an
assembly language, and more to do with the language and structure of
the problem(s) that the final program is intended to solve. It is
therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the
same high-level language program into the machine language of many
different types of computers. This is part of the way in which
software such as video games can be made available for different
computer architectures, such as personal computers and different

Otherwise benign bugs can sometimes be harnessed for malicious

This number far exceeded the number of slaves exported to the

descendants of this diaspora in the Arab societies of the 21st
century: traders transported more female slaves than male slaves
because of the <font color="#556b2f">demand for them as concubines </font>in
the Arabian Peninsula and neighbouring harems. Male slaves were
castrated so that they could be used as harem guards. The death rate
of black African slaves from forced labour was high. The <font color="#6b8e23">mixed-race
children of female slaves and Arab owners </font>were assimilated
into the families of Arab owners according to a patrilineal family
system. As a result, few distinctive Afro-Arab black communities have

Negro had supplanted colored as the most polite word for African

until the later civil rights movement in the late 1960s. One
well-known example is the <font color="#6b8e23">Reverend Martin

in his famous 1963 speech I Have a Dream. During the US civil rights
movement in the 1950s and 1960s, some African American leaders in the
US, notably Malcolm X, opposed the word Negro because they associated
it with a long history of slavery, segregation and discrimination, in
which African Americans were treated as second-class citizens or
worse. Malcolm X preferred to use the word black rather than Negro,
but later gradually abandoned it too and changed it to African
American after resigning from the Nation of Islam.</p>

lived in the United States, they identified themselves primarily <font color="#a9a9a9">by

and not by the colour of their skin. Individuals identified
themselves as Ashanti, Igbo, Bakongo, or Wolof, for example. When the
first captives were brought to America, however, they were often
associated with other groups from West Africa, and English settlers
did not generally recognize <font color="#dcdcdc">individual
ethnicity.</font> In the upper South, different ethnic groups were
combined. This is significant because the captives came from a wide
geographical area: <font color="#2f4f4f">from the West African coast,
stretching from Senegal to Angola, and in some cases from the
south-east coast</font>, such as Mozambique. A new African-American
identity and culture emerged, incorporating elements from different
ethnic groups and European cultural heritage, resulting in, for
example, the Black Church and Black English. <font color="#556b2f">This
new identity was based on origin and slavery </font>rather than
membership in any ethnic group. In contrast, slave registers from

African identity <font color="#dcdcdc">would hinder their struggle

ammunition to those who advocated the return of blacks back to
Africa. In <font color="#2f4f4f">1835, </font>black leaders urged
black Americans to remove the term &quot;African&quot; from their
institutions and replace it with &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Colored
American.&quot; A few institutions chose to retain their historic
names, such as the <font color="#556b2f">African Methodist Episcopal

1785 by publisher <font color="#a9a9a9">John Walter as </font><font color="#dcdcdc">The
Daily Universal Register, with </font>Walter as editor-in-chief.
Walter had lost his job at the end of 1784 after the insurance
company he worked for went bankrupt following complaints about a
hurricane in Jamaica. Unemployed, Walter decided to start a new
business. It was at this time that Henry Johnson invented logography,
a new typography that was faster and more accurate (three years later
it turned out that it was not as efficient as it was said to be).
Walter bought a patent for logography and decided to use it to open a
printing press where he would produce a daily advertising journal.
The Daily Universal Register newspaper was first published in the UK
on 1 January <font color="#2f4f4f">1785. </font>Dissatisfied with the
constant omission of the word Universal, Ellias changed the title
after the 1 January 1788 editions940 to The Times. In 1803, Walter
transferred ownership and editorship to his son of the same name.
Walter senior had spent sixteen months in Newgate Prison <font color="#6b8e23">for
libel </font>printed in The Times<font color="#6b8e23">, but </font>his
pioneering efforts to obtain continental news, particularly from
France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy makers and

to improve readability and save space. Times New Roman made its debut
in the 3 October 1932 issue. A year later, the design was released
for commercial sale. The Times remained Times New Roman for many
years40 , but new production techniques and the change of format from
broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 led the newspaper to change the font
five times since 1972. However, all the new fonts have been

overtly Conservative or Whig, but it has long been a bastion of
English power and empire. In the 1945 general election, The Times
adopted a stance that was described as '<font color="#dcdcdc">strangely
indifferent</font>'; while increasingly critical of the Conservative
campaign, it did not advocate voting for any party. In the next
election, however, five years later, the newspaper returned to the
Conservative side. In the next three elections it supported the
Conservatives, then it supported both the Conservatives and the
Liberal Party in the next five elections, and in 1974 it explicitly
supported <font color="#2f4f4f">a Conservative-Liberal coalition.
Thereafter</font>, the paper steadily supported <font color="#556b2f">the

Lutyens </font>(Sir Edwin since 1918), who first visited Delhi in
1912, and Herbert Baker (Sir Herbert since 1926), both leading
British architects of the 20th century. The building contract was

after the First World War and was completed in 1931. Later called
'Lutyens Delhi', the city was inaugurated by Viceroy Lord Irwin at a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Soon Lutyens began to consider other
places. The Delhi Town Planning Committee, chaired by George Swinton
and consisting of John A. Brodie and Lutyens, was set up to plan the
new imperial capital and submitted reports on both the north and
south. However, it was rejected by <font color="#a9a9a9">the Viceroy
when the </font>cost of acquiring the necessary real estate was found
to be too high. New Delhi's central axis, which today points east at
India Gate, was earlier supposed to be a north-south axis connecting
the Viceroy's house at one end and Paharganj at the other. In the
early years of the project, many tourists believed that it was a
gateway from earth to heaven itself. Due to lack of space and the
numerous heritage sites to the north, the Committee eventually
settled on <font color="#dcdcdc">a southern location.</font> The site
of the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy's House, was
chosen to be at the top of the Raisina hill, which was the former
Raisina village, Meo village. The choice was based on the fact that
the hill was located directly opposite the <font color="#2f4f4f">Dinapanah
Fort</font>, which was also considered to be the site of
Indraprastha, the ancient site of Delhi. Later, the foundation stone
was moved from the site of the 1911-1912 Delhi Durbar, where the
coronation pillar stood, and embedded in the walls of the front
courtyard of the Secretariat. The Rajpath, also known as the <font color="#556b2f">King's
Road</font>, extended from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan. On
Sansad Marg, parallel to the Rajpath, are the Secretariat building,
with two blocks flanking the Rashtrapati Bhawan and housing the
Government of India's ministries, and the Parliament House designed
by <font color="#6b8e23">Herbert Baker.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the south, land was acquired up
to Safdarjung's grave to create the area now known as the Lutyens
Bungalow area. Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of
<font color="#a9a9a9">Raisina Hill</font>, a circular railway line
(the Imperial Delhi Railway) was built around Council House (now
Parliament House) to transport building materials and workers for the
next <font color="#dcdcdc">twenty years.</font> The final stumbling
block was the Agra-Delhi railway line, which cut directly through the
area reserved for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial (India Gate)
and the Kingsway (Rajpath), a problem because the Old Delhi Railway
station served the entire city at the time. The line was shifted to
run along the Yamuna River and began operations in <font color="#2f4f4f">1924</font>.
The New Delhi Railway Station opened in 1926 at a single platform
near Ajmeri Gate in Paharganj, and was completed in time for the
city's inauguration in 1931. With the construction of the Viceroy's
House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan), the Central Secretariat, Parliament
House and the India Gate war memorial nearing completion,
construction of the commercial district and a new square, Connaught
Place, began in 1929 and was completed in <font color="#6b8e23">1933.</font>

grounds. For example, the pink-headed goose Anser brachyrhynchus

heat waves are formed only over land and these birds cannot maintain
active flight over long distances. The Mediterranean and other seas
are a major obstacle for migratory birds, which have to cross them at
the narrowest points. During migration periods, areas such as the
Straits of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo and the Bosphorus are
crossed by huge numbers of large birds of prey and herons. More
common species, such as the Bee-eater Pernis apivorus, can be counted
in the hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as
mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, especially for large

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Migratory birds may use two
electromagnetic devices to find their destination: <font color="#a9a9a9">one
is entirely innate and the other is based on experience</font>. On
its first migration journey, a young bird flies in the right
direction according to the Earth's magnetic field, but doesn't know
how far it is. It does this through a radical mechanism in which the
field affects the chemical reactions of specific light pigments
sensitive to long wavelengths. Although this only works during
daylight, it does not take advantage of the position of the sun in
any way. At this stage, the bird is like <font color="#dcdcdc">a boy
scout with a compass but no map, until </font>it gets used to the
journey and can use its other abilities. With experience, it learns
different landmarks, and this 'mapping' is done by the magnetites in
the trigeminal node, which tell the bird how strong the field is. As
birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the strengths of
magnetic fields at different latitudes allow it to interpret the
radical mechanism more accurately and <font color="#2f4f4f">indicate
when it has reached its destination. </font>There is a neural
connection <font color="#556b2f">between the eye and &quot;Cluster
N&quot;</font>, the <font color="#6b8e23">part of the forebrain that

built on the waterfront, including Brighton, Chelsea, Shelburne,
Ambassador, Ritz Carlton, Mayflower, Madison House and Breakers. The
Quaker-owned Chalfonte House, opened in 1868 , and the Haddon House,

Their original wood-frame buildings were expanded and even moved
closer to the beach over the years. The modern eight-story Chalfonte
Hotel opened in 1904. The modern Haddon Hall was built in phases and
completed in 1929 as an eleven-storey building. By then under the
same ownership, they were merged into the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall
Hotel, which became the largest hotel in the city with <font color="#556b2f">nearly
1,000 </font>rooms. In 1930, the Claridge, the city's last major
hotel before the casinos, opened its doors. The Claridge's 400-room
hotel was built by a partnership that included well-known
Philadelphia contractor John McShain. It had 24 floors and became

age. During Prohibition, which was introduced nationally in <font color="#2f4f4f">1933
</font>and lasted <font color="#2f4f4f">until 1933</font>, alcohol
was consumed in large quantities and gambling was regularly played in
the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants. During Prohibition, the
usurer and political boss Enoch L. &quot;Nucky&quot; Johnson rose to
power. Prohibition was rarely enforced in Atlantic City, and the easy
availability of alcohol smuggled into the city from restaurants and
other establishments, with the approval of local authorities, made
the resort even more popular. The city then called itself &quot;<font color="#556b2f">the
playground of the world</font>&quot;. Nucky Johnson's income, which
reached up to <font color="#6b8e23">$500 000 a year, came from

after World War II, Atlantic City was plagued by poverty, crime,
corruption and general economic decline in the mid- and late 20th
century. The district, known <font color="#a9a9a9">as the Inlet,
</font>became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's
decline were multilayered. First, the <font color="#dcdcdc">automobile
</font>became more readily available to many Americans after the war.
Atlantic City had originally relied on visitors coming by train and
staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as
they pleased, and many spent only a few days instead of weeks. The
emergence of suburbs also played a major role. As many families moved
into their own homes, luxuries such as <font color="#2f4f4f">air
conditioning and swimming pools </font>reduced their interest in
going to luxury beach resorts in the hot summer. Perhaps the biggest
factor in Atlantic City's decline in popularity, however, was the

However, the introduction of gambling did not quickly eliminate many

that it only exacerbated these problems, as evidenced by the stark
contrast between the tourist-intensive areas and the poor
working-class neighborhoods nearby. Moreover, Atlantic City has not
been as popular a gambling city in the US as Las Vegas. Donald Trump
helped bring big-name boxing matches to the city to attract customers
to his casinos. Boxer Mike Tyson held most of his fights in Atlantic
City in the 1980s, which helped Atlantic City gain national attention
as a gambling destination. Numerous high-rise condominiums were built
for use as permanent residences or second homes. By the end of the

in the 2000s, Atlantic City's tourism began to decline because it was
unable <font color="#a9a9a9">to diversify beyond gaming</font>. The
Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority was determined to expand, and
in 1999 the Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority partnered with Las
Vegas casino mogul <font color="#dcdcdc">Steve Wynn </font><font color="#2f4f4f">to
develop a new roadway </font>in a barren part of town near the
marina. Known as &quot;<font color="#556b2f">The Tunnel Project,&quot;
</font>Steve Wynn designed the proposed &quot;Mirage Atlantic City&quot;
around the idea of connecting a $330 million tunnel stretching 4.0
miles from the Atlantic City freeway to his new resort. The road was
later officially named <font color="#6b8e23">the Atlantic
City-Brigantine Connector, </font>and will divert inbound traffic off
the expressway to the city's marina area and into Brigantine, New
Jersey.</p>

hectares </font>(8.1 ha) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City
Hotel and Casino for a new $2 billion-plus casino resort. <font color="#2f4f4f">Revel

setback for the company coming in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley,
which owned <font color="#556b2f">90 percent of </font>Revel
Entertainment Group, decided to stop financing the continued
construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. In early 2010,
the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax
incentives to attract new investors and complete construction, but a
March 2010 poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind found
that three in five voters (60%) opposed the legislation and two in
three opposed it were &quot;strongly opposed&quot;. In the end,
<font color="#6b8e23">Governor Chris Christie </font>offered Revel
$261 million in state tax credits after the casino opened. By March
2011[update], Revel had completed all the exterior work and continued
work on the interior after finally obtaining the funding needed to
complete construction. It held a soft opening in April 2012 and was
fully open in May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, Revel
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after suffering severe losses and the
resort's value had dropped from $2.4 billion to $450 million. It was
restructured, but was still unable to continue operations and filed
for bankruptcy again on 19 June 2014. It was put up for sale, but as
no suitable offers were received, the resort closed its doors on 2
September 2014.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The body's ability to respond to an
antigen depends on <font color="#a9a9a9">the age of the person, the
type of antigen, maternal factors and the area </font>where the
antigen is present. Newborns are said to be physiologically
immunocompromised because <font color="#dcdcdc">both innate and
adaptive immunological responses are greatly attenuated.</font> After
birth, the infant's immune system responds positively to protein
antigens, but less well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Indeed,
many neonatal infections are caused by <font color="#2f4f4f">organisms
with low virulence, such as </font>Staphylococcus<font color="#2f4f4f">
and Pseudomonas.</font> Newborns have very limited opsonemic activity
and the ability to activate the complement cascade. For example, the
average C3 concentration of a newborn is about 65% of that of an
adult. Phagocytic activity is also significantly reduced in newborns.
This is due to lower opsonic activity and impaired up-regulation of
integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of
neutrophils to interact with endothelial adhesion molecules. Their
monocytes are slow and their ATP production is reduced, which also
limits the <font color="#556b2f">phagocytic </font>activity of the
neonate. Although the total number of lymphocytes is significantly
higher than in adults, cellular and humoral immunity is also
impaired. The ability of neonatal antigen-presenting cells to
<font color="#6b8e23">activate T cells </font>is impaired. Neonatal T
cells also proliferate poorly and produce very low levels of
cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12 and IFN-g, which limits
their ability to activate the humoral response and macrophage
phagocytosis. B cells develop early during pregnancy but are not

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Maternal
factors </font>also play a role in the body's immune response. At
birth, most of the immunoglobulin is maternal IgG. Since IgM, IgD,
IgE and IgA do not pass through the placenta, they are barely
detectable at birth. Some IgA is obtained <font color="#dcdcdc">from
breast milk. </font>These passively acquired antibodies can protect
the newborn for <font color="#2f4f4f">up to 18 months</font>, but
their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity. These
antibodies can also cause a negative response. If a child is exposed
to an antibody to a particular antigen before being exposed to the
antigen itself, the child will have a weakened response. Antibodies
passively acquired by the mother can suppress the antibody response
to active immunisation. Similarly, the T cell response to vaccination
is different in children than in adults, and vaccines that induce a
Th1 response in adults do not readily elicit the same responses in
newborns. Between six and nine months after birth, the child's immune
system begins to respond more strongly to <font color="#556b2f">glycoproteins,

significantly until the child is at least one year old. This may

sound inaudible. In <font color="#556b2f">1959, </font>Richard Ehmer

psychoacoustic masking codec </font>was first proposed in 1979,
apparently independently of each other, by Manfred R. Schroeder and
others from Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. (Murray Hill, NJ) and
M. A. Krasner (both in <font color="#dcdcdc">the USA)</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Krasner
</font>was the first to publish and manufacture hardware for speech
(which could not be used for bit compression of music), but the
publication of his results as a relatively unknown technical report
from the Lincoln Laboratory did not immediately influence the
mainstream of psychoacoustic codec development. Manfred Schroeder was
already a well-known and respected figure in the global community of
acoustic and electrical engineers, but his paper went largely
unnoticed because it described negative results due to the specific
nature of speech and the amplification of linear <font color="#556b2f">predictive
coding </font>(LPC) in speech. Both Krasner and Schroeder were based
on the work of Eberhard F. Zwicker on critical band tuning and
masking, which in turn was based on basic research by Harvey Fletcher
and his colleagues at Bell Labs. The IEEE refereed Journal on
Selected Areas in Communications reported on many different (mostly
perceptual) sound<font color="#6b8e23"> compression algorithms.</font>
That journal reported in February 1988 on a number of
well-established and working audio bit compression techniques, some
of which used auditory masking as part of the basic design, and
several of which presented real-time hardware implementations.</p>

recording of Suzanne Vega's song &quot;Tom's Diner&quot; to evaluate
and refine <font color="#dcdcdc">the MP3 compression algorithm</font>.
This song was chosen because it is almost <font color="#2f4f4f">monophonic

the imperfections in the compression during playback. Some call
Suzanne Vega the &quot;<font color="#556b2f">mother of MP3&quot;</font>.
This track has the interesting feature that both channels are almost,
but not quite, the same, leading to a case where Binaural Masking
Level Depression causes spatial masking of noise artifacts unless the
encoder correctly identifies the situation and applies corrections
similar to those presented in the MPEG-2 AAC psychoacoustic model.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">House music is a genre of <font color="#a9a9a9">electronic
dance music that </font>originated in <font color="#dcdcdc">Chicago
in the </font>early <font color="#2f4f4f">1980s</font>. It originally
became popular <font color="#556b2f">in Chicago </font>around 1984.
House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit,
New York and Newark, which all developed their own regional scenes.
In the mid to late <font color="#a0522d">1980s, </font>house music
became popular in Europe, as well as in major cities in South America
and Australia. The early commercial success of house music in Europe
was reflected in pop charts such as MARRS's <font color="#228b22">&quot;Pump
Up The Volume&quot; </font>(1987), House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy
of House's &quot;House Nation&quot; (1987), S'Express's &quot;Theme
from S'Express&quot; (1988) and Coldcut's &quot;Doctorin' the House&quot;
(1988). Since the early and mid-1990s, house music has seeped into
mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Early house music was generally
<font color="#a9a9a9">dance-based music, </font>characterised by
repetitive <font color="#dcdcdc">4/4 beats</font>, rhythms produced
mainly by <font color="#2f4f4f">drum machines</font>, off-beat hi-hat
cymbals and synthesised bass lines. Although house music had many of
the characteristics of disco music, <font color="#556b2f">it was more
electronic and minimalist, with the </font>repetitive rhythm taking
precedence over the song itself. While house music of the 2010s
retains many of these key elements, particularly the kick drum that
appears in every beat, it varies greatly in style and influence, from
soulful and atmospheric deep house to more minimalist micro house.
House music has also fused with many other genres, creating fusion
subgenres such as <font color="#6b8e23">euro house, tech house,
electro house and jump house.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 1980s, many local
Chicago house artists suddenly landed major record label deals. House
music proved to be a commercially successful genre, and the <font color="#a9a9a9">more

and bands such as Madonna, Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, Aretha
Franklin</font>, Bananarama, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Whitney
Houston, Steps, Kylie Minogue, Björk and C+C Music Factory have all
incorporated the genre into some of their work. After enjoying
considerable success in the early and mid-90s, house music grew even
further during the second wave of progressive house (<font color="#2f4f4f">1999-2001)</font>.
The genre has remained popular and merged with other popular
subgenres such as <font color="#556b2f">G-house, deep house, tech
house and bass house. </font>As of 2015, house music continues to be
very popular in <font color="#6b8e23">both the club and mainstream

experiments by Chicago artists using a blaring Roland TB-303 bass
synthesizer, and the genesis of the style on vinyl is commonly cited
in Phuture's &quot;Acid Tracks&quot; (<font color="#a9a9a9">1987</font>).

stores like Importes, State Street Records, Loop Records, Gramaphone
Records, and the popular Hot Mix 5 programs <font color="#a9a9a9">on

with the genre. <font color="#dcdcdc">Trax Records and DJ
International Records</font>, Chicago record labels with wider
distribution, helped popularize house music in Chicago and beyond. A
1986 house music song by Marshall Jefferson called<font color="#2f4f4f">
&quot;Move Your Body&quot;, </font>from the aptly named &quot;The
House Music Anthem&quot; EP, became a big hit in Chicago and
eventually worldwide. By 1986, <font color="#556b2f">British </font>record
labels were releasing house music by Chicago artists, and by 1987,
house songs by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing and topping

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The term &quot;house music&quot; is
said to have originated in a <font color="#a9a9a9">Chicago </font>club
called<font color="#dcdcdc"> The Warehouse, which </font>operated
from <font color="#2f4f4f">1977 to 1983</font>. The Warehouse's
clubgoers were <font color="#556b2f">mainly black and gay, who </font>came
to dance to the music played by the club's resident DJ <font color="#6b8e23">Frankie
Knuckles</font>, who fans call the 'godfather of house'. After the
Warehouse closed in 1983, the crowd moved to Knuckles' new club, The
Power Plant. In Channel 4's Pump Up The Volume documentary, Knuckles
points out that he first heard the term 'house music' when he saw the
words 'we play house music' on a sign in the window of a bar on
Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car with him joked,
&quot;You know, that's the kind of music they play <font color="#a0522d">in
the Warehouse</font>!&quot; and then everyone laughed. South-Side
Chicago DJ Leonard &quot;Remix&quot; Roy claims in his self-published
statements that he put such a sign in the window of the pub because
he played music there that could be found at home; in his case, the
sign referred to his mother's soul and disco records that she used in
her sets. Farley Jackmaster Funk is quoted as saying: 'In 1982 I was
DJing at a club called The Playground and there was a boy called
Leonard 'Remix' Roy who was DJing at a rival club called The Rink. He
came to my club one night in the DJ booth and said to me: 'I've got a
trick that will take all the people out of your club and into mine -
it's called House music'. I don't know where he got that name or what
made him come up with it, so the answer is him.&quot;</p>

number five on the Billboard Club Chart and was the first house album
by a white artist to chart in the US. Dada Nada, which was Ozn's solo

Frankie Knuckles and David Morales remixing Dada Nada's &quot;Deep
Love&quot; (<font color="#228b22">One Voice Records/USA</font>,

a number of new house music sounds. Sweden knew <font color="#a9a9a9">snare-less
</font>&quot;Swedish progressive house&quot; prominence with
Sebastian Ingrosso, Axwell, Steve Angello (these three formed a trio
called <font color="#dcdcdc">Swedish House Mafia</font>), Avicii,
Alesso, etc. In the Netherlands, the concept of &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">Dirty
Dutch&quot;</font>, a sub-genre of electro house characterised by
very abrasive leads and darker arpeggios, was born, and its most
famous DJs include Chuckie, Hardwell, Laidback Luke, Afrojack, R3hab,
Bingo Players, Quintino, Alvaro, Cedric Gervais, 2G, etc. Elsewhere,
fusion genres derived from the progressive house of the 2000s
returned to prominence, notably through DJs Calvin Harris, Eric
Prydz, Mat Zo, Above &amp; Beyond and Fonzerell in Europe and
Deadmau5, Kaskade, Steve Aoki, Porter Robinson and Wolfgang Gartner
in the US and Canada. The growing popularity of such artists led to
the emergence of sounds mixed with electro house and progressive
house in popular music, such as <font color="#556b2f">Lady </font>Gaga's
&quot;Marry the Night&quot;, The Black Eyed Peas' &quot;The Best One
Yet (The Boy)&quot; and will.i.am and Britney Spears' &quot;Scream &amp;

instant messaging or handwritten notebooks, this is not necessarily a
disadvantage, but it is because its users do not usually expect it to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, for publication titles, it
is common typographic practice for both British and US publishers to
capitalise important words (and in the US this is often applied <font color="#a9a9a9">to

usually referred to as the <font color="#dcdcdc">title case</font>.
For example, <font color="#2f4f4f">R. M. Ritter's Oxford Manual of
Style </font>(2002) suggests that 'the first word and all nouns,
pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs are capitalised, but not
usually articles, conjunctions and short prepositions'. This is an
old accent, similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or
bold font for headings. The rules about which words to capitalise are
not based on any grammatically inherent distinction between right and
wrong, <font color="#556b2f">nor are they universally standardised</font>;
they are arbitrary and vary from one style guide to another, although

Hidalgo gained great support among intellectuals, liberal priests and

indigenous people. He set out on a march towards the capital Mexico
City, but retreated back north when he encountered the elite royal
troops on the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal
government in Guadalajara, Jalisco, but was soon forced to flee north
by the royal troops who had retaken the city. Hidalgo tried to reach
<font color="#556b2f">the United States </font>and gain American
support for Mexican independence. HIdalgo reached Saltillo, Coahuila,
where he publicly resigned his military commission and rejected an
amnesty offered by Viceroy Francisco Venegas in exchange for
Hidalgo's surrender. Shortly afterwards, he and his supporters were
captured by King <font color="#6b8e23">Ignacio Elizondo </font>at the
Norias de Baján (Baján Springs) on 21 March 1811 and taken to the
city of Chihuahua. Hidalgo forced the Bishop of Valladolid, Manuel
Abad y Queipo, to revoke the excommunication order issued against him
on 24 September 1810. Later, on 13 October 1810, the Inquisition
issued an excommunication edict condemning Miguel Hidalgo as a rebel,

Orozco's rebellion. The governor of Chihuahua mobilised the state
militia, led by Colonel Pancho Villa, to supplement General Huerta.
By June, <font color="#dcdcdc">Villa </font>informed Huerta that the
Orozco rebellion had been defeated and that the militia no longer
considered itself under Huerta's command and would leave. Huerta was
furious and ordered Villa's execution. Madero's brother <font color="#2f4f4f">Raúl
Madero </font>intervened to save Villa's life. Imprisoned in Mexico,
Villa fled to the United States. Madero's time as leader was cut

sided with <font color="#556b2f">Huerta </font>and Huerta made him

considered the father of the nation, although it was <font color="#dcdcdc">Agustin
de Iturbide, </font>not Hidalgo, who achieved Mexican independence in
1821. Shortly after independence, its celebrations alternated between
16 September, Hidalgo's Grito Day, and 27 September, when Iturbide
rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later political movements
favoured the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so
eventually <font color="#2f4f4f">16 September 1810 </font>became
officially recognised as Mexico's Independence Day. The reason for
this is that Hidalgo is considered to be the 'forerunner and creator
of the other heroes of the (Mexican) War of Independence'. Hidalgo
has become an icon for Mexicans resisting tyranny in the country.
<font color="#556b2f">Diego Rivera </font>painted Hidalgo's image on
half a dozen murals. José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a
flaming torch of freedom and considered the painting one of his best
works. The University of San Nicolas in Morelia commissioned David
Alfaro Siqueiros to paint a mural for the 200th anniversary of
Hidalgo's birth. The town of her parish was named Dolores Hidalgo in
her honour, and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year
on the night of 15-16 September, the President of Mexico re-enacts
Grito from the balcony of the National Palace. The leaders of cities
and municipalities across Mexico re-enact this scene. The remains of
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla are located on the Angel of Independence
column <font color="#6b8e23">in Mexico City.</font> Next to it is a
lamp lit to represent the sacrifices of those who gave their lives
for Mexico's independence.</p>

The battle ended quickly due to devastating defensive mistakes by

successful liberal leaders José María Patoni and Chihuahua's J.E.
Muñoz quickly consolidated their positions by restricting the

<font color="#a9a9a9">Coahuila and Durango</font>, he prepared to
invade the state of <font color="#dcdcdc">Chihuahua</font>. On 8 July
1865, Brincourt crossed the Nazas River in northern Durango and
headed for Chihuahua. On 22 July, Brincourt crossed the banks of the
Río Florido to Ciudad Jiménez; a day later he arrived in Valle de
Allende, where he sent Colonel Pyot with a garrison to take Hidalgo
del Parral. Brincourt continued his journey via Santa Rosalia de
Camargo and Santa Cruz de Rosales. <font color="#2f4f4f">President
Juárez </font>remained in the state capital until 5 August 1865,
when he left for El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Juárez) because there
was evidence that the French intended to invade the city. On the same
day, the President appointed General Manuel Ojinaga as the new
governor and put him in charge of all Republican forces. At the same
time, <font color="#556b2f">General Villagran </font>surprised the
Imperial troops held by Hidalgo de Parral; after a short two-hour
battle, Colonel Pyot was defeated and forced to retreat. In the
battle of Parral, the French lost 55 men to the Republican troops. On
13 August 1865, French troops, estimated at 2 500 men, arrived on the
outskirts of Chihuahua City, and on 15 August 1865, General Brincourt
defeated the Republican forces and took control of the state capital.
Brincourt appointed Tomás Zuloaga as prefect of Chihuahua. Fearing
that the French would continue their campaign in El Paso del Norte,
President Juárez moved in August 1865 to El Carrizal, a remote
location in the mountains near El Paso del Norte. It would have been
easy for French troops to continue their pursuit of President Juárez
across the border, but they feared clashes with American troops.
General François Achille Bazaine ordered the French troops to
withdraw back to Durango State, having reached the state only a day's
journey north of Chihuahua City. General Brincourt asked to be left
with 1,000 men to help maintain control of the state, but his request
was denied. After General Ojinaga's death, the Republican government
declared <font color="#6b8e23">General Villagran </font>to lead the
fight against the imperial troops. The French left the state on 29
October 1865. President Juárez returned to Chihuahua City on 20
November 1865 and remained in the city until 9 December 1865, when he
returned to El Paso del Norte. Shortly after the President left
Chihuahua City, Terrazas was reinstated as Governor of the State on

Patriot Battalion, which was sent to fight in the Battle of Matamoros
in Tamaulipas against the French. After several major defeats and a
growing Prussian threat, France began withdrawing its troops from
Mexico in late 1866. Disillusioned with Maximilian's liberal
political views, Mexican conservatives abandoned him, and in 1867 the
last of the Emperor's forces were defeated. A military tribunal

President Juárez faced another crisis; the Juárez administration
was suspected of involvement in the assassination of the military
commander José María Paton, executed by General Canto, in August

to Donato Guerra. Canto was sentenced to death, but his sentence was
later commuted to 10 years' imprisonment. In 1869, a sense of
injustice sparked a new rebellion that threatened the federal
government. In response, the Juárez administration took drastic
action by temporarily suspending constitutional rights, but the
governor of Chihuahua did not support this measure. Hostilities
continued to increase, especially after the <font color="#6b8e23">1871
</font>elections, which were perceived as fraudulent. A new popular
leader, Porfirio Díaz, emerged among the rebels. The federal
government succeeded in suppressing the rebellions in Durango and
Chihuahua. On 18 July 1872, President Juárez died of a heart attack;
soon afterwards, many of his supporters stopped fighting. Peace
returned to Chihuahua, and the new government was led by Governor
Antonio Ochoa (former co-owner of the Batopilas silver mines) in

among wealthy17 families, who owned virtually all the arable land in
Chihuahua. The state's economy grew rapidly under Porfiriato;
<font color="#2f4f4f">Chihuahua's </font>economy was dominated by
agriculture and mining. The Díaz administration helped Governor Luis
Terrazas by funding the Chihuahua City Municipal Public Library and
by approving a federal initiative to build a railroad from Chihuahua
City to Ciudad Júarez. By 1881, the Central Mexico Railroad was
completed, linking Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez. In 1883, <font color="#556b2f">telephone
lines </font>were installed throughout the state, allowing
communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888, telephone
services had been extended from the capital to the towns of Julimes,
Meoqui and Hidalgo del Parral; the state's telecommunications network
covered an estimated 3 500 km. The need for labour to build large
infrastructure projects led to significant Asian immigration, mainly
from China. Asian immigrants soon became an integral part of the
state's economy, opening <font color="#6b8e23">restaurants, small
grocery stores and hotels.</font> By the end of Terrazas's term, the

areas and common at higher altitudes. The Sierra Madre Occidental has
several catchment areas from which all water flows through the state;
most rivers eventually flow into the Río Grande. In some canyons of
the state, temperatures reach over 100°C in summer, while in winter
temperatures rarely fall below 32°C in the same areas. In the heart
of the Sierra Madre Occidental, the state's microclimate can be
considered tropical, and wild <font color="#6b8e23">tropical </font>plants
have been found in some canyons. La Barranca del Cobre, or Copper
Canyon, is a magnificent canyon system, larger and deeper than the
Grand Canyon; it also contains Mexico's two highest waterfalls: the
Basaseachic Falls and the Piedra Volada. The state's mountainous
region is home to two national parks: the Cumbres de Majalca National
Park and the Basaseachic Falls National Park.</p>

tuning systems. In the West, the <font color="#a9a9a9">twelve-tone

temperament scale is the most commonly used method for tuning this
scale today. The pitch ratio between two consecutive notes of the
scale is exactly <font color="#dcdcdc">one-twelfth of two </font>(i.e.
approximately 1.05946). In well-tempered systems (such as those used
in the time of Johann Sebastian Bach), different tuning methods were
used. Almost all of these systems share a single interval, the
<font color="#2f4f4f">octave</font>, in which the pitch of one note
is twice the frequency of the other. For example, if the A above the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to the American National
Standards Institute, pitch is an auditory property of <font color="#a9a9a9">sound
that </font>allows sounds to be ordered on a scale from low to high.
Since pitch is the close equivalent of <font color="#dcdcdc">frequency</font>,
it is determined almost exclusively by how fast a sound wave causes
air to vibrate, and has little to do with the amplitude of the wave.
In other words, a 'high' pitch means a very <font color="#2f4f4f">fast
</font>vibration and a 'low' pitch corresponds to a <font color="#556b2f">slower
</font>vibration. Despite this, most languages use the same idiom of
associating vertical height with pitch. In English, at least, it is
just one of many profound conceptual metaphors involving up/down. The
precise etymological history of the musical meaning of high and low
pitch remains unclear. There is evidence that people actually
perceive the source of a sound to be slightly higher or lower in a
vertical space when the frequency of the sound is raised or lowered.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Temporal theories offer an
alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action
potentials, mainly the phase and mode locking of action potentials to
stimulus frequencies. The precise way in which this temporal
structure helps to encode pitch at higher levels is still
controversial, but the treatment seems to rely on <font color="#a9a9a9">the
autocorrelation of action potentials in the auditory nerve.</font>
However, it has long been noted that no neural mechanism has been
found to implement the delay - a necessary function for true
autocorrelation. At least one model suggests that a temporal delay is
<font color="#dcdcdc">unnecessary </font>to produce an
autocorrelation model of pitch perception, and relies on phase
transitions between cochlear filters; however, previous work has
shown that certain sounds with a significant peak in the
autocorrelation function do not induce a corresponding pitch
perception, and that certain sounds without a peak in the
autocorrelation function do induce a pitch perception. To be a more
comprehensive model, autocorrelation must therefore be applied to
signals representing the output of the inner ear, such as the
intervals between auditory nerve spikes - histograms. According to
some theories of pitch perception, pitch is inherently associated
with octave <font color="#2f4f4f">ambiguities, and is </font>therefore
best divided into pitch chroma, which is a periodic value around an
octave, such as the names of musical notes in Western music, and
pitch chroma, which can be ambiguous and indicates the octave in
which the pitch is located.</p>

Texas slaves came with their owners from older <font color="#8b0000">slave

domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the centre of this trade in the
Deep South, but Houston had slave traders. Thousands of enslaved
African Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of
them worked on sugar and cotton plantations near the city, while most
within the city limits worked in domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860,
<font color="#483d8b">49% of </font>the city's population were
slaves. A few slaves, perhaps as many between <font color="#3cb371">2,0001835

Texas grew rapidly as settlers poured into the state's cotton lands.
They brought with them or bought enslaved African Americans, whose

1850 and 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although <font color="#a9a9a9">Houston
</font>is the largest city in the US without formal zoning
regulations, it has developed in a similar way to other Sun Belt
cities because the city's land use regulations and legal agreements

lot sizes </font>for single-family homes and requirements that
parking spaces be available for tenants and customers. Such
restrictions have had mixed results. While some have blamed these
