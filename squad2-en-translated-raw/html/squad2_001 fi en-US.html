<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Buddhist schools differ in the exact
nature of the path to liberation, the meaning and canonicity of the
various teachings and scriptures, and especially in their practices.
Buddhism denies the existence of a creator deity and claims that
earthly deities such as Mahabrahma are wrongly regarded as creators.
Buddhist tradition and practice is based on three jewels: <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Buddha, the Dharma (teachings) and the Sangha (community).</font>
&quot;Taking refuge in the triple jewel&quot; has traditionally been
a declaration and commitment to walk the Buddhist path, and generally
distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices include
the <font color="#2f4f4f">Ten Meritorious Acts</font>, which include
giving charity to reduce <font color="#556b2f">greed</font>,
observing ethical rules, <font color="#6b8e23">renouncing ordinary
life and becoming a monk</font>, developing mindfulness and
practicing meditation, <font color="#a0522d">cultivating higher
wisdom and discernment</font>, studying scriptures, devotions,

inviting Buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Mahayana Buddhism received its
important theoretical foundation from Nagarjuna (perhaps c. 150-250
AD), who is probably the most influential scholar in the Mahayana
tradition. Nagarjuna's primary contribution to Buddhist philosophy
was the systematic introduction of the concept of <font color="#a9a9a9">śūnyatā
</font>or '<font color="#dcdcdc">emptiness', which is </font>widely
attested in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras of his time. The concept of
emptiness combines with other key Buddhist doctrines, especially
anatta and dependent origination, to refute the metaphysics of
Sarvastivadha and Sautrantika (the dead non-mahayana school). For
Nagarjuna, sentient beings alone are not void of ātman; all
<font color="#556b2f">phenomena </font>(dharmas) are devoid of
svabhava (literally &quot;self-nature&quot; or &quot;self-nature&quot;)
and thus devoid of any ultimate essence; they are &quot;void&quot; of
independent being; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava that were
circulating at the time were refuted by the doctrines of early
Buddhism. The Nagarjuna school is known as the Mādhyamaka. Some
writings associated with Nagarjuna explicitly referred to the
Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the limits set
by the agamas. He may have arrived at his positions out of a desire
for a coherent exegesis of the Buddha's teachings as recorded in the
canon. In Nagarjuna's eyes, the Buddha was not only a pioneer but the
founder of the Mādhyamaka system itself.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In addition to emptiness, Mahayana
schools often emphasize the concepts of <font color="#a9a9a9">perfect
spiritual realization </font>(prajñāpāramitā) and <font color="#dcdcdc">Buddha-nature
</font>(<font color="#2f4f4f">tathāgatagarbha)</font>. In Mahāyāna
thought, there are conflicting interpretations of tathāgatagarbha.
The idea can be traced back to Abhidharma and ultimately to the
Buddha's statements in the Nikāya. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to
the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the
mind's clarity and emptiness. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also
refers to the inseparability of the mind's brightness and emptiness
in general. According to the Gelug school, it means the possibility
of sentient beings awakening because they are empty (i.e.,
dependently arising). According to the <font color="#6b8e23">Jonang
</font>school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that
manifest as omniscience, etc. when random obscurations are removed.
The &quot;Tathāgatagarbha-sutras&quot; are a collection of Mahayana
sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature. Although this
collection was generally ignored in India, East Asian Buddhism gives
these texts some significance.</p>

fundamental themes: transforming the mind and using it to explore the
self and other phenomena. According to Theravada Buddhism, the Buddha
taught two types of meditation, samatha meditation (śamatha in
Sanskrit) and vipassanā meditation (vipaśyanā in Sanskrit). In
Chinese Buddhism, these exist (translated as chih kuan), but chán
meditation (zen meditation) is more popular. According to Peter
Harvey, whenever Buddhism has been healthy, meditation has been
practised not only by monks, nuns and married lamas, but also by more
committed lay people. By contrast, according to Routledge's
Encyclopedia of Buddhism, for most of the history of Buddhism before
modern times, serious meditation by lay people was unusual. Evidence
from early texts suggests that in the Buddha's time many male and
female lay people practised meditation, some even to the point of

that a practitioner can achieve Buddhism in one lifetime or even in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Historically, Buddhism has its roots
in the religious thought of ancient India in the <font color="#a9a9a9">second
half of the first millennium BC.</font> It was a time of social and
religious upheaval, as the sacrifices and rituals of Vedic Brahmanism
aroused considerable discontent[note 15] and was challenged by
numerous new ascetic religious and philosophical groups and teachings
that broke away from the Brahmanic tradition and rejected the
authority of the Vedas and Brahmans. 16] These groups, whose members
were known as <font color="#dcdcdc">shramanas</font>, were a
continuation of a <font color="#2f4f4f">non-Vedic </font>Indian
school of thought separate from Indo-Aryan Brahmanism. 17] Scholars
have reason to believe that ideas such as samsara, karma (in the
sense that morality affects rebirth) and moksha originated <font color="#556b2f">with
the shramanas and were </font>later adopted by Brahmin orthodoxy[note
18][note 19][note 20][note 21][note 22][note 23].</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This view is supported by research
into the area in which these perceptions have emerged. Buddhism arose
in <font color="#a9a9a9">Greater Magadha</font>, which stretched from
Sravast, the capital of Kosala in the northwest, to <font color="#dcdcdc">Rajagrha
</font>in the southeast. This land, located east of Aryavarta, the
land of the Aryans, was recognized as non-Vedic. Other Vedic texts
reveal a dislike for the people of Magadha, most probably because the
Magadhas were not Brahmanised at that time. It was not until the <font color="#2f4f4f">2nd
or 3rd century </font>BC that the spread of Brahmanism eastwards to
Greater Magadha became significant. The ideas that had developed in
Greater Magadha before this time were not under the influence of the
Vedas. These include rebirth and karmic retribution, which appear in
many Greater Magadha movements, including Buddhism. These movements
inherited the concepts of rebirth and karmic retribution from an
earlier culture[citation needed].</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At the same time, these movements
were influenced by and in some respects continued the philosophical
thinking of the Vedic tradition, as expressed in <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Upanishads</font>. In addition to Buddhism, these movements included
various sceptics (such as Sanjaya Belatthiputta), atomists (such as
<font color="#dcdcdc">Pakudha Kaccayana</font>), materialists (such
as Ajita Kesakambali), antinomists (such as Purana Kassapa); the most

(materialists), the <font color="#2f4f4f">Ajnanas </font>(agnostics)
and the <font color="#556b2f">Jains, </font>who stressed the need to
free the soul from matter. Many of these new movements shared the
same conceptual vocabulary - atman ('self'), buddha ('awakened'),
dhamma ('rule' or 'law'), karma ('action'), nirvana ('exhaustion'),
samsara ('eternal recurrence') and yoga ('spiritual practice').[Note
24] The Shramanas rejected the authority of the Vedas and the
Brahmans, who claimed to possess revealed truths that could not be
known by ordinary human means. They further declared that the whole
Brahmanical system was fraudulent: a conspiracy of Brahmins to enrich
themselves by charging exorbitant fees for engaging in bogus disputes

the power to see with divine eyes. Naming the Vedic rishis, he
declared that some brahmins who introduced <font color="#2f4f4f">animal

Veda that he refused to honour the <font color="#556b2f">Vedas of </font>his

idea of the union of the self with the Self. At the same time,

almost all scholars. Its most important scriptures are the Vinaya
Pitaka and the four most important Nikayas or Agamas. Certain basic
teachings appear in many places in the early texts, so most scholars
conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to
the three signs of existence, the five aggregates, dependent
origination, karma and <font color="#dcdcdc">rebirth</font>, the four

after Gautama Buddha's Parinirvāṇa (Sanskrit for &quot;supreme

was held. As in all ancient Indian traditions, the teaching was
transmitted orally. The primary purpose of the meeting was to recite
the teachings collectively, to ensure that no mistakes were made in
the oral transmission. In the first council, Ānanda, the Buddha's
cousin and his personal assistant, was invited to recite the Buddha's
discourses (<font color="#2f4f4f">sūtras</font>, Pāli suttas) and,
according to some sources, the <font color="#556b2f">abhidhamma</font>.
Upāli, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (vinaya). Most
scholars consider the traditional accounts of the council to be
greatly exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. 36. Richard Gombrich
stated in the Sangiti Sutta (Digha Nikaya #33) that Sariputta led a
communal recitation of the Buddha's teachings for the preservation of
the Buddha's lifetime, and something like the first council must have
taken place to produce the Buddhist scriptures.</p>

This contradicts the <font color="#dcdcdc">Mahasanghika'</font>s own

Therefore, the seven Abhidharma texts are generally claimed to

own version of the Abhidharma, with different theories and different

the Mahayana scriptures were composed from the 1st century AD
onwards: 'Mahayana sutras were written in abundance between the
beginning of the common era and the 5th century AD', five centuries
after the historical Gautama Buddha. Some of them had their roots in
other writings from the 1st century BC. &quot;But outside the texts,
at least in India, at exactly the same time, very different - in fact
seemingly older - ideas and aspirations seem to motivate actual
behaviour, and the old and established Hinnayana groups seem to be
the only ones patronised and supported.&quot; These texts were
apparently not generally accepted among Indian Buddhists when they
appeared; the derogatory label <font color="#dcdcdc">Hinayana </font>was

which lasted thirteen weeks. Each finalist performs songs based on a
weekly theme, which can be a musical genre such as Motown, disco or
big band, songs by artists like Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The
Beatles, or more general themes such as Billboard number one hits or
songs from the contestant's birth year. Contestants usually work with
a celebrity mentor related to the theme. For the tenth season, <font color="#6b8e23">Jimmy
Iovine </font>was chosen as the mentor. Initially, contestants sing
one song each week, but this is increased to two songs from the <font color="#a0522d">top
four or five </font>and then to three songs for the top two or three.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The most popular competitors are not
usually revealed in the results broadcast. Instead, the three
contestants (two in later rounds) who received the fewest votes are
usually invited to the centre of the stage. One of these three is
usually sent to <font color="#a9a9a9">safety</font>; however, the
remaining two are not necessarily the last two. The contestant with
the fewest votes is revealed and eliminated from the competition. The
eliminated contestant is shown a montage of his time and gives his
final performance. However, in <font color="#dcdcdc">season six</font>,
the first episode of Idol Gives Back, no contestant was eliminated,
but the following week two contestants were sent home. In addition,

In the eighth, ninth, tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double
elimination took place in the week following the activation of the
'save', while in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a single
elimination took place. The twelfth period was not activated, so the
week following its expiry, there was a no-drop and the votes were

Southerners in Idol have included: a more diverse range of musical
genres because of the variety of musical styles in the Southern
states; fewer opportunities to enter the pop music business in the
South; text message voting because the South has the highest number
of cell phone-only households; and a strong music and singing

described as a &quot;sadistic musical baking contest&quot; and a &quot;joy

criticism. In particular, the show's product placement was pointed

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The term &quot;domestic dog&quot; is
commonly used for both domestic and wild dogs. The English word dog
comes from the Central European word dogge, which is derived from the
<font color="#a9a9a9">Old English </font>word docga, meaning &quot;a
strong breed of dog&quot;. The term may possibly derive from the
Proto-Germanic *dukkōn, represented by the Old English finger-docce.
The word also contains the familiar pet name diminutive -ga, which
also appears in frogga 'frog', picga 'pig', stagga 'deer', wicga
'beetle, worm', among others. The term dog may ultimately derive from
the earliest layer of <font color="#2f4f4f">Proto-Indo-European
</font>vocabulary.</p>

</font>(from Old English: hund) was a common word for all

believed that this type of 'dog' was so common that it eventually
became the prototype for the 'hound' category. By the <font color="#556b2f">1500s,

the taxonomist <font color="#dcdcdc">Linnaeus </font>published his
Systema Naturae, a classification of species that included the Canis
species. Canis is the Latin word for dog, and the list included
dog-like carnivores: the domestic dog, the wolf, the fox and the
jackal. The dog was classified as Canis familiaris, which means
'family of dogs' or <font color="#556b2f">family dog. </font>On the
next page, he recorded the <font color="#6b8e23">wolf </font>as <font color="#a0522d">Canis
lupus, </font>meaning 'dog-wolf'. In a 1978 review aimed at reducing
the number of recognised Canis species, it was suggested that '<font color="#228b22">Canis
dingo is </font>now generally regarded as a kind of feral domestic
dog. The name Canis familiaris is used for domestic dogs, although
taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with Canis lupus.&quot;
In 1982, the first edition of <font color="#8b0000">Mammal Species of
the World </font>listed Canis familiaris under Canis lupus with the
comment, &quot;Probably an ancestor of and related to the domestic
dog (lusis familiaris). Canis familiaris has a lateral precedence
over Canis lupus, but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus
(1758), and Canis lupus has been commonly used for this species',
which avoided the classification of the wolf as a dog genus. The dog
is now listed among many other Latin-named Canis lupus subspecies as
Canis lupus familiaris.</p>

Domestic dogs can be clearly distinguished from wolves by red cell

wolves are large, convex and almost spherical, whereas those of dogs
are smaller, compressed and slightly wrinkled. Dogs generally have a
20% smaller skull and 30% smaller brain than wolves of the same size.
35 Grey wolf teeth are also proportionally larger than those of dogs;
wolf premolars and molars are much less crowded and have more complex
tooth tip patterns. Wolves do not have claws on their hind legs,
unless they are mixed with dogs. Dogs do not have a functioning
precaudal gland, and most come into estrus twice a year, unlike gray
wolves where it only happens <font color="#2f4f4f">once a year.</font>
Dogs need fewer calories to function than wolves. A dog's lame ears
may be due <font color="#556b2f">to atrophy of the jaw muscles.</font>
The skin of domestic dogs is generally thicker than that of wolves,

describe their pet as <font color="#a9a9a9">part of their family</font>,
although the popular re-conceptualisation of the dog-human family as
a pack highlights some of the ambiguity in the relationship. Some dog
trainers, such as those featured on <font color="#dcdcdc">Dog
Whisperer, </font>have promoted a dominance model of the dog-human
relationship. However, it has been denied that 'status seeking' is a
characteristic of dog-human interaction. Pet dogs play an active role
in family life; for example, a study of dog-human family
conversations showed how family members use the dog as a resource,
talk to the dog or talk through the dog when mediating interactions
with each other.</p>

pets. For example, in the presence of a pet dog, people show a
reduction in cardiovascular disease, behavioural and psychological
<font color="#a9a9a9">distress indicators. </font>Other health
benefits come from exposure to <font color="#dcdcdc">immunity-stimulating

protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of
socialising with a dog include social support, as dogs can not only
provide companionship and social support themselves, but also act as
facilitators of <font color="#2f4f4f">social interactions </font>between
people. One study found that wheelchair users experience more

was also called for to be extended to French luxury and cosmetics
products. However, according to the Washington Times, on 15 April the

French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities such as

French state of separatist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some
burned French flags, some added a Nazi swastika <font color="#6b8e23">to
the French flag </font>and circulated short online messages calling
for large demonstrations in front of French consulates and embassies.
Protesters against the Carrefour boycott demanded access to a

carrying large Chinese flags and hit with water bottles. According to

 Great Britain: On <font color="#dcdcdc">6
April, the </font><br/>
torch relay in <font color="#a9a9a9">London</font>,
the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics, started <font color="#2f4f4f">at
Wembley Stadium</font>, travelled through the city of London and
ended at the <font color="#556b2f">O2 Arena</font> in the east of the
city. The 48-kilometre (<font color="#6b8e23">30-mile) </font>journey
took a total of seven and a half hours and provoked protests by
supporters of Tibetan independence and human rights, prompting a
change of planned route and an unscheduled change to a bus, which was
briefly stopped by the protesters. Home Affairs Minister Jacqui Smith
has formally complained to the Beijing Organising Committee about the
behaviour of Chinese security guards in sweatpants. Both the Mayor of
London, Ken Livingstone, and the Chairman of the London Olympic
Committee, Lord Coe, described the Chinese officials who assaulted
the protesters as &quot;<font color="#a0522d">thugs</font>&quot;. A
Metropolitan Police briefing paper revealed that the cost of security
for the torch relay was <font color="#228b22">£750 000 </font>and
that the involvement of Chinese security had been agreed in advance,
although the Mayor said: 'We did not know in advance that these thugs
were from the security service. If we had known, we would have said
no.&quot;</p>

Ladbroke Grove, </font>a protester tried to snatch the flare from
Konnie Huq during a momentary struggle, and in another incident a
fire extinguisher was set off near the flare. The Chinese ambassador
carried the torch through Chinatown after the route was changed
unannounced due to security concerns. The torch was unplanned to be
transferred to a bus along Fleet Street due to security concerns and
attempts by protesters to avoid it. In an effort to protest against
the Tibet protesters and show support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics,
more than 2,000 Chinese people gathered along the route of the torch
and demonstrated with signs, banners and Chinese flags. Large crowds
of supporters were concentrated in Trafalgar Square, where the
Olympic slogan &quot;One World, One Dream&quot; was displayed.</p>

 France: it started at the
first level of <font color="#556b2f">the Eiffel Tower </font>and
ended at the Stade Charléty stadium<font color="#dcdcdc">.</font>
Originally planned to be 28 kilometres long, it was shortened at the
request of the Chinese authorities after widespread protests by
pro-Tibet and human rights activists who repeatedly tried to disrupt,
block or stop the procession. A planned ceremony at the town hall was
cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and also at the
request of the Chinese authorities, the torch was carried out <font color="#6b8e23">by
bus instead of being </font>carried by the athletes. Paris city
officials had announced plans for peaceful demonstrations to welcome
the Olympic torch when it was due to arrive in the French capital.
The city government put up a banner on City Hall reading &quot;Paris
defends human rights throughout the world&quot;, in an effort to
promote &quot;the values of humanity and human rights&quot;. Members
of Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest.
An estimated 3<font color="#a0522d">,000</font> French police
protected the Olympic message as it left the Eiffel Tower and paraded
through Paris amid threats of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet
demonstrations, which included an attempt by more than one protester
to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted
Olympic torch relay officials to extinguish the flame <font color="#228b22">five
</font>times (according to Paris police officials) and load the torch
onto a bus at the insistence of Chinese officials. This was later
denied by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, although video footage
broadcast by the French television network France 2 showed Chinese
flamethrowers extinguishing the torch. Back-up flamethrowers are on
hand throughout to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer
David Douillet expressed his anger at the Chinese flamekeepers who
extinguished the torch he was handing over to <font color="#191970">Teddy
Riner</font>: &quot;I understand that they are afraid of everything,
but this is just annoying. They put out the flame despite the fact
that there was no danger, and they saw it and knew it. I don't know
why they did that.&quot;</p>

Officials directed the torch relay to an unannounced route. The start
took place at McCovey Cove, where US Olympic Committee representative
<font color="#556b2f">Norman Bellingham </font>handed over the torch
to the first torchbearer, 1992 Olympic champion Chinese swimmer <font color="#6b8e23">Lin
Lit. The </font>closing ceremony, scheduled for <font color="#a0522d">Justin
Herman Plaza, </font>was cancelled and instead took place <font color="#228b22">at
San Francisco International Airport</font>, where the torch was
scheduled to depart for Buenos Aires. The rerouting allowed the run
to avoid a large number of pro-China and anti-China protesters. When
people found out that there would be no closing ceremony at Justin
Herman Plaza, the reaction was angry. One protester was quoted as
saying that the route changes were intended to &quot;prevent any
planned organised demonstrations&quot;. San Francisco Board of
Supervisors Chairman Aaron Peskin, who criticised Mayor Gavin Newsom,
said it was a &quot;cynical plan to please the Bush State Department
and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of
money&quot;. Newsom, for his part, said he thought it was &quot;in
everyone's interest&quot; and that he believed people had &quot;the
right to protest and support the torch&quot; despite the route
changes. US Olympic Committee chief <font color="#191970">Peter
Ueberroth </font>praised the route changes and said: &quot;From a
global perspective, the city of San Francisco gets a round of
applause.&quot; People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered,
as seen on live video from CBS and NBC. The cost to the city of
hosting the event was reported to be $726,400, nearly half of which
has been recovered through private fundraising. Mayor Gavin Newsom
said the &quot;exponential&quot; costs associated with the mass
arrests were avoided when he decided to change the route after
consulting with Police Chief Heather Fong.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The torch was lit in a park outside
AT&amp;T Park at around 13:17 PDT (20:17 UTC) and held aloft for a
while by American and Chinese Olympic officials. The relay race was
thrown into disarray when the first runner of the cleverly designed
relay disappeared into a <font color="#a9a9a9">warehouse on </font>the
beach where it remained for half an hour. Thousands of pro-China
demonstrators, many of whom said they had been sent by the Chinese
consulate and other pro-China groups, and both pro-Tibet and
pro-Darfur protesters took up the cause. Non-Chinese demonstrators
were reported to have been overwhelmed and followed by angry mobs. At
around 14:00 PDT (21:00 UTC), the flare was re-ignited about 3
kilometres from the stadium along <font color="#dcdcdc">Van Ness
Avenue</font>, a busy thoroughfare that was not on the official route
plans. According to television reports, the blaze was surrounded by
motorcycles and uniformed police officers. Two torchbearers carried
the flame slowly behind a truck and surrounded by Olympic security
guards. Two of the torchbearers, wheelchair user <font color="#2f4f4f">Andrew
Michael, </font>vice president of sustainability at the Bay Area
Council and director of Partnerships For Change, and environmental
activist Majora Carter, managed to hold up Tibetan flags in protest,
and were removed from the torchbearers. The closing ceremony at
Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled due to the large number of
protesters present. The torch relay ended with a final leg through
the San Francisco <font color="#556b2f">Marina area</font>, after
which it was transferred by bus to <font color="#6b8e23">San
Francisco International Airport, where a </font>temporary closing
ceremony was held in the terminal, from which the free media were
excluded. The San Jose Mercury News described the &quot;treacherous&quot;
event as a &quot;Where's Waldo game played against a beautiful city
landscape&quot;. International Olympic Committee President Jacques
Rogge said the San Francisco Olympics had &quot;fortunately&quot;
avoided much of the disruption that overshadowed the London and Paris
Games, but &quot;it was still not the joyous celebration we would
have hoped for&quot;.</p>

</font>handed over the torch to the first torchbearer, <font color="#a0522d">Carlos

in the Palermo district, with Gabriela Sabatini as the last
torchbearer. The 13.8 kilometre route included landmarks such as the
obelisk and the Plaza de Mayo. The day was marked by several
pro-Tibet demonstrations, including a giant &quot;Free Tibet&quot;
banner and an alternative &quot;human rights torch&quot;, lit by
protesters, which followed the flame-lit route. Most of these
demonstrations were peaceful in nature and the torch was not
obstructed. Chinese migrants also demonstrated in support of the
Games, but only minor skirmishes were reported between the two
groups. Surrounded by security guards, runners carried the Olympic
torch past thousands of cheering Argentines in the smoothest torch
relay in almost a week. People sprayed <font color="#228b22">confetti
</font>on the parade route as banks, government offices and
businesses held an impromptu half-day holiday for the flame's only

 Japan: <font color="#a9a9a9">Nagano,
</font>site of the <font color="#dcdcdc">1998 Winter Olympics</font>,
<font color="#2f4f4f">26 April</font>. The <font color="#556b2f">Japanese
Buddhist temple of Zenkō-ji, </font>originally scheduled to host the
Nagano Olympic torch relay, refused to host the torch relay and
withdrew from the plans because of speculation that monks there would
be sympathetic to anti-Chinese government protesters and the risk of
disruption from violent demonstrations. Parts of the main building of
the Zenkō-ji Temple (Zenkō-ji Hondō), which was rebuilt in 1707
and is one of Japan's national treasures, were vandalised with spray
paint. The city chose a new starting point, formerly the site of <font color="#6b8e23">a
municipal building </font>and now a parking lot. An event planned by
the city at the Minami Nagano Sports Park after the torch relay was
also cancelled because of the potential for disruption by protesters
against China's recent crackdown in Tibet. Thousands of riot police
were deployed to protect the torch along its route. The use of force
kept most protesters in check, but slogans shouted by pro-China or
pro-Tibet demonstrators, Japanese nationalists and human rights
organisations flooded the air. Five men were arrested and four
injured amid the mob violence. The route of the torch was crowded
with mostly peaceful demonstrators. The public was not allowed into
the parking lot where the relay began. The Zenkoji monks then held a
prayer ceremony for the victims of the recent events in Tibet. More
than 100 police ran with torches, and riot police lined the streets
as three helicopters flew overhead. Only <font color="#a0522d">two
</font>Chinese guards were allowed to carry the torch because of
Japanese concerns about how they had treated protesters in previous
relay camps. A man with a Tibetan flag tried to stop the torch relay
at the beginning of its passage, but was dragged away by police. Some
raw eggs were also thrown from the crowd.</p>

held in </font><font color="#a9a9a9">Seoul</font>, host of the <font color="#dcdcdc">1988
Summer Olympics, on </font>27 April. Choi Seung-kook and Park
Won-sun, who were intended to be torchbearers, boycotted the event in
protest at the Chinese government's repression of Tibet. More than
8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route from
<font color="#2f4f4f">the Olympic Park</font>, which was built when
Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the Seoul Torch
Relay, <font color="#556b2f">Chinese students </font>clashed with
protesters by throwing stones, bottles and punches. One North Korean
defector, whose brother defected to China but was captured and
executed by the DPRK, tried to set himself on fire in protest at
China's treatment of North Korean refugees. He poured petrol on
himself but was quickly surrounded by police and taken away. Two
other protesters tried to jump on the torch but failed. Near the
start of the flare-up, a fight broke out between a group of 500
Chinese supporters and about 50 protesters carrying banners that
read: &quot;Free North Korean refugees in China&quot;. Students threw
stones and water bottles as some 2 500 police tried to keep the
groups apart. Police said they had arrested five people, including a
Chinese student who was allegedly arrested for throwing stones.
Thousands of Chinese followed the torch on its 4.5-hour journey, with
some shouting: &quot;Go China, go Olympics!&quot;. At the end of the
relay, the Chinese students turned violent, and Korean media reported
that they were &quot;lynching&quot; anyone who disagreed with them.
One policeman was also taken to hospital after being attacked by the
Chinese students. Justice Minister Kim Kyung Han told the Prime
Minister on 29 April that he would find &quot;every Chinese person
who was involved and bring them to justice&quot;. Later in the day,
the South Korean prosecutor's office, the National Police Agency, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Intelligence Service
issued a joint statement announcing the expulsion of all Chinese
students involved in the incident. China defended the behaviour of
the students.</p>

donating funds to <font color="#2f4f4f">the Dalai Lama.</font> It
also called for the boycott to be extended to French luxury and

French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities such as
Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French state of separatist
conspiracy and <font color="#556b2f">anti-Chinese racism. </font>Some
burned French flags, some added a swastika to <font color="#6b8e23">the

circulated short online messages calling for large demonstrations in
front of French consulates and embassies. Boycotters waving large
Chinese flags blocked some shoppers trying to enter the Carrefour
store in Kunming and hit them with water bottles. Hundreds of people
took part in anti-French demonstrations in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei,
Kunming and Qingdao, and the protests quickly spread to other cities
such as Xi'an, Harbin and Jinan. Carrefour denied support for or
involvement in the Tibet issue and allowed staff in its Chinese
stores to wear uniforms and caps emblazoned with the Chinese national
flag, the Olympic symbols and the words 'Beijing 2008' to show
support for the Games. The action had to be stopped when BOCOG
considered that the use of the official Olympic logos was illegal and
infringed copyright.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The primary objective of primary
schools is to offer all children the right to a curriculum without
selection, which may be based on financial considerations or merit.
This leads to a broader curriculum, including practical subjects such
as <font color="#a9a9a9">design and technology and vocational
learning, which </font>were less common or non-existent in secondary
schools. In smaller primary schools, providing post-16 education in a
cost-effective way is more challenging because the number of courses
needed to cover the broader curriculum is greater with relatively
fewer pupils. As a result, schools have tended to grow and many local
authorities have provided secondary education for 11-16 year olds,
with post-16 education being provided by <font color="#dcdcdc">Sixth
Form Colleges and Further Education Colleges.</font> Primary schools
do not select pupils on the basis of academic achievement or
aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the learning outcomes
profiles of different schools vary considerably. In addition,
government initiatives such as the <font color="#2f4f4f">City
Technology Colleges and Specialist Schools programmes </font>have
made the primary school ideal less certain.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In these schools, children could be
selected on the basis of their aptitude for the school's specific
curriculum, although schools do take quotas from each quartile of
performance to ensure that they are not selective on the basis of
performance. The problem here is whether quotas should be drawn from
the normal distribution or from the achievement distribution of the
immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which is
still in place in many parts of the UK, admission depends on
selection criteria, most often a cognitive test or tests. Although
primary schools were introduced in England and Wales in <font color="#a9a9a9">1965</font>,
selective164 grammar schools are still in operation (albeit in small
numbers compared to the approximately 3,500 state grammar schools in
England). Most comprehensive schools are secondary schools for 11-16
year olds, but a few areas have comprehensive middle schools, and in
some places the secondary level is split into two parts, for 11-14
year olds and 14-18 year olds, roughly equivalent to the US middle
school (or junior high school) and high school. With the introduction
of the key stages in the national curriculum, some local authorities
reverted from the middle school system to schools for 11-16 and 11-18
year olds, so that the transition from one school to another
corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.</p>

system has emerged, consisting of universities (research orientation)
and polytechnics (engineering and applied sciences and vocational
orientation). Vocational colleges offer Bachelor's, Master's and
Doctoral degrees equivalent to universities, validated and managed at
national level by the independent UK Council for National Academic
Awards. In the UK in <font color="#a9a9a9">1992, universities of

however, a university, but only in name, as it can award degrees
under the Act; the Cork Institute of Technology and a few other

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Although
universities of applied sciences </font>and technical colleges are
now generally regarded as similar higher education institutions in
many countries, their status, teaching activities and organisational
history have been quite different in many countries. In many cases,
polytechnics were elite technical universities focusing on applied
science and technology, and may also have been the former name of a
vocational school before it was granted the exclusive right to award
academic degrees and could truly be called a technical university.
Many polytechnics providing higher education are simply the result of
a formal change in their original and historical status as technical
institutions. In some situations, former polytechnics or other
non-university institutions have come into being simply through an
administrative change of statute, often involving a name change and
the introduction of new names such as University of Technology,
Polytechnic, Polytechnic, Polytechnic or University of Technology for
marketing purposes. The emergence of such polytechnics, former
vocational schools and technical schools that have been converted
into more university-like institutions has been a cause for concern,
as the shortage of specialised technical professionals has led to
skills shortages in some sectors and has also led to an increase in
the unemployment rate of graduates. This is mainly the case in
countries where the education system is not controlled by the state
and where everyone can award degrees. Evidence has also shown that
the overall quality of education and the employability of graduates
has deteriorated as technical institutions have been rapidly
transformed into more advanced higher education institutions. Mentz,
Kotze and Van der Merwe (2008) argue that all the tools exist to
promote a debate on the role of technology in higher education in
general and in technical universities in particular. Aspects of this
debate may follow along the following lines: - To what extent is
technology defined as a concept - What is the scope of technology
discourse - What is the place of science and its relationship to
technology - How useful is the Mitcham framework for thinking about
technology in South Africa - Can some form of cooperation rather than
competition be achieved between higher education institutions - Who
is ultimately responsible for vocational education and training and
what is the role of technology in this?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Polytechnics are technical
universities, many of which date back to the mid-19th century. A
handful of world-renowned elite American universities have the terms
&quot;Institute of Technology&quot;, &quot;Polytechnic Institute&quot;,
&quot;Polytechnic University&quot; or similar expressions in their
names; these are usually research-intensive universities focused on
engineering, science and technology. The earliest and best known of
these institutions are Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI, <font color="#a9a9a9">1824</font>),
New York University's Tandon School of Engineering (1854) and
<font color="#dcdcdc">Massachusetts Institute of Technology </font>(MIT,
1861). These institutions, known as technical colleges or technical
institutes, generally provide post-secondary education in technical
and mechanical fields and focus on vocational skills training
primarily at the community college level - in parallel and sometimes
in a similar way to the first two years of a bachelor's degree.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Venezuelan Institutes of Technology
were developed <font color="#a9a9a9">in the 1950s</font>, in the
French concept of polytechnics, as an alternative to post-technical
and post-scientific education. At the time, technical education was
considered essential for the development of a healthy <font color="#dcdcdc">middle-class

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 76</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Most of these institutions award
diplomas after three or three and a half years of training. The
Institute for the Implementation of Technology (IUT in Spanish:
Instituto universitario de tecnologia) began with the establishment
of the first IUT in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, called IUT. <font color="#dcdcdc">Dr
Federico Rivero Palacio introduced the </font>French &quot;Institut
Universitaire de Technologie&quot; system, which used French staff
and a system of study based on three-year periods, with research and
engineering facilities at the same level as in the main national
universities, and where French equivalent degrees could be obtained.
This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela to have recognised
degrees equivalent to French degrees, and the implementation of this
system and the discovery of high quality degrees led to the
establishment of a number of other IUTs in Venezuela, but despite
this, the term IUT was not used appropriately, leading to some
institutions being of mediocre quality and not having an equivalent
degree in France. Later, some private institutions emerged which used
the IUT as their name, but they were not regulated under the original
French system and awarded lower quality qualifications.</p>

pre-trial motion to exclude the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay
and unverified source, but <font color="#2f4f4f">Judge Arlander Keys

that the employee's affidavit contained both hearsay and vague

gene sizes may have more detectable differences between them, leading
to changes in their evolutionary rates. Because the <font color="#556b2f">endosymbiotic

a </font>relationship in which one species is inhibited or completely
eliminated and not affected by another species. This type of
symbiosis is relatively rare in primitive reference texts, but it is
ubiquitous in nature.There are two types of <font color="#dcdcdc">amensalism,
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">competition </font><font color="#556b2f">and
antibiosis. </font>In competition, a larger or stronger organism
deprives a smaller or weaker one of a resource. <font color="#a0522d">Antibiosis
</font>occurs when one organism damages or kills another organism
through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a seedling
growing in the shade of a mature tree. The mature tree can begin to
deprive the seedling of needed sunlight, and if the mature tree is
very large, it can absorb rainwater and deplete the soil of
nutrients. Throughout the process, the mature tree is unaffected. If
the seedling dies, the mature tree gets nutrients from the decaying
seedling. It should be noted that these nutrients are made available
by the decay of the seedling and not from the living seedling, which
would be parasitic. An example of an antibiotic is Juglans nigra
(<font color="#228b22">black walnut), which </font>secretes <font color="#191970">juglone</font>,

lie in the colonial militia groups that served alongside the French

the early 20th century. Thereafter, a distinctly Canadian army and
navy and air force were established, which, due to the constitutional

Operations Regiment. More funds were also allocated to recruitment,
which had declined in the 1980s and 1990s, possibly because the
Canadian population had come to regard the CAF as peacekeepers rather
than soldiers, as shown by a 2008 study commissioned by the
Department of National Defence. The survey found that nearly
two-thirds of Canadians agreed that the country should be involved in
the invasion of Afghanistan and that the military should be stronger,
but also that the purpose of the force should be different, for
example more focused on responding to natural disasters. Later that
year, CDS Walter Natynczyk said that while recruitment had been more
successful, the problem for the military was the <font color="#6b8e23">loss

Sikh religion may wear uniform turbans (dastar) (or patka, when in
use), and Muslim women may wear a uniform hijab under their permitted
headgear. Jews may wear a yarmulke under a permitted headdress and
bareheaded. The <font color="#6b8e23">beret </font>is probably the
most commonly worn headgear and is worn by almost all uniforms
(except the more formal uniforms of the navy and air force) and its
colour is determined by the wearer's environment, branch of service

prefer to wear either a service uniform or the authorised ball cap
(operational dress for ships), which is only worn by the navy. Air
Force personnel, especially officers, prefer the wedge hat to all
other headgear. There is no variation of the wedge cap in the Navy.
The Yukon cap and jacket are worn only with the winter suit, although
scavengers and combat divers may wear the jacket year-round as a wax
cap. Soldiers in the Highland, Scottish and Irish regiments generally
wear alternative headgear such as glengarry, balmoral, tam o'shanter

or &quot;hinge&quot;), was first used in late antiquity to refer to a
bishop or priest who was associated with a church to which he was not
originally ordained. In Rome, the first persons to be called
cardinals were <font color="#a9a9a9">the deacons of the seven
districts of the city at </font>the beginning of the 6th century,
when the word <font color="#dcdcdc">began to mean 'chief', 'eminent'
or 'superior'.</font> The title was also given to the high priest of
each of Rome's 'nominal' (parish) churches and to the bishops of the
seven cathedrals surrounding the city. In the <font color="#2f4f4f">eighth
century, </font>Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among
the Roman clergy<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font> They participated in
the administration of the Roman Church and in the papal liturgy. By
decision of the Synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become
Pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of <font color="#6b8e23">Nicholas
II, the </font>cardinals were given the right to elect a pope <font color="#a0522d">by
the papal bull In nomine Domini. For </font>a time this power was
given exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but at the <font color="#228b22">Third
Lateran Council in </font>1179 the right was restored to the entire
College of Cardinals. <font color="#191970">Pope Innocent IV </font>granted
the right to wear the red hat to cardinals in <font color="#8b0000">1244.</font></p>

and in <font color="#556b2f">1962</font>, Pope John XXIII made it the
norm that all cardinals be ordained bishops, even if they were only
priests at the time of their appointment. As a result of these two
changes, Canon <font color="#6b8e23">351 </font>of the 1983 Code of
Canon Law requires that a cardinal must be at least a priest at the

be ordained bishops. Several cardinals who are over or close to 80
years of age at the time of appointment have been exempted from the
rule that they must be bishops. They were all appointed cardinal
deacons, but one of them, Roberto Tucci, lived long enough to
exercise his option and was promoted to cardinal bishop.</p>

divided into <font color="#6b8e23">two dialects, </font>conventionally

terms, which date back to the 19th century, are somewhat misleading,
as 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but
also comes from a different geographical area. The Old Avestan
dialect is very archaic and at about the same stage of development as
<font color="#a0522d">Rigvedic Sanskrit. </font>On the other hand,
the younger Avestan language is at roughly the same linguistic stage

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the Islamic conquest of Persia
(Iran), the status of the different dialects in the Persian Empire
changed significantly. The old authoritative form of Middle Iranian,
also known as Pahlavi, was replaced by a new standard dialect called
<font color="#dcdcdc">Dari, which was the </font>official language of
the court. The name <font color="#2f4f4f">Dari </font>comes from the
word darbâr (<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">دربار</span></font>),
which refers to the royal court where many poets, protagonists and
patrons of literature flourished. <font color="#a0522d">The Saffarid
dynasty in </font>particular was the first of many dynasties to
officially adopt the new language in <font color="#228b22">875 AD.</font>
Dari may have been heavily influenced by the regional dialects of
eastern Iran, while the earlier Pahlavi standard was based more on
western dialects. This new authoritative dialect became the basis of
the new standard Persian dialect. Medieval Iranian scholars such as
Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa (8th century) and Ibn al-Nadim (10th century)
associated the term &quot;Dari&quot; with the eastern province of
<font color="#191970">Khorasan</font>, while they used the term
&quot;Pahlavi&quot; to describe the dialects of the north-western
regions between Isfahan and Azerbaijan and &quot;Pârsi&quot;
(&quot;Persian proper&quot;) to describe the dialects of Fars. They
also noted that the informal language of the kings themselves was yet
another dialect, <font color="#8b0000">&quot;khuzi&quot;, which was

Prehistoric humans used primitive oil lamps to light the environment.
These lamps were made from naturally occurring materials such as
stones, shells, horns and stones, filled with fat and fitted with a
fibrous wick. The lamps were typically fuelled by animal or vegetable
fats. Hundreds of such lamps (hollow worked stones) have been found
in the caves of Lascaux in present-day France dating back some <font color="#2f4f4f">15

light sources may also be expressed as the percentage of light
transmitted from the 'bulb' to the environment. The more transparent

luminaire that converts <font color="#dcdcdc">electrical energy </font>into

sized and marketed primarily on the basis of their power consumption,
expressed in watts, lighting technology beyond the incandescent lamp
has broken the link between watts and the amount of light produced.
For example, a 60 watt incandescent lamp produces about the same
amount of light as a 13 watt compact fluorescent lamp. Each of these
technologies has a different efficiency in converting electrical
energy into visible light. Visible light output is usually measured
in lumens. This unit measures only visible radiation and does not
include invisible infrared and ultraviolet light. A wax candle
produces about 13 lumens, a <font color="#2f4f4f">60 watt

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Light measurement, or photometry, is
usually concerned with the amount of useful light reaching a surface
and the amount of light coming from a lamp or other source, and the
colours that can be reproduced by this light. The human eye reacts
differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum, so
photometric measurements must take into account the luminous
intensity function when measuring the amount of useful light. The
basic unit of measurement in the SI system is the <font color="#a9a9a9">candela
(cd)</font>, which describes luminous intensity, and all other
photometric units are derived from the candela. For example,
luminance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a
given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through
or emanates from a given area and falls within a given solid angle.
The SI unit for luminance is the candela per square metre (<font color="#dcdcdc">cd/m2)</font>.
The CGS unit for luminance is <font color="#2f4f4f">stilb, which is
equal to </font>one candela per square centimetre, or 10 kcd/m2 . The

23 surgical patients were examined and placed in rooms overlooking a

placed in rooms with windows that had a lot of natural light had
shorter post-operative hospital stays, received fewer negative
evaluative comments in nurses' notes and took fewer strong analgesics
than 23 similar patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick
wall. This study suggests that due to the nature of the landscape and
exposure to daylight, patients were indeed healthier than those
exposed to a low-light brick wall. In addition to increased work
performance, the proper use of windows and daylighting goes beyond
mere aesthetics and overall health.</p>

dim light makes people make more rational decisions and negotiate

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1849, Canadian geologist <font color="#dcdcdc">Abraham
Gesner </font>developed a method to distil kerosene from oil in 2001.
Earlier <font color="#2f4f4f">coal gas methods </font>had been used
for lighting since the 1820s, but they were expensive. Gesner's
kerosene was cheap, easy to produce, could be burned in existing
lamps and did not give off an unpleasant odour like most whale oils.
It could be stored indefinitely, unlike whale oil, which eventually
spoiled. The US oil boom began in the 1850s. By the end of the
decade, 30 kerosene refineries were operating in the United States.
Cheaper and more efficient fuel began to displace whale oil from the
market. John D. Rockefeller was largely responsible for the
commercial success of kerosene. He established the network of
kerosene distilleries that later became Standard Oil, thus
eliminating the need for whale oil lamps altogether. These types of
lamps can catch fire or emit carbon monoxide, and sometimes have an
odour that makes them problematic for asthmatics.</p>

lamps </font>(CFLs) use less power to produce the same amount of
light as incandescent lamps, but they contain mercury, which is
dangerous to dispose of. Because CFLs can help reduce electricity
consumption, many organisations have taken steps to promote the use
of CFLs. Some utilities and local governments have subsidised CFLs or
provided them free of charge to customers as a way of reducing
electricity demand. For a given light output, CFLs consume between
one-fifth and one-quarter of the power of an incandescent lamp. One
of the simplest and quickest ways for households or businesses to
increase their energy efficiency is to adopt CFLs as their main light
source, suggests the Alliance for Climate Protection. Unlike
incandescent light bulbs, CFLs need some time to 'warm up' and reach

as a result of the patronage system and replace them with more
&quot;deserving&quot; individuals. However, the Senate refused to
confirm many of the new appointments and instead demanded that
Cleveland hand over confidential documents relating to his
suspension. Cleveland flatly refused, arguing: &quot;These
suspensions are within my executive power ...&quot;. I am not
responsible to the Senate, nor am I willing to subject my actions to
Senate censure.&quot; Cleveland's popular support forced the Senate
to back down and confirm the nominees. In addition, Congress finally
repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act passed during the

architecture became multidisciplinary, specialising in each type of

addition, the &quot;design&quot; architect [Note 1] has become
increasingly distinct from the &quot;project architect&quot; who
ensures that the project meets required standards and addresses
liability issues [Note 2].The processes for preparing the design of
any large building have become increasingly complex, requiring
preliminary studies on issues such as sustainability, durability,
quality, value for money and compliance with local laws. A large
building can no longer be designed by <font color="#556b2f">one

architectural profession have criticised <font color="#6b8e23">modernism

sustainability </font>has become a mainstream issue with profound
implications for the architectural profession. Many developers who
support the financing of buildings have learned to promote
environmentally sustainable design rather than solutions based
primarily on direct costs. Notable examples include passive solar
design of buildings, more environmentally friendly roof structures,
biodegradable materials and greater attention to the energy use of
the building. This major shift in architecture has also changed

green building. Sustainable practices, which were at the heart of
vernacular architecture, are increasingly providing inspiration for
modern technologies that are environmentally and socially
