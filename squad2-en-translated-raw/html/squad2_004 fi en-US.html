<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Classical music is art music
produced by or rooted in the <font color="#a9a9a9">Western </font><font color="#dcdcdc">musical
</font>traditions, including both liturgical (religious) and secular
music. Although a similar term is also used to refer to the period
1750-1820 (the <font color="#2f4f4f">Classical period)</font>, this
article deals with a broad period from roughly the 11th century to
the present day, which includes the Classical period and several
other periods. The key norms of this tradition were codified <font color="#556b2f">between
1550 and 1900, </font>known as the common practice period. The major
periods of classical music are as follows: the early music period,
which includes the medieval (500-1400) and Renaissance (<font color="#6b8e23">1400-1600</font>)
periods; the common practice period, which includes the Baroque
(<font color="#a0522d">1600-1750</font>), Classical (1750-1820) and
<font color="#228b22">Romantic </font>(1804-1910) periods; and the
1900s (1901-2000), which includes the modern (<font color="#191970">1890-1930),
which </font>overlaps with the late 19th century, the high modern
(mid-20th century) and the modern or postmodern (1975-2015) periods.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">What distinguishes European art
music from many other forms of non-European and popular music is, to
a large extent, <font color="#a9a9a9">its system of musical notation,
which has been </font>in use <font color="#dcdcdc">since around the
16th century</font>. Composers use <font color="#2f4f4f">Western
notation </font>to define for the performer the pitches (e.g.
melodies, bass lines and/or chords), tempo, time signature and rhythm
of a piece of music. This leaves less room for <font color="#556b2f">improvisation
</font>and ad libitum ornamentation, often heard in non-European art
music and popular music styles such as <font color="#6b8e23">jazz and
blues. </font>Another difference is that while most popular music
styles are suited to the vocal form, classical music has developed
highly sophisticated instrumental forms such as the concerto,
symphony and sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental forms such as
opera, which are very <font color="#a0522d">complex because they are

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Given the wide variety of genres of
classical music, ranging from medieval plainchant sung by <font color="#a9a9a9">monks
to the </font>classical and romantic orchestral symphonies of the
1700s and 1800s to the avant-garde atonal compositions <font color="#dcdcdc">for
solo piano of the </font>20th century, it is difficult to list the
characteristics that can be attributed to all these types of works.
<font color="#2f4f4f">However, classical music has </font>features
that few if any other musical genres have, such as <font color="#556b2f">the
use of printed scores and the performance of very complex
instrumental works </font>(e.g. the fugue). Although <font color="#6b8e23">the
symphony did </font>not exist <font color="#a0522d">throughout

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 4</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A key feature of classical music,
which distinguishes it from popular and folk music, is that the
repertoire is usually written down in musical notation, resulting in
a musical part or score. The score usually specifies the details of
<font color="#a9a9a9">rhythm </font>and pitch and, if two or more
musicians (singers or instrumentalists) are involved, the
coordination of the different parts. The literary quality of the
score has enabled it to contain a high level of complexity: for
example, <font color="#dcdcdc">J.S. Bach's </font>fugues combine in a
striking way boldly distinctive melodic lines that intertwine
contrapuntally, yet create a coherent harmonic logic that would be
impossible in the heat of <font color="#2f4f4f">live improvisation</font>.
The use of <font color="#556b2f">written notation </font>also
preserves the recording of the works and allows classical musicians
to perform music from centuries ago. Notation allows 21st century
performers to sing a 13th century Renaissance choral piece or a 17th
century Baroque concerto in a way that reproduces many of the musical
features (melodies, words, forms and rhythms).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Question 0</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The fugues of J.S. Bach create a
coherent harmonic logic that would be impossible in any other style
of music?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Question 1</b></p>

different parts are coordinated, the pitch and what other details?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 5</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Nevertheless, the score does not
give complete and precise instructions <font color="#a9a9a9">for the
performance of a historical work</font>. Although the tempo is
written in Italian (e.g. Allegro), we do not know exactly how fast
the piece should be played. Similarly, <font color="#dcdcdc">in the
Baroque period, </font>many works designed for basso continuo
accompaniment do not specify which instruments play the accompaniment
or how a keyboard instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play
chords that are not indicated in the accompaniment part (only the
figured bass symbol below the bass part is used to guide the
performer playing the accompaniment). The performer and/or conductor
has a number of possibilities for musical expression and
interpretation in the score, including the phrasing of the melody,
the duration of fermatas (<font color="#2f4f4f">sustained notes</font>)
or rests, and the use (or non-use) of effects such as vibrato or
glissando (these effects are possible with a variety of string,
brass, woodwind and <font color="#556b2f">human voices</font>).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Question 0</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although classical music in the 21st
century has lost most of its tradition of musical <font color="#a9a9a9">improvisation,
</font>from baroque to romanticism, there are examples of performers
who were able to improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque
era, <font color="#dcdcdc">organists </font>improvised preludes,
harpsichordists improvised chords from figured bass symbols below the
bass continuo section, and both vocal and <font color="#2f4f4f">instrumentalists
</font>improvised musical embellishments. <font color="#556b2f">J.S.
Bach </font>was particularly known for his complex improvisations<font color="#556b2f">.
</font>In the classical music era, the composer-performer Mozart was
renowned <font color="#6b8e23">for his ability to improvise melodies
in different styles</font>. During the Classical era, some virtuoso
soloists improvised the cadenza parts of a concerto. In the Romantic
era, Beethoven improvised on the piano. For more information, see

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The instruments used in most
classical music today were largely invented before <font color="#a9a9a9">the
mid-19th century </font>(often much earlier) and were codified in the
1700s and 1800s. They consist of orchestral or concert band
instruments plus a number of other solo instruments (such as the
piano, harpsichord and organ). The <font color="#dcdcdc">symphony
orchestra </font>is the most widely known instrument in classical
music and includes members of the string, woodwind, <font color="#2f4f4f">wind</font>,
<font color="#2f4f4f">brass </font>and percussion families. The
concert orchestra is made up of members of the woodwind, brass and
percussion families. It usually has a greater variety of woodwind and
brass instruments than an orchestra, but does not have <font color="#556b2f">a
string section.</font> However, many concert orchestras use the
double bass. Vocal practices changed a great deal during the
Classical period, from the monophonic monophonic Gregorian chant of
the medieval monks to the complex polyphonic choral works of the
Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used several independent
vocal melodies at the same time.</p>

perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms. Medieval
instruments included woodwinds (which in the 21st century are made of
metal), wind instruments and lute-like stringed instruments. There
were also early versions of the organ, violin (or <font color="#dcdcdc">fiddle)
</font>and trombone (called the <font color="#2f4f4f">bagpipe).
</font>Medieval instruments in Europe were most commonly used <font color="#556b2f">alone</font>,
often accompanied by an instrument alone, or sometimes in parts. From
at least the 13th century until the 15th century, instruments were

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The 'standard' configuration of
double brass and brass in orchestras from the first half of the 19th
century is usually attributed to <font color="#a9a9a9">Beethoven</font>.
The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto and
Piano Concerto No. 4, each of which features a single flute. The
composer's instrumentation usually included double flutes, oboes,
clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets. Beethoven carefully planned
the expansion of this particular <font color="#dcdcdc">sonic palette
</font>in symphonies 3, 5, 6 and 9 to innovative effect. In the
Eroica Symphony, the third French horn enters the symphony to give
harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of a 'chorale' brass in the
trio. Piccolo, contrabassoon and trombones add to the exhilarating
finale of his <font color="#2f4f4f">Symphony No. 5</font>. The
piccolo and trombone pair help produce the 'storm' and '<font color="#556b2f">sunshine'
of </font>the sixth. The Ninth Symphony calls for a second pair of
horns for similar reasons to the Eroica (four horns have since become
standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo and contrabassoon, trombones
and untuned percussion - as well as chorus and vocal soloists - is
his earliest suggestion that the symphony's tonal boundaries should
be extended. For <font color="#6b8e23">several decades </font>after
Beethoven's death, symphonic instrumentation followed Beethoven's

piano, with its stronger, more sustained sound and wider range, took
the <font color="#a9a9a9">place of </font>the more subtle-sounding
<font color="#a9a9a9">fortepiano</font>. The orchestra retained the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The primacy of the score written by
the composer has also led to a relatively limited role for
improvisation in classical music today, in sharp contrast to the
practices of musicians of the Baroque, Classical and Romantic eras.
Improvisation in the performance of classical music was common in
both <font color="#a9a9a9">the Baroque and early Romantic periods,
</font>but declined sharply <font color="#dcdcdc">in the second half
of the 19th century and in the 20th century</font>. During the
Classical period, Mozart and Beethoven often improvised <font color="#2f4f4f">the
cadenzas of their piano concertos </font>(and thus encouraged others
to do so), but they also provided written cadenzas for other
soloists. In opera, the practice of singing strictly according to the
score, or <font color="#556b2f">come scritto</font>, was famously
popularised by <font color="#6b8e23">soprano Maria Callas, </font>who
called it the 'straitjacket practice', suggesting that it helped to

city, and the ports have long been the city's main source of
employment. It is particularly a port for <font color="#a9a9a9">cruise

<font color="#dcdcdc">half of the UK's </font>passenger traffic.
Today, it remains home to luxury cruise ships, the largest freight
port on the Channel coast and the fourth largest port in the UK in
terms of <font color="#2f4f4f">tonnage, </font>with several container
terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London and
Bristol, where industry and ports have largely moved out of the city
centres, leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton has retained
much of its in-town industry. While there are still active and
expanding port areas to the west of the city centre, which have been
further developed with the opening of the fourth cruise terminal in
<font color="#556b2f">2009</font>, some of the eastern port areas
have been redeveloped; a good example is Ocean Village, which

recorded, thus reducing the apparent crime figures. The national
average for violence against the person is 16.7 incidents per 1,000
population, while the Southampton average is 42.4 incidents per 1,000
population. In the vehicle theft category, the national average is
7.6 per 1,000 population, compared to 28.4 per 1,000 population in
Southampton. Overall, the city records 202 crimes per 1000

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Tito was the chief architect of the
second Yugoslavia, a socialist federation that lasted from
<font color="#a9a9a9">19431991-1992</font>. Although he was one of
the founders of the Kominform, he soon became the first member of the
Kominform to challenge Soviet hegemony and the only one who managed
to leave <font color="#dcdcdc">the Kominform </font>and start his own
socialist programme. Tito advocated independent paths to socialism
(sometimes called &quot;national communism&quot;). In <font color="#2f4f4f">1951,
</font>he introduced a system of self-government that separated
Yugoslavia from the other socialist countries. The shift towards a
model of market socialism brought economic growth in the 1950s and
1960s and recession in the 1970s. His domestic policies included
suppressing nationalist sentiment and promoting 'brotherhood and
unity' among the six Yugoslav nations. After Tito's death in 1980,
tensions between the Yugoslav republics arose and in <font color="#556b2f">1991
the country </font>fell apart, plunging into a series of wars and
unrest that lasted throughout the rest of the decade and continues to
affect most of the former Yugoslav republics. He remains a highly
controversial figure in the Balkans.</p>

in Kumrovec </font>in the northern part of Croatia, in the Hrvatsko
Zagorje region of Austria-Hungary.He was the seventh child of Franjo
and Marija Broz. His father Franjo Broz (26 November 1860 - 16

mother Marija (25 March 1864 - 14 January 1918) was <font color="#556b2f">Slovenian</font>.
His parents married on 21 January 1891. After spending part of his
childhood with his maternal grandfather Martin Javeršek in the
Slovenian village of Podsreda, he entered the Kumrovec primary school
in 1900, where he failed the <font color="#6b8e23">2nd </font>grade
and graduated in 1905. In 1907 he moved away from the countryside and
started work as a machinist's apprentice in Sisak. There he became
acquainted with the labour movement and celebrated the first Labour
Day - Labour Day - on 1 May. In 1910, he joined the Union of
Metalworkers and at the same time the Social Democratic Party of
Croatia and Slavonia. Between 1911 and 1913 Broz worked for short
periods in Kamnik (1911-1912, factory 'Titan'), Cenkov, Munich and
Mannheim, where he worked at the Benz car factory; then he went to
Wiener Neustadt in Austria and worked as a test driver for Daimler.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In January 1920, Tito and his wife
made the long and difficult journey home to Yugoslavia, where he
arrived in September. On his return, Broz joined the Yugoslav
Communist Party. The CPY's influence in the political life of the
Kingdom of Yugoslavia grew rapidly. In the 1920 elections, the
Communists won seats59 in parliament and became the third strongest
party. They won numerous local elections and gained support in the
second largest city of Zagreb by electing <font color="#dcdcdc">Svetozar
Delić </font>as mayor. The young communist assassinated Yugoslav
Interior Minister Milorad Drašković on 2 August 1921, after which
the CPY was declared illegal under Yugoslavia's 1921 State Security
Law. In 1920 and 1921, all mandates won by the Communists were
annulled. Broz continued to work underground despite government
pressure on the communists. At the beginning of 1921, he moved to
<font color="#2f4f4f">Veliko Trojstvo, </font>near Bjelovar, and
found work as a machinist. In 1925 Broz moved to Kraljevica, where he
started working in a shipyard. He was elected trade union leader and
a year later he led a strike at the shipyard. He was fired and moved
to Belgrade, where he worked at the train carriage factory in
Smederevska Palanka. He was elected workers' commissioner, but was
immediately dismissed when his CPY membership was revealed. Broz then
moved to Zagreb, where he was appointed secretary of the Croatian
Metalworkers' Union. In 1928 he became secretary of the Zagreb branch
of the CPY. In the same year he was arrested, charged in court with
illegal communist activities and imprisoned. During <font color="#556b2f">his
five </font>years in Lepoglava prison, he met <font color="#6b8e23">Moša
Pijade, who </font>became his ideological mentor. After his release,

representatives of the royal government-in-exile, including Ivan

form of government. In November 1945, the Republican Popular Front,
led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Tito, won the elections
by an overwhelming majority, as the monarchists boycotted the vote.
<font color="#556b2f">Tito </font>apparently enjoyed huge popular
support at the time, as he was widely seen as the liberator of
Yugoslavia. In the immediate post-war period, the Yugoslav regime
succeeded in uniting a country severely affected by extremist
nationalist unrest and the destruction caused by the war, while at
the same time succeeding in suppressing nationalist sentiments among
the various peoples in favour of tolerance and the common goal of
Yugoslavia. After an overwhelming electoral victory, Tito was
confirmed as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. The country was soon renamed the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FPRY) (later definitively the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)). The Constituent Assembly of
Yugoslavia formally deposed <font color="#6b8e23">King Peter II </font>on

states of Eastern Central Europe, Yugoslavia was liberated from Axis
rule with little direct support from the Red Army. Tito's leading
role in the liberation of Yugoslavia greatly strengthened his
position within his party and among the Yugoslav people, but it also
led him to emphasise that Yugoslavia had more room to pursue its own
interests than the other leaders of the bloc, who had more reason
(and pressure) to recognise the efforts of the Soviet Union to help
them liberate their own countries from Axis control. Although Tito

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Immediately after the Second World
War, several armed incidents took place between Yugoslavia and the
Western Allies. After the war, Yugoslavia took control of the Italian
region of <font color="#a9a9a9">Istria and the </font>cities of Zadar
and Rijeka. The Yugoslav leadership also sought to incorporate
<font color="#dcdcdc">Trieste </font>into the country, which the
Western Allies opposed. This led to several armed incidents, notably
attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on US transport aircraft, which
provoked bitter criticism in the West. Between 1945 and 1948, at
least <font color="#2f4f4f">four </font>US aircraft were shot
down.[better source] Stalin opposed these provocations, believing
that the Soviet Union was not ready to face the West in open warfare
so soon after the defeats of World War II and at a time when the
United States had operational nuclear weapons, while the Soviet Union
had not yet conducted its first test. Moreover, <font color="#556b2f">Tito

while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill that he
would not pursue Soviet interests there, although he did politically
support the Greek Communist struggle, as he demonstrated at several
UN Security Council meetings. In 1948, motivated by the desire to
create a strong independent economy, Tito formulated his economic
development plan independently of Moscow, leading to a diplomatic

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Soviet reply of 4 May reproached
Tito and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPJ) for not admitting
and correcting their mistakes, and accused them of being too proud of
their success against the Germans, claiming that the Red Army had
saved them from destruction. Tito's reply of 17 May suggested that
the matter should be resolved at the June meeting of the Kominform.
However, Tito did not attend the second <font color="#a9a9a9">Cominform
</font>meeting for fear of an open attack on Yugoslavia. <font color="#dcdcdc">1949The
crisis </font>was close to escalating into an armed conflict as
Hungarian and Soviet troops had massed on Yugoslavia's northern
border. On 28 June, the other member states expelled Yugoslavia,
citing 'nationalist elements' who had 'succeeded in gaining a
dominant position in the leadership of the CPY over the last five or
six months'. In Moscow, it was assumed that once it was known that
Tito had lost the approval of the Soviet Union, he would collapse. &quot;I
wag my little finger and Tito is no more,&quot; Stalin said. The
expulsion effectively expelled Yugoslavia from the International
League of Socialist States, and other socialist states in Eastern
Europe subsequently carried out purges of alleged '<font color="#2f4f4f">Tito</font>'<font color="#2f4f4f">s'.

Stalin used against his own in the Soviet Union. Not all those

death, speculation began as to whether his successors could continue
to hold Yugoslavia together. Ethnic divisions and conflicts grew and
eventually erupted in a series of wars in Yugoslavia a decade after
his death.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During Tito's lifetime, and
especially in the first year after his death, several places were
named after him. Several of these places have since reverted to their
original names, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">Podgorica</font>,
formerly Titograd (although Podgorica International Airport is still
known as TGD), and Užice, formerly Titovo Užice, which reverted to
its original name in <font color="#dcdcdc">1992.</font> The streets
of the capital Belgrade have also all reverted to their original
pre-World War II and pre-communist names. In 2004, the Broz statue of
Antun Augustinčić in his hometown of <font color="#2f4f4f">Kumrovec
</font>was cut down in an explosion. It was later repaired. In 2008,
two demonstrations were held in Zagreb's Marsalkka Tito Square,
organised by a group called Circle for the Square (Krug za Trg) to
force the city government to rename the square to its previous name,
while a counter-demonstration organised by the Citizens' Initiative
against Ustasism (Građanska inicijativa protiv ustaštva) accused
Circle for the Square of historical revisionism and neo-fascism.
<font color="#556b2f">Croatian </font>President Stjepan Mesić
criticised the demonstration for changing the name. The main (and
longest) street in the Croatian coastal town of Opatija still bears
the name of Marshal Tito, as do streets in numerous Serbian towns,
mainly in the north of the country. One of the main streets in
central Sarajevo is called Marshal Tito Street, and the statue of
Tito in the park in front of the university campus in Marijin Dvor
(former JNA barracks &quot;Maršal Tito&quot;) is a place where
Bosnians and Sarajevans still remember and honour Tito today (photo

located in Tito Square (Titov trg in Slovenian), the central square
of Velenje<font color="#6b8e23"> in Slovenia.</font> One of the most
important bridges in Maribor, Slovenia's second largest city, is the
Tito Bridge (Titov most). The central square of Koper, Slovenia's
largest port city, is also called Tito Square.</p>

when they finally married in April 1952, with <font color="#556b2f">Aleksandar
Ranković, the </font>head of state security, as best man. The
marriage was somewhat unexpected, as Tito had in fact rejected her
some years earlier when his confidant Ivan Krajacic initially brought
him together. She was in her twenties at the time, and Tito, not
liking her energetic personality, chose the more mature opera singer
Zinka Kunc to replace her. Not easily discouraged, Jovanka continued
to work at the Beli Dvor, where she managed the staff and eventually
got another chance after Tito and Zinka's strange relationship
failed. As the only female partner he married while in power, <font color="#6b8e23">Jovanka
</font>also went down in history as Yugoslavia's first woman.
However, their relationship was not a happy one. It had experienced
many, often public, ups and downs, with infidelity and even
allegations that the latter couple were preparing a coup. According
to some unofficial reports, Tito and Jovanka even officially divorced
in the late 1970s, shortly before Tito's death. However, Jovanka was
officially present at Tito's funeral as Tito's wife and later claimed
inheritance rights. The couple had no children.</p>

escalated its attacks in Yemen. The Pentagon said that the destroyer
USS Farragut and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched
after receiving a distress call from the Tigris, and it was also

origin:482 and <font color="#dcdcdc">was of different origin from the
Slavic peasants </font>(kmiecie; Lat. cmethones):430 :118 which they
ruled:482. The Szlachta were distinct from the rural population. The
nobles' sense of distinction led to practices that in later times
would be characterized as racism:233 Szlachta were nobles in the
Aryan sense - &quot;noble&quot; as opposed to the people over whom
they ruled after coming into contact with them:482 Szlachta traced
their ancestry to Lech/Lekh, who probably founded the Polish Empire
<font color="#2f4f4f">around the fifth century. </font>:482 Lechia
was the name of ancient Poland, and the Szlachta's own name for
themselves was Lechici/Lekhi.:482 The exact counterpart of the
Szlachta society was the Meerassee system of property in South India
- an egalitarian aristocracy that settled as conquerors among a
distinct race.:484 The Polish state was similar to the Roman Empire
in that full civil rights were limited to the Szlachti. The <font color="#556b2f">szlachta

granted land by the Prince, which gave them the financial means to
serve the Prince militarily. Before the 1400s, Polish nobles were
known as '<font color="#a9a9a9">rycerz'</font>, a term very similar
to the English '<font color="#dcdcdc">knight', but with the </font>crucial
difference that the status of 'rycerz' was almost strictly
hereditary; the class of all such persons was known as 'rycerstwo'.
This second class of rycerstwo, which represented <font color="#2f4f4f">the
wealthiest Polish families and itinerant knights seeking fortunes
abroad, </font><font color="#556b2f">gradually became a separate
</font>class of rycerstwo <font color="#556b2f">from the elite groups
of Mieszko I and his successors</font>, which became
szlachta/nobility ('szlachta' is the actual term for the Polish
nobility from around the 15th century onwards). This
rycerstwo/nobility were given additional privileges, which gave them
a privileged status. They were exempted from special burdens and
duties under a duke's law, as a result of which only rycerstwo
(military prowess and high/ noble birth) <font color="#6b8e23">could
serve as civil servants in the state administration.</font></p>

paradox: the Polish nobility claimed to be from the Sarmatian tribes,
but the Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus a new
Roman-Sarmatian theory was born. Strong cultural ties with the Polish
nobility led to the emergence in the 16th century of a new term for
the Lithuanian nobility, šlėkta, which was a direct borrowing from
the Polish word szlachta. In terms of historical truth, the

abolished <font color="#2f4f4f">in Russian Poland on 19 February
1864</font>. It was deliberately enacted in a way that would destroy
the szlachta. It was the only region where peasants paid the market
price for their land in exchange (the national average was 34% above
the market price). All land taken from Polish peasants after 1846 had
to be returned without redemption payments. Former serfs were <font color="#556b2f">only

not to the szlachta</font>. 90 % of the former serfs of the empire
who actually received land after 1861 were in the eight western
provinces. Apart from Romania, Polish landless or domestic serfs were
the only ones who received land after the abolition of serfdom. All
this was to punish the Szlachta forces for their part in the
uprisings of 1830 and 1863. By 1864, 80% of the szlachta were
déclassé, 1/4 of the petty nobility were worse off than the average

born in the <font color="#a9a9a9">Andes </font>village of Mantua,
near Cisalpine Gaul. Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he
was descended from earlier Roman colonists. Modern speculation is
ultimately unsupported by narrative evidence from his own writings or
his later biographers. Macrobius says that Virgil's father was of
<font color="#dcdcdc">humble </font>origins; however, scholars
generally believe that Virgil came from <font color="#2f4f4f">a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to commentators, Virgil
received his first education at the age of five, and later went to
Cremona, <font color="#a9a9a9">Milan </font>and finally Rome to study
<font color="#dcdcdc">rhetoric, </font><font color="#2f4f4f">medicine
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">and astronomy, which </font>he soon
abandoned in favour of philosophy. From Virgil's admiring references
to the Neoclassical writers Pollio and Cinna, it has been inferred
that he was for a time associated with the Neoclassical circles of
Catullus. According to Servius, however, Virgil was regarded by his
schoolmates as <font color="#556b2f">extremely </font><font color="#6b8e23">shy
</font><font color="#556b2f">and reserved, </font>and was nicknamed
'<font color="#a0522d">Parthenias' </font>or 'maiden' <font color="#228b22">because
of his social aloofness</font>. Virgil seems to have suffered from
<font color="#191970">poor health </font>throughout his life and
lived a sort of invalid's life. According to Catalepton, he began
writing poetry while at the school of Siro Epicurus in Naples. The
small works attributed to the young Virgil by commentators have
survived under the name Appendix Vergiliana, but scholars consider
them largely forgeries. One of them, the Catalepton, consists of
<font color="#8b0000">fourteen </font>short poems, some of which may
have been written by Virgil, and another, a short narrative poem
called <font color="#483d8b">Culex </font>('The Mosquito'), was

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to the biographical
tradition, Virgil began the hexametric eclogues (or bucolic) in 42
BC, and the collection is believed to have been published around
39-38 <font color="#a9a9a9">BC, </font>although this is disputed. The
Eclogues (<font color="#dcdcdc">Greek for </font>'selections') are a
group of ten poems roughly modelled on the bucolic hexameter
('pastoral') poetry of the Hellenistic poet <font color="#2f4f4f">Theocritus.
</font>After his victory at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, the
Theocritus, a play by the Greek philosopher Tocritus, was written in
the style of the Theocritus. <font color="#556b2f">Octavian </font>tried
to pay his veterans from towns in <font color="#6b8e23">northern
Italy with </font>expropriated land, including, according to
tradition, a farm near Mantua owned by Virgil. Traditionally,
Virgil's motive for writing <font color="#a0522d">the eclogues has
been </font>thought to be the loss of his family estate and an
attempt to regain his property through poetic appeals. This is now
considered an implausible conclusion which is not supported by the
interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil does
indeed dramatise the conflicting emotions caused by the brutality of
the expropriation of the land using a pastoral idiom, but he does not
provide incontrovertible evidence of the supposed biographical event.
Although some readers have identified the poet himself with various
characters and their phases, whether it is the <font color="#228b22">gratitude
of </font>an old country boy to a new god (Ecl. 1), the frustrated
love of a country singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl.
2), or the songwriter's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl.
5), modern scholars largely reject such attempts to extract
biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret
the author's characters and themes as descriptions of contemporary
life and thought. The ten eclogues present traditional pastoral
themes from a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 deal with land
confiscation and its effects in rural Italy, while 2 and 3 are
pastoral and erotic, dealing with both homosexual love (<font color="#191970">eclogue
2</font>) and attraction to people of all genders (eclogue 3). The
so-called &quot;messianic eclogue &quot;4 addressed to <font color="#483d8b">Asinius
Pollio </font>uses the imagery of the Golden Age at the birth of a
child (who the child was to be is debated), 5 and 8 depict the myth
of Daphnis in a song contest, 6 the cosmic and mythological song of
Silenus, 7 a passionate poetry contest and 10 the sufferings of the
contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Virgil [who?] is believed
in the Eclogues to have established the Arcadian poetic ideal, which
still resonates in Western literature and the visual arts, and to
have laid the foundations for the development of Calpurnius Siculus,
Nemesias and later writers in the direction of the Latin pastoral.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At Maecenas' insistence (according
to tradition), Virgil spent the following years (perhaps 37-29 BC)
writing a long didactic hexameter poem, <font color="#dcdcdc">Georgics
</font>(from the Greek for &quot;Working the Earth&quot;), which he
dedicated to <font color="#2f4f4f">Maecenas</font>. The ostensible
subject of the Georgics is instruction <font color="#556b2f">in farm
management methods. </font>In dealing with this subject, Virgil
follows the didactic tradition ('how to') of the works and days of
the Greek poet Hesiod and of many later Hellenistic poets. The four
books of the Georgics focus on the cultivation <font color="#6b8e23">of
crops </font>and trees (1 and 2), on animal husbandry and horses (3),
and on <font color="#a0522d">beekeeping </font>and the properties of
bees (4). Famous passages include the beloved Laus Italiae in Book 2,
the description of the temple prologue in Book 3 and the description
of the plague at the end of Book 3. The book ends4 with a long
mythological story in the form of an epyllion, which vividly
describes <font color="#191970">Aristaeus' </font>discovery of
beekeeping and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld.
Ancient scholars, such as Servius, speculated that the Aristaeus
episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section praising
Virgil's friend, the poet <font color="#8b0000">Gallus, who </font>was

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">The Aeneid is
</font>widely regarded as Virgil's finest work and one of the most
important poems in the history of Western literature. Virgil worked
on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life29 (-19 BC),
and, according to Propertius, was commissioned by <font color="#2f4f4f">Augustus.
The </font>epic poem consists of a series of books12 written in
dactylic hexameter, describing the journey of Aeneas, a warrior
fleeing the sack of Troy, to Italy, his battle with the Italian
prince Turnus and the founding of the city from which Rome would
rise. The first six books of the Aeneid describe Aeneas' journey from
Troy to Rome. In writing his epic, Virgil used a number of models;
Homer, the most important author of the classical epic, is
omnipresent, but Virgil also makes particular reference to the Latin
poet <font color="#6b8e23">Ennius </font>and the Hellenistic poet
<font color="#a0522d">Apollonius of </font>Rhodes. Although the
Aeneid is strictly epic, it often seeks to expand the genre by
incorporating elements from other genres, such as tragedy and epic
poetry. Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to have divided
the Aeneid into two parts on the basis of Homer's poetry; the first
six books were seen as using the <font color="#191970">Odyssey as </font>a
model, while the last six books were associated with the <font color="#8b0000">Iliad.</font></p>

Odysseus episode) begins with a storm that <font color="#a9a9a9">Juno</font>,
Aeneas' enemy throughout the poem, is stirring up against the fleet.
The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, historically
Rome's deadliest enemy. Queen <font color="#dcdcdc">Dido </font>welcomes
the Roman ancestor and, under the influence of the gods, falls deeply
in love with him. In Book 2, Aeneas tells the enraptured
Carthaginians at a banquet about the Trojan raid, the death of his
wife and his flight, and in Book 3 he tells them about his wanderings
in the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter4
reminds the lingering Aeneas of her duty to <font color="#556b2f">found

leaving <font color="#a0522d">Dido </font>to commit <font color="#228b22">suicide</font>,
cursing Aeneas and summoning revenge in symbolic anticipation of the
fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. In Book 5, Anchises, Aeneas'
father, dies and is given a funeral. After arriving in Cumae, Italy,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Critics of the Aeneid focus on a
wide range of issues. In particular, there is a debate about the tone
of the poem as a whole; some see it as ultimately pessimistic and
politically subversive of Augustus' regime, while others see it as a
celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil draws on the
symbolism of Augustus' regime, and some scholars see strong links
between <font color="#a9a9a9">Augustus </font>and Aeneas, one as the
founder of Rome and the other as the re-founder. A strong teleology,
a striving towards a climax, has been identified in the poem. The
Aeneid is full of predictions about the future of Rome, the deeds of
Augustus, his ancestors and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian wars;
the Aeneid even describes Augustus' victory <font color="#dcdcdc">at
Actium </font>against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in <font color="#2f4f4f">31
BC.</font> Another area of study is the character of Aeneas. As the
protagonist of the poem, <font color="#556b2f">Aeneas </font>seems
constantly torn between his emotions and his commitment to fulfilling
his prophetic duty to found <font color="#6b8e23">Rome</font>;
critics note the breakdown of Aeneas' emotional control in the <font color="#a0522d">final
sections of the poem</font>, where the 'pious' and 'righteous' Aeneas
<font color="#228b22">mercilessly </font>slaughters <font color="#191970">Turnus</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to tradition, Virgil
travelled to <font color="#a9a9a9">Greece </font>around 19 BC to
check on the Aeneid. After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to
return home, Virgil fell ill with a <font color="#2f4f4f">fever </font>while
visiting a town near Megara. After travelling by ship <font color="#556b2f">to
Italy</font>, weakened by illness, Virgil died in the port of
<font color="#6b8e23">Brundisium on </font><font color="#a0522d">21
September 19 BC. </font>Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors,
<font color="#228b22">Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, </font>to
ignore Virgil's own wish <font color="#191970">to burn the poem </font>and
instead order it to be published with as few editorial changes as
possible. As a result, the existing text of the Aeneid may contain
errors that Virgil intended to correct before publication. The only
obvious flaws, however, are a few verses that are metrically
incomplete (i.e. not a full dactylic hexameter line). Some scholars
have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete
lines for dramatic effect. Other alleged incompletenesses are the
subject of scholarly debate.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Virgil's works revolutionised Latin
poetry almost as soon as they were published. <font color="#a9a9a9">The
Eclogues</font>, the Georgics and, above all, the Aeneid became
standard texts in school curricula, familiar to all educated Romans.
Poets who followed Virgil often referred to his works intertextually
to create meanings for their own poetry. In Amores 1.1.1-2, the
Augustan poet <font color="#dcdcdc">Ovid </font>parodied the opening
lines of the Aeneid, and his summary of the Aeneid in Metamorphoses
14, the so-called 'mini-Aeneid', has been considered a particularly
significant example of a post-Virgilian response to the epic genre.
Lucan's epic Bellum Civile has been seen as an anti-Virgilian epic
that abandons the divine mechanism, deals with historical events and
departs sharply from Virgil's epic practice. The Flavian poet
Statius, in his 12-volume epic Thebaid, is closely associated with
Virgil's poetry; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to 'compete
with the divine Aeneid, but to follow from afar and always respect
its footsteps'. <font color="#556b2f">In Silius Italicus, </font>Virgil
finds one of his most ardent admirers. In almost every line of <font color="#6b8e23">his
Punica epic, </font><font color="#a0522d">Silius </font>refers to
Virgil. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Virgil's tomb and
worshipped the poet. Partly <font color="#228b22">thanks to </font>his
so-called 'messianic' <font color="#228b22">fourth eclogue - </font>later
interpreted as predicting the birth of Jesus Christ - Virgil was
later in antiquity considered to have the magical powers of a seer;
the Sortes Vergilianae, the process by which Virgil's poetry was used
as an aid to divination, dates back to the time of Hadrian and
continued into <font color="#191970">the Middle Ages.</font>
Similarly, in his Saturnalia, Macrobius believes that Virgil's work
is the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, reflecting the
Greek view of Homer. Virgil also found commentators in antiquity.
Servius, a commentator of the <font color="#8b0000">4th century AD</font>,
based his work on Donatus' commentary. Servius' commentary provides
us with a wealth of information about Virgil's life, sources and
references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality
of his work and often simplistic interpretations frustrating.</p>

originated in <font color="#dcdcdc">the Middle Ages, and is </font>often
seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the topos of Woman
Power, which shows the disturbing power of a woman's attraction to

sometimes described as the <font color="#2f4f4f">emperor's daughter
</font>or mistress, called <font color="#556b2f">Lucretius</font>.
She tricked him into agreeing to meet her at his house, where he was
to sneak in at night by climbing into a large basket lowered from the
window. When he did so, he was only half lifted up the wall and left
trapped until the next day, when he was exposed to public ridicule.

Empire and the Middle Ages, </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Virgil </font>was
spelled Virgilius. Two explanations are generally given for this
change. One is due to a false etymology of the word virgo (&quot;maiden&quot;
in Latin), which was due to Virgil's excessive, &quot;maiden-like&quot;
modesty. Alternatively, some argue that Virgil was changed to Virgil
by analogy with the Latin word virga ('rod') because Virgil was
believed to have magical or prophetic powers in the Middle Ages (this
explanation, however, is found in only a few manuscripts and was
probably not widespread). <font color="#2f4f4f">In Norman schools
</font>(following French practice), it was customary to anglicise
Latin names by omitting their Latin endings, so Virgil was Virgil. <font color="#556b2f">In

<font color="#a0522d">the United States </font>suggested the change
to Vergil, as it is closer to his original name and is also the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The brains of all species are mainly
made up of two broad categories of cells: <font color="#a9a9a9">neurons
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">and glial cells</font>. There are
several types of glial cells (also called <font color="#2f4f4f">glia
or neuroglia</font>) and they have several critical functions, such
as structural support, metabolic support, insulation and
developmental control. However, neurons are generally considered to
be the most important cells in the brain. What makes neurons unique
is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long
distances. They send these signals by means of an axon, a thin
protoplasmic filament that extends from the cell body and is usually
extended by numerous branches to other regions, sometimes close,
sometimes far away in the brain or body. The length of an axon can be
exceptionally long: for example, if a cortical pyramidal cell
(excitatory neuron) were enlarged so that its cell body was the size
of a human body, its axon, when similarly enlarged, would become a
cable a few centimetres in diameter, stretching over a kilometre.
These axons transmit signals as electrochemical pulses, called <font color="#556b2f">action
potentials, which </font>last less than a thousandth of a second and
travel along the axon <font color="#6b8e23">at a speed of 1-100
metres per second</font>. Some neurons emit action potentials
continuously, at 10-100 per second, usually in irregular patterns;
other neurons are silent most of the time but emit an occasional
action potential burst.</p>

two approaches: first, <font color="#a9a9a9">using computers to study
the brain and second, studying how the brain performs computation.</font>
On the one hand, it is possible to write a computer program that
simulates the activity of a group of neurons using sets of equations
that describe their electrochemical activity; such simulations are
called biologically realistic neural networks. On the other hand, it
is possible to study neural computing algorithms by simulating or
mathematically analysing the behaviour of simplified &quot;units&quot;
that have some properties of neurons but do not contain much of their
biological complexity. Both computer scientists and neuroscientists
study the computational functions of the brain.</p>

</font><font color="#a9a9a9">physician Galenos </font>also spoke
about the importance of the brain and presented in-depth theories on
how it works. Galen explained the anatomical relationships between
the brain, nerves and muscles and showed that all the muscles of the
body are connected to the brain by a branching network of nerves. He
proposed that nerves mechanically activate muscles by transporting a
mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, usually translated
as '<font color="#2f4f4f">animal spirits</font>'. Galen's ideas were
widely known in the Middle Ages, but were not developed until <font color="#556b2f">the
Renaissance</font>, when detailed anatomical research continued and
was combined with the theoretical speculations of René Descartes and
his followers. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system
in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions
were performed by the non-physical res cogitans, but that most human
and all animal behaviour could be explained mechanically.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, the first real advance
towards a modern understanding of how the nervous system works came
from <font color="#a9a9a9">Luigi Galvan's </font>research, when he
discovered that a static electric shock to a nerve exposed in a dead
frog caused its leg to contract. Since then, every major advance in
our understanding of the nervous system has followed more or less
directly from the development of new research techniques. Until the
early years of the 20th century, the main advances came from new
methods of staining cells. Particularly decisive was the invention of<font color="#dcdcdc">
Golgi staining</font>, which (when used correctly) stains only a
small part of the neuron but stains the whole cell, including the
cell body, dendrites and axon. Without such staining, brain tissue
appears under the microscope as an impenetrable jumble of
protoplasmic fibres, from which it is impossible to determine any
structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and in particular <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Spanish </font>neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new
staining revealed hundreds of different types of neurons, each with
its own unique dendritic structure and connectivity pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Until around <font color="#a9a9a9">1855,
the words </font>Middle East and Far East did not refer to any
particular region. Far East, an expression containing the noun east,
defined by the adjective far away, could mean any place in the 'far
east' of the speaker's home area. For example, the Ottoman Empire was
as much the Far East as the East Indies. The <font color="#dcdcdc">Crimean
War </font>brought a change in vocabulary, with the introduction of
more familiar terms in the late 19th century. The Russian Empire had
entered a more aggressive phase, becoming militarily active against
<font color="#2f4f4f">the Ottoman Empire </font>and also China, with
the explicit aim of territorial expansion. The <font color="#556b2f">British
government </font>redefined its policy on the basis that the two
countries under attack were essential to the balance of power. It
therefore took up arms against the Russians in both places, and one
of the results was the Crimean War. During that war, the <font color="#6b8e23">British
imperial </font>administration began to promulgate a new vocabulary,
giving a specific territorial meaning to 'Middle East', the Ottoman
Empire, and 'Far East', the East Indies. The two terms were now
compound nouns, often presented with a hyphen.</p>

book was a great success, he went with his wife to the Balkans in
1896 to develop details for a sequel, The People and Politics of the
Near East, which Scribners planned to publish in 1897. Mrs Norman,
herself a writer, wrote glowing letters about the home of Mme Zakki,
'the wife of a Turkish minister', and about a person she described as
a cultured woman living in a country home full of books. The natives

Scribner's Magazine </font>in <font color="#dcdcdc">June 1896.</font>
The empire had been reduced from an enlightened civilisation that
ruled the barbarians for their own good to something far inferior.
The difference was the Hamidian massacres, which were going on even
while the couple were travelling in the Balkans. Now, according to
Norman, the empire had been established by a 'Muslim horde' from
Asia, stopped by 'fearless Hungary'. Moreover, &quot;Greece shook off
the turbaned destroyer of her people&quot; and so on. The <font color="#556b2f">Russians
</font>were suddenly the liberators of the oppressed Balkan states.
Describing the Armenians as revolutionaries in the name of freedom
who expected to be saved by the intervention of Christian Europe, he
says that &quot;but their hope was vain&quot;. <font color="#6b8e23">England
</font>had 'turned her back'. Norman concluded his exhortation with
the words 'in the Balkans you learn to hate the Turks'. Norman made
sure Gladstone read the article. Prince Nicolas of Montenegro wrote a

change British policy, perhaps William Miller (<font color="#a9a9a9">1864-1945)</font>,
a journalist and <font color="#dcdcdc">Middle East </font>expert, did
the most work. In essence, he <font color="#2f4f4f">signed the death
warrant, so to speak, of the age of empires</font>. The fall of the
Ottoman Empire eventually enveloped all other empires. In Travel and
Politics in the Near East (1898), Miller claimed to have made four
trips to the Balkans, in 1894, 1896, 1897 and 1898, and to be
essentially an expert on the 'Middle East', by which he primarily
meant the Balkans. Apart from the fact that he went to <font color="#556b2f">Oxford
</font>and played rugby, not much other biographical detail is given.
He was effectively (regardless of whether he had any formal

Countless places seem to have had a Middle East from gardens to

to mean the territories of the Ottoman Empire as early as the Crimean
War, had left a geographical gap. The East Indies or 'Far East'
ultimately derived from <font color="#2f4f4f">Ptolemy's 'India beyond
the Ganges'. The </font>Ottoman Empire ended <font color="#556b2f">at

&quot;Middle East&quot; because of the <font color="#6b8e23">discovery

coexisted, but were not always considered separate. <font color="#dcdcdc">Bertram
Lenox Simpson, a </font>colonial officer who eventually died in
China, in his 1910 book The Conflict of Colour, uses the terms
together as 'Middle East and Near East'. The entire super-region
consisted of 'India, Afghanistan, Persia, Arabistan, Asia Minor, and
last but not least, Egypt'. Simpson (pseudonym <font color="#2f4f4f">Weale</font>)
explains that this whole area 'is politically one region - despite
the divisions into which it is academically divided'. His own term
resurrects the 'Middle East' as the opposite of the 'Far East'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The basis of Simpson's unity is
<font color="#a9a9a9">colour and colonialist subjugation</font>. His
colour chart identifies a spectrum of black, brown and yellow that
had been traditional at the time since the late 19th century. In
addition to these, there was the &quot;great white race&quot;, which
the moderate Simpson tones down as simply the white race. The Great
Whites still appeared in the <font color="#dcdcdc">1920s </font>in
the works of <font color="#2f4f4f">James Henry Breasted</font>, which
were taught as the gospel of ancient history throughout the first
half of the 20th century. The <font color="#556b2f">red wavelength
</font>was mainly of interest in America. Simpson coined the term
&quot;The Problem of the Nearer East&quot;, which had nothing to do
with the Ottomans and everything to do with British colonialism.

out. The Ottomans were portrayed <font color="#a9a9a9">as slave

were striking out against Barbary pirates for freedom, their own

of 1947 from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which provided
both military intelligence and covert military operations to the
military during the World War II crisis. Since then, there have been
many revisions and redefinitions. Although the CIA's name reflects
the original advisory intent of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Harry S. Truman, the government's need for strategic services has
thwarted that intent from the beginning. In countless articles,
novels and other media, the press has sought to create various
popular myths about the agency; for example, that this agency has
replaced all intelligence activities other than the OSS or that it
contains the core intelligence capability of the United States.
Strategic services are formally provided by some 17 agencies, known
as the Intelligence Community. The Army's intelligence services did
not end; in fact, all branches of the armed services retained their
intelligence services. This community is currently run (in addition
to all other management) by the Office of the Director of National

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The region of modern Zhejiang was
outside the great sphere of influence of the Shang civilisation in
the second millennium BC. Instead, this region was inhabited by
peoples collectively known as the <font color="#a9a9a9">Sata Yue</font>,
including Dongyue and Ouyue. The Yue kingdom began to appear in
chronicles and records written during the <font color="#dcdcdc">spring
and autumn. </font>According to chronicles, the Yue kingdom was
located <font color="#2f4f4f">in the northern part of Zhejiang</font>.
Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from Yu<font color="#556b2f">
the Great</font>, the founder of Shang. Evidence suggests that Baiyue
and the Kingdom of Yue had their own culture and history, which
differed from those of the Northern and Central China Kingdoms, whose
culture and history were carefully recorded in chronicles and
historical records during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Qin
Dynasty. The Song of the Yue Boatman (Chinese <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">越人歌</font>,
p Yuèrén Gē, lit. 'Song of the Yue Man') was translated into
Chinese and written by authors in northern or inner China in the
Hebei and Henan regions around 528 BC. The song reveals that the Yue
people spoke a language that was incompatible with the dialects
spoken in northern and central China. The Yue people seem to have had
their own written script. The Goujian sword has a <font color="#6b8e23">bird-worm
cuneiform inscription.</font> Yuenü (Chinese: <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">越女</font>;
pinyin: Yuènǚ; Wade-Giles: Yüeh-nü; literally: &quot;Yue woman&quot;)
was a swordwoman from the Yue state. To curb the growth of the Wu
Kingdom, Chu pursued a policy of strengthening Yue. Under King
Goujian, Yue recovered from its early defeats and fully annexed the
lands of its rivals in 473 BC. The Yue kings then moved their capital
centre from its original home around Mount Kuaiji in present-day
Shaoxing to the former capital of Wu in present-day Suzhou. Since the
southern power had no force to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it
directly and succeeded in 333 BC in destroying it. The Qin Empire
annexed the former lands of Yue in 222 BC and organised them into a
command, named after Kuaiji in Zhejiang, but initially headquartered
at Wu in Jiangsu.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the fall of Wu and the turmoil
of the Wu Hu rebellion against the <font color="#a9a9a9">Jin dynasty
</font>(<font color="#dcdcdc">265-420), </font>most of the Chinese
elite had collaborated with non-Chinese rulers and military
conquerors in the north. Some may have lost their social privileges
and fled to areas south of the Yangtze River. Some Chinese refugees
from northern China may have settled in areas near Hangzhou. For
example, the clan of <font color="#2f4f4f">Zhuge Liang </font>(<font color="#556b2f">181-234),
a </font>Shu Han State Chancellor from the Central Plain of North
China during the Three Kingdoms, gathered in the suburbs of Hangzhou
to form an exclusive closed <font color="#6b8e23">Zhuge village
(Zhege Cun), </font>consisting of villagers all with the surname
'Zhuge'. The village has deliberately isolated itself from the
surrounding communities for centuries <font color="#a0522d">until
today, </font>and only <font color="#228b22">recently did it </font>come
into the public eye. It suggests that a small number of influential,
elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plains may have sought refuge
south of the Yangtze River. However, given <font color="#191970">the
mountainous </font>geography and relative scarcity of agricultural
land in Zhejiang, most of these refugees may have settled in some
areas of southern China outside Zhejiang where fertile agricultural
land and metropolitan resources were available, mainly in northern
Jiangsu, western Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui and provinces where
there had been less coherent and organised regional governments.
Sichuan's metropolitan areas were another refugee focus, as Shu State
had long been established and was dominated by the political and
military elites of central and northern Sichuan and China. Some
refugees from northern China may have found a settlement in southern
China, depending on their social status and military power in the
north. The Jin trunk state or the southern dynasties competed with
some of the Chinese elites of the central plains and south of the
Yangtze River.</p>

The canal regularly transported grain and natural resources from
Zhejiang via its capital Hangzhou (and its hinterland on both the

War led to the defeat of the Tang by the Sui, who then led the

economic centre in the eastern district of Jiangnan, and was
considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the Tang Dynasty, the
Great Canal had remained efficient, transporting grain and material
resources to the North China Plain and the metropolitan centres of
the empire. With the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, Zhejiang formed
the bulk of the territory of the Wuyue Regional Kingdom.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Zhejiang's main manufacturing
industries are electromechanical, textiles, chemicals, food
processing and building materials. In recent years, Zhejiang has
followed its own development model, known as the &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Zhejiang
Model&quot;</font>, based on prioritising and encouraging
<font color="#dcdcdc">entrepreneurship</font>, emphasising small
enterprises responsive to market whims, large public investment in
infrastructure and mass production of low-cost goods for both
domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made
itself one of the richest provinces and the &quot;Zhejiang spirit&quot;
has become something of a legend in China. However, some economists
are now concerned that this model is not sustainable because it is
inefficient and places excessive demands on raw materials and public
services, and that it is also a dead end because Zhejiang's myriad
small businesses, which produce cheap goods in bulk, are unable to
move into more advanced or technologically advanced industries.
Zhejiang's economic centre is shifting from Hangzhou in northern
Zhejiang to the <font color="#2f4f4f">south-east of </font>Wenzhou
and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urban residents in
Zhejiang was 24 611 yuan (US$ 3 603) in 2009, with an annual real
growth rate of <font color="#6b8e23">8.3%.</font> The net per capita
income of rural residents was 10 007 yuan (1 465 USD), with an annual
real growth rate of 8.1%. Zhejiang's nominal GDP in 2011 was <font color="#a0522d">3.20
trillion </font>yuan (USD 506 <font color="#228b22">billion</font>)
and GDP per capita was 44 335 yuan (USD 6 490). In 2009, the value of
Zhejiang's primary, secondary and tertiary industries was 116.2
billion yuan (17 billion USD), 1.1843 trillion yuan (173.4 billion
USD) and 982.7 billion yuan (143.9 billion USD) respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The third report of the Defence
Committee, &quot;Defence Equipment 2009&quot;, quotes an article
published on the Financial Times website, according to which the
Chief of Defence Equipment, <font color="#a9a9a9">General Sir Kevin
O'Donoghue</font>, had issued an internal memo instructing <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Chief of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S</font>) staff to
reprioritize the approval process to focus on supporting current
operations over the next three years, deterrence-related programs,
programs that reflect defense-related obligations both treaty and
international, and programs for which production contracts have
already been awarded. The report also identifies concerns about
possible cuts to the defence science and technology research budget,
the impact of inappropriate assessment of defence inflation in
budgetary processes, the underfunding of the <font color="#2f4f4f">equipment
programme </font>and general concerns about striking the right
balance between the short-term priority (current operations) and the
long-term consequences of not investing in the delivery of the UK's
future defence capabilities for future combat forces and campaigns.
The then Defence Secretary, <font color="#556b2f">Bob Ainsworth </font><font color="#6b8e23">MP</font>,
confirmed this reprioritisation of the focus on current operations
and had not ruled out <font color="#a0522d">&quot;major changes&quot;
</font>in defence spending. In the same article, the Chief of Naval
Staff and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope of the
Royal Navy, admitted that <font color="#228b22">there was not enough
money in the defence budget </font>and that it was preparing for
difficult decisions and possible cuts. According to figures published
in <font color="#191970">the London Evening Standard, the </font>defence
budget for 2009 is &quot;<font color="#8b0000">over-spent by more
than 10%&quot; </font>(figures cannot be verified), and according to

be cut. The Ministry of Defence has invested in <font color="#483d8b">information

</font><font color="#a9a9a9">High Definition Television Service </font>began
trials in August 1936 and regular service on 2 November 1936 using
both the (mechanical) Baird 240-line sequential scanning system
(later inaccurately called &quot;progressive&quot;) and the
(electronic) Marconi EMI 405-line interleaved system. The Baird
system was discontinued <font color="#2f4f4f">in February 1937. </font>In
1938 <font color="#556b2f">France </font>introduced its own 441-line
system, variations of which were also used in several other
countries. The US NTSC 525-line system was introduced in 1941. In
1949, France introduced the even higher resolution 819-line standard,
which should have been a high definition system even by today's
standards, but it was only monochrome, and the <font color="#a0522d">technical
limitations of </font>the time prevented it from achieving the
resolution it should have been capable of. All these systems used
interlacing and a 4:3 aspect ratio, except the 240-line system, which
was progressive (the technically correct term at the time was
'sequential'), and the 405-line system, which started with a 5:4
ratio and later changed to a 4:3 ratio. The <font color="#228b22">405-line
</font><font color="#191970">system introduced the </font>revolutionary
(at the time) idea of interlaced scanning to solve the flicker
problem of the 240-line system at a frame rate of 25 Hz. The 240-line
system could have doubled its frame rate, but this would have meant
doubling the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, which was not an
acceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth had to be 3 MHz or
less.</p>
