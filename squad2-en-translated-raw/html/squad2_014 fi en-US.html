<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Affirmative action in the US tends
to focus on issues such as <font color="#a9a9a9">education </font>and
employment, with particular attention to <font color="#dcdcdc">racial
minorities</font>, Native Americans and women, who have been
historically marginalised groups in America. Reports have shown that
minorities and women have been discriminated against in schools and
businesses for years, and this discrimination has given <font color="#2f4f4f">whites
and men an </font>unfair advantage in education and employment. The
impetus for positive action is to address the harms of past and
present discrimination. There is also a desire to ensure <font color="#556b2f">that
</font>public institutions such as universities, hospitals and police
forces are <font color="#6b8e23">more representative of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Affirmative action is a
controversial subject. Some policies adopted as affirmative action,
such as racial or <font color="#a9a9a9">gender quotas </font>in
college admissions, have been criticized as a form of <font color="#dcdcdc">reverse
</font>discrimination, and such affirmative action has been found
unconstitutional in the majority opinion in <font color="#2f4f4f">Gratz
v. Bollinger</font>. The Supreme Court upheld affirmative action as a
practice in its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger. Affirmative
action policies were developed to remedy decades of discrimination
dating back to <font color="#556b2f">the Reconstruction era </font>by
giving disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the
diversity of contemporary American society suggests that affirmative
action policies have succeeded and are no longer needed. Opponents of
affirmative action argue that these policies are outdated and lead to
<font color="#6b8e23">reverse </font>discrimination, favoring one
group over another <font color="#a0522d">based on </font>racial
preference rather than <font color="#a0522d">merit.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The idea of affirmative action was
born during the Reconstruction period (<font color="#a9a9a9">1865-1877)</font>,
when the former slave population lacked the skills and resources
needed for a sustainable life. In 1865, <font color="#2f4f4f">General
</font><font color="#556b2f">William Tecumseh Sherman </font>proposed
that Georgia's lands and goods be divided and allotted to families of
color, which became the &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">40 acres and
mule</font>&quot; policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due
to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s),
the civil rights movement saw the re-emergence of policies to help
different social classes. Civil rights guarantees came through the
interpretation of the <font color="#a0522d">equal protection clause
of the 14th Amendment</font>. The decisions became known as
affirmative action, where mandatory as well as voluntary programs
strengthened the civil rights of people of color. In addition, these
affirmative action programs protected people of color from the
current effects of past discrimination. In 1961, <font color="#228b22">President
John F. Kennedy </font>first used the term &quot;affirmative action&quot;
in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that public contractors &quot;take
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and employees
are treated during employment without regard to their race, religion,
color, or national origin.&quot; This executive order implemented the
government's intent to create equal opportunity for all qualified
people. This executive order was amended and eventually replaced by
Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246, which prohibited
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, and national
origin in organizations receiving federal contracts and subcontracts.
In 1967, the order was amended to include sex. The Reagan
administration opposed the affirmative action requirements of
Executive Order 11246, but these proposed changes met with bipartisan
opposition in Congress.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The term &quot;affirmative action&quot;
first appeared in the <font color="#a9a9a9">National Labor Relations
Act of </font>1935, better known as the Wagner Act.15 Proposed and
championed by New York <font color="#2f4f4f">Senator Robert F.
Wagner, </font>the Wagner Act responded to President Roosevelt's goal
of providing economic security for workers and other low-income
groups. During this period, it was not uncommon for employers to
blacklist or fire <font color="#556b2f">unionized workers. The </font>Wagner
Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of discrimination and
empowered the <font color="#6b8e23">National Labor Relations Board </font>to
review potential cases of employee discrimination. In cases of
discrimination, employees had to be restored to their proper position
in the company through &quot;affirmative action.&quot; While the
Wagner Act protected employees and unions, it did not protect
<font color="#a0522d">minorities, who, with </font>the exception of
the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often excluded from
the ranks of unions.11 This original coining of the term thus has
little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but
it helped lay the groundwork for any policy designed to compensate or
remedy unfair treatment of individuals.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">FDR's New Deal programs often
included equal opportunity clauses stating that &quot;discrimination
shall not be practiced on the basis of race, color, or religion&quot;:11
but the real pioneer of affirmative action was then <font color="#a9a9a9">Secretary
of the Interior </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Harold L. Ickes</font>.
Ickes banned discrimination in the hiring of Public Works
Administration-funded projects and oversaw the quota system devised
by Robert C. Weaver and Clark Foreman, which required contractors to
<font color="#2f4f4f">hire a percentage of black workers</font>,12
but also the equal pay for women proposed by Harry Hopkins.14DR's
greatest contribution to affirmative action, however, was his
<font color="#556b2f">Executive Order 8802</font>, which prohibited
discrimination in the defense industry or government.:22 The
executive order promoted the idea that if taxpayer funds were
accepted through a government contract, all taxpayers should have
equal opportunity to work through a contractor.:23-4 To implement
this idea, Roosevelt established the Fair <font color="#6b8e23">Employment
Practices Committee </font>(FEPC), which had the authority to
investigate the hiring practices of government contractors.:22</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After <font color="#a9a9a9">the case
of Sergeant Isaac Woodard, </font>President Harry S. Truman, himself
a World War I veteran, issued Executive Order 9808, establishing the
<font color="#dcdcdc">President's Commission on Civil Rights </font>to
investigate the violence and recommend appropriate federal
legislation. Upon hearing of the case, Truman turned to NAACP leader
Walter Francis White and declared, &quot;Oh, my God! I had no idea it
was this horrible. We have to do something.&quot; In <font color="#2f4f4f">1947,
the </font>committee published its findings, To Secure These Rights.
The book was widely read, influential, and considered utopian for its
time: &quot;In our country, people are equal, but they are free to be
different. It is from these differences between our peoples that
America's great human and national strength springs.&quot; The report
addressed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms,
education, public accommodations, personal safety and employment
opportunities. The Committee was concerned about <font color="#556b2f">the
state of race relations, </font>citing, among other things, the
evacuation of Japanese Americans during the war, &quot;which was done
without trial or any kind of hearing... The basis of our whole system
of justice is the belief that guilt is a matter of personal and not
of heredity or association&quot;. The recommendations were radical,
calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination
and bring about equality: &quot;We cannot tolerate any restrictions
on an individual based on irrelevant factors such as race, colour,
religion or the social status into which he was born.&quot; To Secure
These Rights set for the next generation a liberal legislative agenda

taken by executive departments and agencies to more fully implement
the national policy of nondiscrimination.&quot;.... The contractor
will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and
that employees are treated during employment without regard to race,
religion, color or national origin. &quot;60 The Executive Order also
established the President<font color="#a0522d">'s Committee on Equal
Employment Opportunity </font>(PCEEO), chaired by Vice President
Lyndon B. Johnson. Federal contractors who failed to comply with or
violated the executive order were punished <font color="#228b22">by
cancellation of the contract </font>and possible debarment from
future government contracts. The administration &quot;did not insist
on any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities&quot;
but rather &quot;advocated race-neutral hiring to end job
discrimination. &quot;61 Turning to women's rights issues, Kennedy
established the Commission on the Status of Women in December 1961.
The commission was charged with &quot;examining the employment
policies and practices of government and contractors&quot; in

This contract was the administration's model for a &quot;plan for

contractors, such as Boeing and General Electric, to sign similar
voluntary contracts announcing progress plans. But these plans were

Latinos are worse off than white Americans and more likely to live in

graduation rate, while the African American rate increased by <font color="#6b8e23">12%

were considered &quot;white&quot; under Jim Crow laws during the
Reconstruction era. In other cases, Latinos have been classified as
an inferior race and a threat to white purity, according to Paul
Brest. Latinos have faced significant discrimination in areas such as
employment, housing and education. According to Brest, stereotypes
are still largely negative, with many perceiving Latinos as &quot;lazy,
unproductive and unemployed&quot;. In addition, native-born Latinos
and recent immigrants are seen as similar because outsiders generally

and discrimination because they were <font color="#a9a9a9">not given
the opportunity to acquire citizenship</font>. They also had to
contend with many of the same school segregation laws that
African-Americans faced. In particular, during World War II, Japanese
Americans were interned in camps and lost their property, homes and
businesses. Discrimination against Asians began with <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 </font>and continued with the Scott Act
of 1888 and the Geary Act of 1892. In the early 1900s, the United
States passed the <font color="#556b2f">Immigration Act of 1924 </font>to
prevent Asian immigration, fearing that Asians would steal white jobs
and lower wages. Moreover, whites and non-Asians do not distinguish
between different Asian groups and perpetuate the stereotype of the
&quot;model minority&quot;. According to a 2010 article by Fairfield
University professor Qin Zhang, Asians are characterised as
one-dimensional because they have a good work ethic and value
education, but lack <font color="#6b8e23">communication skills and
personality</font>. A negative consequence of this stereotype is that
Asians are portrayed as poor leaders and interpersonal skills. This
has contributed to the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; phenomenon where,
although there are many qualified Asian-Americans, there are
disproportionately few of them in management positions in companies.
In addition, the model minority stereotype has led to a resentment of
Asian success, with many universities and colleges restricting or
blaming Asian entry.</p>

employers and companies will gain a competitive advantage in an

employers have found that a diverse workforce makes a company
&quot;stronger, more profitable and a better place to work.&quot; As
a result, these diversity policies are implemented for competitive
reasons rather than in response to discrimination, but they have
demonstrated the value of diversity.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to a 2000 study by the
American Association of <font color="#dcdcdc">University Professors
</font>(AAUP), affirmative action promoted diversity in colleges and
universities<font color="#a9a9a9">. </font>This has been shown to
have a <font color="#2f4f4f">positive impact on the educational
outcomes and experiences of college students and the </font><font color="#556b2f">teaching
of faculty members. </font>According to a study by Geoffrey Maruyama
and José F. Moreno, the results showed that faculty members believed
that diversity <font color="#6b8e23">helped students achieve the key
goals of a university education</font>, that <font color="#a0522d">white
students were </font>not adversely affected by classroom diversity,
and that attention to multicultural learning enhanced the ability of
colleges and universities to fulfill their missions. In addition,
diverse students offer unique perspectives that can challenge
preconceptions by learning about the experiences and ideas of others.
According to Professor Gurin of the University of Michigan, studying
with a heterogeneous group of students can potentially develop skills
such as &quot;perspective taking, acceptance of difference,
willingness and ability to find commonalities in differences,
acceptance of conflict as normal, conflict resolution, participation
in democracy and interest in the wider social world&quot;. In
addition, broadening perspectives helps students to confront personal
and content stereotypes and promotes discussion of racial and ethnic
issues in the classroom. In addition, a <font color="#228b22">2000
</font>AAUP study found that a diversity of perspectives leads to
better discussion and greater understanding among students of issues
related to race, tolerance, justice, etc.</p>

</font>argues that artificially placing minority pupils in schools

to their failure and <font color="#dcdcdc">high drop-out rates</font>.
For example, about half of black college students rank in <font color="#2f4f4f">the

times </font>more likely to fail the bar exam than whites, and
interracial friendships are more likely to form between students with
relatively similar levels of academic preparation; thus, blacks and
Hispanics are more likely to integrate socially on campuses where
their academic preparation is less poor. He argues that the supposed
&quot;beneficiaries&quot; of affirmative action - minorities - do not
actually benefit but rather suffer. Sander's claims have been
disputed and his empirical analyses have been heavily criticised. A
group including some of the country's leading experts on statistical
methodology told the Supreme Court that Sander's analyses were so
flawed that the court would be wise to ignore them altogether.

&quot;Most justifications for affirmative action fall into two

He also argues that affirmative action carries a stigma that can

Eastland believes that affirmative action is a big risk that only
sometimes pays off, and that without it we could compete more freely
with each other. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his book
Affirmative Action Around the World, identifies the negative
consequences of affirmative action: an empirical study. Sowell writes
that affirmative action policies encourage non-privileged groups to
designate themselves as members of privileged groups [i.e. primary
beneficiaries] in order to benefit from group preference policies;
that they tend to primarily benefit the most fortunate of privileged
groups (e.g. that they tend to benefit primarily those in the most
privileged groups (e.g. upper and middle class blacks), often at the
expense of those in the least privileged groups (e.g. poor whites or
Asians); that they reduce the incentives for both the privileged and

affirmative action counterproductive. One argument against reverse

be offered not to the most qualified applicants but to applicants
with a particular characteristic, such as a particular race,
ethnicity or gender. Opponents say, for example, that affirmative
action leads to the admission of unqualified applicants to highly
demanding institutions or jobs, which ultimately leads to failure
(see, for example, Richard Sander's study on affirmative action in
law school, the bar exam, and potential success in law firms). Other
opponents argue that affirmative action lowers the bar and thus

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Another popular argument in favour
of positive action is the <font color="#a9a9a9">compensation
argument</font>. Blacks were mistreated in the past because of a
morally irrelevant black characteristic, so <font color="#dcdcdc">modern
society should compensate for the insults</font>. This creates
reverse discrimination in the form of preferential pay, contracts and
grants as a means of redressing past wrongs. Many opponents argue
that this form of reparation is morally untenable because if blacks
were harmed in the past for being black, <font color="#2f4f4f">preferential
treatment for that same characteristic is illogical. </font>Furthermore,
arguments are made that <font color="#556b2f">whites today, who
innocently benefited from past wrongs, should not be punished for
something over which they had no control. </font>Therefore, they are
being discriminated against in reverse, because they are receiving
the punishment that should be meted out to <font color="#6b8e23">people
who knowingly and willingly benefited from discriminatory practices.</font></p>

increase racial tensions </font>and benefit the more privileged in
minority groups at the expense of the disenfranchised in more

In 2006, nearly <font color="#6b8e23">60% of </font>Michigan voters
decided to ban affirmative action in university admissions. Michigan
joined California, Florida, Texas and Washington in banning racial or
gender-based admissions. Some opponents believe, among other things,
that affirmative action devalues the achievements of people who
belong to the group it is intended to help, and thus makes
affirmative action harmful. In addition, opponents of affirmative
action argue that such action dehumanizes individuals and that job or

the individual.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Following the Hopwood v. Texas
ruling, <font color="#a9a9a9">which banned racial assessment in
school admissions</font>, the state of Texas passed a law
guaranteeing <font color="#dcdcdc">admission to any state university
if a student ranked in the top 10% of his or her graduating class</font>.
Florida and <font color="#2f4f4f">California </font>have also
replaced racial quotas <font color="#556b2f">with class ranking </font>and
other criteria. Class rank tends to benefit top students from less
competitive high schools at the expense of students from more
competitive high schools. However, this effect may be intentional, as
less funded and less competitive schools are more likely to have high
minority populations. Critics argue that <font color="#6b8e23">class
ranking </font>is more a measure of peers than of self. The top 10%
rule increases racial diversity only because schools remain highly
segregated by housing patterns. The class ranking rule has the same
effect as traditional affirmative action: it opens schools to
students who would not otherwise have gotten in if that school had
used a holistic, merit-based approach. Between 1996 and 1998, Texas
state universities admitted merit-based students, and minority
admissions declined. When the state adopted the &quot;10% cap&quot;

Richard H. Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of
<font color="#dcdcdc">the Stanford Law Review </font>questioning the
effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools. He noted that
prior to his article, there had been no comprehensive research on the
effects of affirmative action. The article presents research showing
that <font color="#2f4f4f">half of all black law students rank near
the bottom of their class after the first year of law school </font>and
that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and
fail the bar exam. The article presents a preliminary estimate that
the number of new black lawyers in the United States would increase
by <font color="#556b2f">8% </font>if affirmative action programs at
all law schools were discontinued. Less qualified black students
would go to less prestigious schools where their abilities would be
more in line with those of their classmates and where they would
therefore perform relatively better. Sander helped develop an
affirmative action plan for UCLA's law school based on socioeconomic
background after the 1996 passage of <font color="#6b8e23">Assembly
Bill 209</font>, which banned racial preferences at California public

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 2012, Louisiana State University
student Abigail Fisher and Southern Methodist University law student
Rachel Multer Michalewicz filed a lawsuit against the <font color="#a9a9a9">University
of Texas' </font>admissions policy, claiming it engaged in
&quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">race-conscious policies</font>&quot; that
&quot;violated <font color="#2f4f4f">their </font><font color="#556b2f">civil
and constitutional </font><font color="#2f4f4f">rights</font>&quot;.
The University of Texas applies the &quot;Top Ten Percent Law&quot;,
which guarantees admission to all Texas public colleges and
universities to high school students who graduate in the top ten
percent of their high school class. Fisher has taken the admissions
policy to court because he believes he was denied admission to the
University of Texas on the basis of his race, and thus his 14th
Amendment right to equal protection was violated. The Supreme Court
heard oral arguments from Fisher on October 10, 2012, and issued an
ambiguous ruling in 2013 that sent the case back to the lower court,
stating only that the university must show that it cannot achieve
diversity through other, non-racial means. In July 2014, <font color="#6b8e23">the
US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals </font>ruled that U of T follows a
&quot;holistic&quot; approach to applying affirmative action and can
continue the practice. On February 10, 2015, Fisher's lawyers filed a
new lawsuit in the Supreme Court. This is a renewed appeal that the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit erred - both the second
time and the first time. In June 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to
hear the case a second time. The case is likely to be decided <font color="#a0522d">in

Harvard allegedly rejected Asian-American applicants with

North End, but it was not broadcast in full. The following season's
final between Preston and Huddersfield was broadcast in full on the
BBC. When ITV was established in 1955, it shared the final with the
BBC and was one of the only club matches to be shown live on
television. In the 1970s and 1980s, the coverage became increasingly
detailed, and the BBC and ITV tried to steal viewers from each other
by starting earlier and earlier, some as early as <font color="#191970">9.00am</font>,
six hours before kick-off. Today this continues, with Setanta and
ESPN broadcasting all day from Wembley, but terrestrial coverage
usually starts <font color="#8b0000">two hours </font>before

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">With the decline of the Roman
Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Low Countries.
The Alemanni were a farming people, and their Germanic language
formed the basis of the dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine today
(<font color="#a9a9a9">Alsatian, Alemannic, Swiss, Swiss</font>). The
Alemanni were defeated by the Clovis and <font color="#dcdcdc">Franks
in the </font><font color="#2f4f4f">5th century AD, </font>culminating
in the Battle of Tolbian, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of
Austrasia. Under the <font color="#6b8e23">Merovingian </font>successors
of <font color="#556b2f">Clovis, the </font>inhabitants were
Christianised. Alsace remained under Frankish rule until the Frankish
kingdom <font color="#a0522d">was formally dissolved after the 842
Oath of Strasbourg in 843 </font>by the Treaty of Verdun; the
grandsons of Charlemagne divided the kingdom into three parts. Alsace
formed part of Central Francia, ruled by the youngest grandson,
Lothar I. Lothar died early in <font color="#228b22">855</font>, and
his kingdom was divided into three parts. The part known as
Lotharingia or Lorraine was given to Lothar's son. The remainder was
divided between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West
Frankish kingdom) and Louis the Saxon (ruler of the East Frankish
kingdom). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, as it
became, after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880, the Variscan Duchy of
Lorraine in East Francia. Alsace was merged with the other Low
Countries east of the Rhine to form the ancestral duchy of Swabia.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Around the same time, in the
surrounding areas, there were repeated <font color="#a9a9a9">dissolutions
and reorganisations between various secular and ecclesiastical feudal
principalities, a </font>common process in the Holy Roman Empire<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Alsace experienced great prosperity in the 1200s and 1300s
<font color="#556b2f">under the </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Hohenstaufen
</font><font color="#556b2f">emperors</font>. Frederick I established
Alsace as a province (procuratio, not provincia), ruled by
<font color="#6b8e23">ministeriales</font>, non-noble officials. The
idea was that such men would be easier to deal with and less likely
to alienate the fief from the crown through their own greed. The
province had one provincial court (<font color="#a0522d">Landgericht)
</font>and a central administration, based in Hagenau. Frederick II
appointed <font color="#228b22">a bishop of Strasbourg </font>to
administer Alsace, but the Habsburg Count Rudolf, who had received
his rights from Frederick II's son Conrad IV, challenged the bishop's
authority. Strasbourg began to grow into the most populous and
commercially important city in the region. In 1262, after a long
struggle with the ruling bishops, its inhabitants were granted the
status of a free imperial city. Strasbourg became the political and
economic centre of the region, being a stopping point on <font color="#191970">the
trade route between Paris, Vienna and Orient, and a </font>port on
the Rhine route linking southern Germany and Switzerland with the
Netherlands, England and Scandinavia. Cities such as <font color="#8b0000">Colmar
and Hagenau </font>also began to grow in economic importance, and
were granted a form of autonomy in the &quot;Decapolis&quot; or
&quot;Decapolis&quot;, which consisted of ten free cities.</p>

the Rhône and Meuse rivers, </font>and once these frontiers had been

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This situation prevailed until <font color="#a9a9a9">1639</font>,
when France conquered most of Alsace to keep it out of the hands of
the Spanish Habsburgs, who wanted a free road to their valuable and
rebellious possessions in the Spanish Netherlands. Beset by their
enemies and in order to gain a free hand in Hungary, the Habsburgs
sold their Sundgau territory (mostly in Upper Alsace) in <font color="#dcdcdc">1646
</font>to France, which had occupied it, <font color="#2f4f4f">for
1.2 million thalers. </font>When hostilities ended in 1648 <font color="#556b2f">with
the Peace of Westphalia</font>, most of Alsace was recognised as part
of France, although some towns remained independent. The treaty
provisions for Alsace were complex; although the King of France was
granted sovereignty, the rights and customs of the inhabitants were
largely retained. France maintained the customs frontier along the
Vosges mountains where it had been, and Alsace's economic orientation
towards its German-speaking neighbours was even stronger. German
continued to be used in local government, schools and the (Lutheran)
University of Strasbourg, which continued to receive students from
other German-speaking countries. The Edict of Fontainebleau of<font color="#6b8e23">
1685</font>, by which the King of France ordered <font color="#a0522d">the
suppression of French Protestantism, was </font>not applied in
Alsace. However, France did make efforts to promote Catholicism; for
example, Strasbourg Cathedral, which had been Lutheran from 1524 to
1681, was returned to the Catholic Church. Compared with the rest of
France, however, Alsace was characterised by a climate of religious
tolerance.</p>

played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, on

which were trying to crush the budding revolutionary republic. Many
Sundgau residents made 'pilgrimages', for example to <font color="#2f4f4f">the

The </font>combination of economic and demographic factors led to
<font color="#2f4f4f">hunger, housing shortages and a lack of jobs
for young people</font>. It is therefore not surprising that people
left Alsace not only for Paris - where the Alsace community was
growing in numbers and included famous members such as <font color="#556b2f">Baron
Haussmann </font>- but also further afield, such as Russia and the
Austrian Empire, to take advantage of new opportunities there:
Austria had conquered Eastern European countries from the Ottoman
Empire and offered generous conditions to the emigrants as a means of
consolidating its grip on new territories. Many Alsatians also began
to sail to the United States and settled in many areas between <font color="#6b8e23">1820
and 1850</font>. In 1843 and 1844, sailing ships arrived in New York
harbour with Alsace immigrant families. Some settled in Illinois,
many to farm or seek success in commercial enterprises: for example,
the sailing ships <font color="#a0522d">Sully </font>(May 1843) and
Iowa (June 1844) brought families to settle in northern Illinois and
northern Indiana. Some Alsace immigrants played a significant role <font color="#228b22">in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By 1790, the Jewish population of
Alsace was around <font color="#a9a9a9">22 500</font>, or about <font color="#dcdcdc">3%
</font>of the population of the province. They were very segregated
and subject to long-standing anti-Semitic regulations. They retained
their customs, Yiddish language and historical traditions in their
close-knit ghettos; they followed the Talmudic law enforced by their
rabbis. Jews were forbidden to enter most cities and instead lived in
<font color="#2f4f4f">villages</font>. They concentrated on <font color="#556b2f">trade,
services and especially money lending.</font> They financed about a
third of the mortgages in Alsace. Official tolerance increased during
the French Revolution, and in 1791 the Jews <font color="#6b8e23">were
completely emancipated</font>. However, local anti-Semitism also
increased, and <font color="#a0522d">Napoleon </font>turned hostile
in 1806 by imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews.
In the 1830s and 1870s, most Jews moved to the cities, where they
integrated and acculturated as anti-Semitism declined sharply. By
1831 the state began to pay salaries to official rabbis, and in 1846
the special statutory oath for Jews was abolished. Local anti-Semitic
riots occurred occasionally, especially during the 1848 revolution.
The incorporation of Alsace <font color="#228b22">into Germany

Empire, many of whom settled in French Algeria as Pieds-Noirs. It was

it was replaced in 1949 by a new &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Union

not recognised the flag of Rot-un-Wiss. Some enthusiastic statesmen
have called it a Nazi invention, although its origins date back to
the 11th century and the red and white flag of <font color="#191970">Gérard
de Lorraine </font>(also known as d'Alsace). Still considered by the

other spellings and names) is a Christian holiday that precedes the
Christian Lent. The main events usually take place <font color="#dcdcdc">in
February </font>or early March, when Carnival is historically known
as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnivals usually involve a <font color="#2f4f4f">public
</font>party and/or parade, combining elements of circus, masks and
public street parties. People wear masks and costumes at many
parties, which allow them to lose their everyday individuality and
experience a strong sense of <font color="#556b2f">social unity.
</font>Excessive consumption of <font color="#6b8e23">alcohol</font>,
meat and other foods forbidden during Lent is very common. Other
common features of carnivals include mock battles such as food
fights, social satire and mockery of authorities, grotesque bodies
with exaggerated features, especially large noses, stomachs, mouths
and phalluses or animal parts, offensive language and degrading acts,
depictions of illness and joyful death, and a general subversion of
everyday rules and norms.

Christian festivals, such as <font color="#556b2f">Christmas</font>,

Church has found it easier to turn the pagan carnival into a Catholic
tradition than to abolish it.  Unlike today, in the Middle Ages
Carnival did not last only a few days, but covered almost the entire

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although medieval feasts and
festivals, such as Corpus Christi, were sanctioned by the church,
carnival was also an expression of medieval popular culture. Many
local carnival customs are said to derive from local pre-Christian
rituals, such as the elaborate rituals of the Swedish-Alemannic
Fastnacht, involving masked figures. However, there is insufficient
<font color="#a9a9a9">evidence </font>to show a direct origin from
Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete descriptions of
<font color="#dcdcdc">Saturnalia </font>have survived, and the common
features of celebration, role reversal, temporary social equality,
masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily form a single
festival or unite these festivities. These similarities may represent
a reservoir of cultural resources that can contain multiple meanings
and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of
Jesus, followed by a liminal period, and ends with the rebirth.
Carnival reverses this with the resurrection of King Carnival,
followed by a liminal period before his death. Both celebrations are
counted according to the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival
can be seen as atoning figures who<font color="#2f4f4f">, by their
deaths, </font>make a gift to the people. For Jesus, the gift is
eternal life in heaven, and for King Carnival it is the <font color="#556b2f">recognition
that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life.</font> In
addition to Christian anti-Semitism, the similarities between the
rituals and images of the Church and Carnival suggest a common root.
The suffering of Christ is itself grotesque: since early
Christianity, Christ has been depicted as a victim of summary
judgment, tortured and executed by the Romans in front of a crowd of
Jews (&quot;His blood is our blood and the blood of our children!&quot;
Matthew 27:24-25). In Spanish Holy Week processions, crowds of people
loudly insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation
and laughter at the tragicomic image of God can be seen as an
intensification of the holy order. In 1466, the Catholic Church,
under the leadership of Pope Paul II, reintroduced the customs of the
Saturnalia carnival: <font color="#6b8e23">Jews </font>were forced to
run naked in a race through the streets of Rome. &quot;Before the
race, the Jews were fed liberally to make the race more difficult for
them and at the same time more fun for the spectators. They ran...
amidst the mocking shouts and shrieks of laughter in Rome, while the
Holy Father stood on a richly decorated balcony and laughed
heartily,&quot; says an eyewitness.</p>

New France </font>in North America. From Spain and Portugal, it
spread to the Caribbean and Latin America with colonialism. In the
German Rhineland and southern Holland in the early 19th century, a
weakened medieval tradition was also revived. Continuously in the
1700s and 1800s AD, as part of the annual Saturnalia celebrations of
the Roman carnival, carnival abuses forced ghetto rabbis to march
through the city streets <font color="#556b2f">in silly costumes, and
they were </font>mocked and thrown from the crowd with various
missiles. An appeal by the Jewish community in Rome in 1836 to <font color="#6b8e23">Pope
Gregory XVI </font>to stop the annual anti-Semitic abuse of
Saturnalia was met with a negative response: &quot;It is not
appropriate to make any reforms.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the <font color="#a9a9a9">Slovenian
</font>countryside there are various masked groups and individual
figures, the most popular and typical of which is the kurentti
(plural: kurenti), a monstrous and demon-like, but <font color="#dcdcdc">fluffy
</font>figure<font color="#a9a9a9">. The </font>most important
festival takes place in <font color="#2f4f4f">Ptuj </font>(see
Kurentovanje). Its main feature is the <font color="#556b2f">kurents
</font>themselves, magical beings from another world who visit major
events across the country to try to banish <font color="#6b8e23">winter
</font>and herald the arrival of spring, fertility and new life
through noise and dance. The origin of the Kurents is a mystery, and
little is known about the times, beliefs or purposes of their first
appearance. The origin of the name itself is obscure.</p>

Vilanova i la Geltrún </font>carnival has been documented since
1790, and is one of the richest carnivals because of the variety of
performances and rituals. The carnival follows the old style, where
satire, grotesque bodies (especially cross-dressing and the display
of exaggerated bellies, noses and phalluses) and, above all, active
participation are more important than the glamorous, media-friendly
spectacles that the Vilanovs deride <font color="#dcdcdc">as 'thighs
and feathers'. </font>It is best known for Sunday's <font color="#2f4f4f">Les
Comparses</font>, where at least 12 000 dancers, organised into
competing groups, throw 75 tonnes of hard candy at each other. Women
protect their faces with Mantons de Manila (Manila scarves), but eye
patches and broken hands are common the following week. The
Vilanovians organise l'Arrivo for the arrival of the Royal Carnival,
which changes every year. It includes a boisterous procession of
floats and dancers mocking <font color="#556b2f">current events or
public figures, and a </font>bitingly satirical sermon (el sermo)
delivered by the king himself. On Dijous Gras day, Vilanov children
are released from school to take part in the <font color="#6b8e23">Merengada</font>,

The arrangements are designed to make it easy for a woman to
establish a temporary relationship with a man in complete anonymity.
Unmasked women are not welcome. According to tradition, if such a
woman gets up to dance, the orchestra stops playing. Alcohol is
served in bars - masked women whisper &quot;touloulou thirsty&quot;

characteristics that continued to this day. The Prado government
first banned it from the streets in 1958 and then completely in 1959.
It consisted mainly of water fights in the traditional
manner,[clarification needed] while in later years it also included
playing with dirty water, mud, oil and dyes - and also included
fights and sometimes looting of private property and <font color="#556b2f">sexual
assaults on women.</font> It has become an excuse for criminal gangs

growth of Baptists in both New England and the South. The Second
Great Awakening in the early 1800s in the South increased church
membership, as did the fact that preachers reduced their support for
the abolition of slavery and manumission, which had been part of the
teachings of the 1700s. Baptist missionaries have spread their church

</font>he became a 'Puritan, an English Separatist and then a Baptist
Separatist', and ended his days working with Mennonites. He began
meeting with 60-70 English separatists in England at a time of 'great
danger'. The persecution of religious non-conformists in England led
Smyth to go into exile <font color="#a0522d">in Amsterdam </font>with
other fellow separatists from a congregation he had gathered in
Lincolnshire, separate from the established church (Anglican). Smyth
and his lay supporter Thomas Helwys and the people they led separated
from the other English exiles because Smyth and Helwys were convinced
that they should be baptised as believers. In <font color="#228b22">1609,

</font>wrote a treatise <font color="#dcdcdc">entitled &quot;The

His conviction was therefore that the biblical church should consist

basis of a personal confession of faith. </font>He rejected the
Separatist doctrine of <font color="#a0522d">infant baptism

Smyth left the group, and the layman Thomas Helwys took over the
leadership and led the church back to England in <font color="#191970">1611</font>.
Eventually Smyth committed himself to believer's baptism as the only
biblical baptism. He was convinced, based on his interpretation of
the Bible, that infants would not be damned if they died in infancy.</p>

churches, associations and missionary organisations, especially in
the northern states. Blacks established some independent
congregations in the South before the American Civil War, and after
the war <font color="#dcdcdc">those who were freed </font>quickly
separated from white churches and associations. They wanted to be
free from white control. In 1866, the Consolidated American Baptist
Convention, formed by black Baptists from the South and West, helped
southern associations to establish black state conventions, and this
was done in <font color="#2f4f4f">Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North
Carolina and Kentucky.</font> In 1880, the black state conventions
merged into a national foreign missionary convention to support black
Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were
formed, and in 1895 they merged into the National Baptist Convention,
an organisation that later underwent its own changes and other
conventions broke away. It is the largest black religious
organisation and the second largest Baptist organisation in the
world. Baptists are the most numerically dominant in the Southeast. A

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the second half of the 19th
century, the <font color="#a9a9a9">use of child labour began to
decline in </font>industrialised societies due to regulatory and
economic factors. The regulation of child labour began in the early
stages of the industrial revolution. The first law regulating child
labour was passed in Britain in <font color="#dcdcdc">1803.</font> As
early as 1802 and 1819, the Factory Acts were passed, regulating the
working hours of working children in factories and cotton mills to 12
hours a day. These laws were largely ineffective, and after radical
agitation by groups such as the Short Time Committees in 1831, the
Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11-18 should
work no more than 12 hours a day, children aged 9-11 no more than 8
hours, and that <font color="#2f4f4f">children under 9 </font>should
no longer be allowed to work. However, this law only applied to the
textile industry, and further agitation led to a second law in <font color="#556b2f">1847
</font>limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days.

estimates that there were 153 million child labourers aged 5-14
worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than the ILO
estimate of child labourers in 2004. Around 60% of child labour was
involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy farming,
fishing and forestry. Another 25 per cent of child labourers worked
in service activities such as retail trade, merchandising,
restaurants, loading and moving goods, warehousing, garbage
collection and recycling, shoe shining, domestic work and other
services. The remaining 15% worked in assembly and manufacturing jobs
in the informal economy, home-based businesses, factories, mines,
packing salt, operating machinery and other similar jobs. <font color="#dcdcdc">Two

labour was common in the colonies of the European </font>superpowers
between 1650 and 1950. In Africa, the colonial administration
encouraged traditional family-based production methods, i.e.
employing the household rather than just adults to work. <font color="#dcdcdc">Millions
of </font>children worked on colonial agricultural plantations, in
mines and in domestic service industries<font color="#dcdcdc">. </font>In
these colonies, sophisticated systems were developed whereby children

<font color="#556b2f">without pay </font>in exchange for learning a
craft. The Pauper Apprenticeship system was introduced in the 19th
century, when a colonial master did not need the consent of the
native parents or the child to allow the child to work for his
parents on a distant farm owned by another colonial master. Other
schemes included 'earn and learn' programmes, where children worked
and thus learned. For example, in 1899 Britain passed the Masters and
Servants Act, followed by the Tax and Pass Law, which promoted child
labour in the colonies, particularly in Africa. These laws provided
indigenous people with legal title to a portion of indigenous land in
exchange for the labour of their wives and children for colonial
administration, for example on farms and as picannins.</p>

Together with the United Nations Human Rights Committee, these two
declarations work at many levels to eliminate child labour. Although
many measures have been taken to end this epidemic, child labour <font color="#a9a9a9">in
Africa </font>remains a problem because of the <font color="#dcdcdc">unclear

children have to engage in activities that are crucial to their

dangerous and hazardous working conditions. This led to the minimum
age being raised again to 14. In 1998, a second restriction was
adopted, limiting the types of work allowed for young people, such as
work considered hazardous, such as the use of construction machinery,
or certain types of factory work. Although many measures have been

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many factors, such as the industrial
revolution of the late 17th century and the significant presence of
child labour during the industrial period, played a role in Britain's
long-term economic growth. Children who worked at an early age were
often not forced to do so, but did so because they needed to help
their families survive economically. As employment opportunities <font color="#a9a9a9">were
poor </font>for many parents, sending children to work on farms and
in factories was a way of <font color="#dcdcdc">helping to feed and
support the family.</font> The use of child labour began in England
when household enterprises were turned into local labour markets,
where previously home-made products were mass-produced. Since
children often helped produce goods in their homes, working in
factories to make the same goods was an easy change for many of these
young people. Although there are several figures for children under
the age of ten working in factories, the majority of child workers
were <font color="#2f4f4f">between the ages of ten and fourteen. </font>This
age was an important time for many young people, as <font color="#556b2f">they
were first helping to support their families, while also moving into

of the population was made up of children aged between 5 and 14. This
significant change in the size of the workforce and the development
of the industrial revolution meant that children began to work in
businesses outside the home at an earlier stage in their lives. While

Piedmont ranges in elevation from about 91-122 m (300-400 <font color="#6b8e23">ft</font>)
in the east to over 300 m (300 ft) in the west. Due to Piedmont's
rapid population growth, much of the rural areas of this region are
becoming suburbs with shopping malls, housing and business offices.
Agriculture is becoming less and less important. Piedmont's major
rivers, such as the Yadkin and Catawba, are generally fast-flowing,

renamed Cuenca. His expedition built the fort at San Juan and left a
detachment of 30 men there, while Pardo travelled further afield and
built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different
route to Santa Elena on Parris Island in South Carolina, then the
centre of Spanish Florida. In the spring of 1568, the natives killed
all but one of the soldiers and burned six forts inland, including
Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior,
this attempt marked the first European attempt to colonise the
interior in what became the United States. A diary written in the

1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.</p>

group of nobles known as the Lords Proprietors, who had helped
restore Charles to the throne in 1660. The new province of &quot;Carolina&quot;
was named in honour and memory of King Charles I (Latin: Carolus). In

Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white
women and enslaved or free African or African-American men. Because
the mothers were free, their children were born free. Many of them
had emigrated or were descendants of colonial Virginia immigrants. As
the flow of forced labourers to the colony diminished as economic
conditions in Britain improved, plantation farmers brought in more
<font color="#6b8e23">slaves, and the </font>state's legal

February <font color="#dcdcdc">1781, </font>Cornwallis encountered
resistance on the banks of the Catawba River as he tried to catch
General Morgan's troops during a tactical retreat. Morgan had moved
to the northern part of the state to join forces with General
Greene's newly recruited troops. Generals Greene and Cornwallis
finally met at the Battle of Guilford Court House in present-day
<font color="#2f4f4f">Greensboro on </font>15 March 1781. Although
the British held the field at the end of the battle, their losses
against the numerically superior Continental army were crippling.
After this 'Pyrrhic victory', Cornwallis decided to move to <font color="#556b2f">the

</font>and allow the Royal Navy to protect his battered army. This

have undergone several significant changes in recent years: in the
2010 midterm elections, Tar Heel voters elected a Republican-majority
bicameral legislature for the first time in more than a century, but
North Carolina has also become the southern state to swing
presidential races. After Southerner Democrat Jimmy Carter won the
state comfortably in <font color="#a9a9a9">1976</font>, the state was
consistently Republican in presidential elections until Democrat
Barack Obama narrowly won the state in <font color="#dcdcdc">2008</font>.
In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton was just one point away from
winning the state in <font color="#2f4f4f">1992 </font>and narrowly
lost it in <font color="#556b2f">1996</font>. Bush easily won the
state by more than 12 points, but by 2008 demographic changes,
population growth and increased liberalisation in densely populated
areas such as the Research Triangle, Charlotte, Greensboro,
Winston-Salem, Fayetteville and Asheville propelled Barack Obama to
victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since
1976. In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive
state, and Democrats even held the 2012 Democratic National
Convention <font color="#6b8e23">in Charlotte</font>. However,
Republican Mitt Romney eventually won North Carolina by 2 points, the
only state Obama lost in 2012, and one of only two states (along with
Indiana) that switched from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.</p>

from 794 to 1185. The period is named after <font color="#556b2f">Heian-kyō</font>,
the capital of present-day Kyōto. It is the period in Japanese
history when <font color="#6b8e23">Buddhism, Taoism </font>and other

considered the height of the Japanese imperial court and is known <font color="#a0522d">for

the surface, the real power lay with the <font color="#191970">Fujiwara

the Imperial family. The mothers of many of the emperors were in fact

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When Emperor Kammu moved the capital
to Heian-kyō (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the
next <font color="#a9a9a9">thousand years</font>, he did so <font color="#dcdcdc">not
only to strengthen imperial power but also to improve the
geopolitical position of his seat of power</font>. Nara was abandoned
after only <font color="#2f4f4f">70 years, </font>partly <font color="#556b2f">because

accessible by <font color="#a0522d">land from the eastern provinces</font>.
The beginning of the Heian period (<font color="#228b22">784-967)
</font>continued the Nara culture; the capital of Heian was modelled
on the Chinese <font color="#191970">Tang </font>capital Chang'an,
like Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara. Kammu sought to improve
the existing Tang-style administrative system. This system, known <font color="#8b0000">as
ritsuryō, </font>sought to re-establish the Tang Empire in Japan,
even though there were 'huge differences in development' between the
countries. Despite the decline of Taika-Taihō reforms, imperial rule
was strong in the early Heian period. Indeed, Kammu's avoidance of
drastic reforms reduced the intensity of political struggles, and he
was recognised as one of Japan's most powerful emperors.</p>

developed using parts of <font color="#2f4f4f">Chinese characters</font>,
was abbreviated to <font color="#556b2f">hiragana</font>, an italic

much of which was written by courtiers who had not been educated in

of clan system had remained largely intact within the grand old

that new institutions were now needed. <font color="#556b2f">The

</font>now became public institutions. The <font color="#a0522d">Fujiwaras
</font>ruled Japan as the most powerful family and decided on the
general affairs of the state, such as the succession to the throne.
Family and state affairs became thoroughly intertwined, and this
pattern was followed by other families, monasteries and even the
imperial family. The <font color="#228b22">administration of the
country </font>became the aristocracy's primary livelihood, not so
much because direct control by the <font color="#191970">imperial
family </font>or the central government had declined, but rather
because of strong family solidarity and the fact that Japan was no

to spread throughout <font color="#dcdcdc">Japan </font>during the
Heian period, mainly through two major esoteric sects, <font color="#2f4f4f">Tendai
and Shingon</font><font color="#556b2f">.</font> Tendai originated in
China and is based on the Lotus Sutra, one of the most important
sutras of Mahayana Buddhism; Saichō was instrumental in bringing it
to Japan. Shingon is a Japanese transmission of the Chen Yen school
of Chinese. Shingon, brought to Japan by the monk <font color="#6b8e23">Kūkai,
</font>emphasises esoteric Buddhism. Both Kūkai and Saichō sought
to combine state and religion and to gain support from the
aristocracy, leading to the concept of 'aristocratic Buddhism'. An
important part of the Tendai doctrine was the proposition that
enlightenment was attainable by &quot;<font color="#a0522d">every
being</font>&quot;. <font color="#228b22">Saichō </font>also sought
independent ordination for Tendai monks. A close relationship
developed between the Tendai monastic complex on Mount Hiei and the
<font color="#191970">imperial court in </font>its new capital at the
foot of the mountain. As a result, great respect for the emperor and
the nation was emphasised in Tendai. Kammu himself was a major patron
of the Tendai clan, which rose to great power in the following
centuries. Kūkai made a great impression on the emperors who
succeeded Emperor Kammu, and also on generations of Japanese, not
only through his holiness but also through his poetry, calligraphy,
painting and sculpture. With its &quot;rich symbols, rituals and
mandalas&quot;, the Shingon had a wide appeal.</p>

expected to master the art of writing <font color="#dcdcdc">poetry </font>as
a sign of their status. Any occasion could require the writing of a
poem, from the birth of a child to the coronation of an emperor or
even a beautiful nature scene. A well-written poem or haiku could
easily make or break a person's reputation, and was often a key
element of social interaction.Almost as important was the choice of
calligraphy, or handwriting. The Japanese of this period believed
that <font color="#2f4f4f">handwriting </font>could reflect the <font color="#556b2f">state

<font color="#6b8e23">poor or hasty handwriting </font>could be taken
as a sign of poor breeding. Regardless of whether the script was
Chinese or Japanese, good handwriting and artistic skill were
paramount to social reputation when it came to poetry. Sei Shonagon
mentions in his Pillow Book that when a courtesan tried to ask him
for advice on how to write a poem <font color="#a0522d">for </font>Empress

was a perplexing problem. <font color="#2f4f4f">Carl Linnaeus's

species to be fixed by divine design. In 1766, Georges Buffon

lions, tigers and leopards, might be descended from a common
ancestor. Ussher's 1650s chronology had put the time of creation at

called <font color="#556b2f">Lamarckism</font>. Lamarck thought that
there was an inherent progressive tendency that drove organisms
steadily towards greater complexity as parallel but distinct lineages

environment influenced the embryos, and that the structures of
animals were determined by a fixed plan, as shown by homologues.

formed only in isolated populations, such as islands, to an emphasis
on speciation without isolation; in other words, he saw increasing
specialisation within large stable populations as constantly
exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research
focusing on the difficulties associated with his theory. He studied

</font>Darwin had a theory of basic natural selection &quot;with
which to work&quot;, but nearly twenty years later, when Wallace's
letter arrived on 18 June 1858, Darwin was still not ready to publish
his theory. It was long thought that Darwin avoided or delayed
publishing his ideas for personal reasons. Reasons have been
suggested, including <font color="#dcdcdc">fear of religious
persecution or social disgrace </font>if his views were revealed, and
concern that he would not upset <font color="#2f4f4f">his clerical
naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma.</font> Charles Darwin's
illness caused repeated delays. His article on <font color="#556b2f">Glen
Roy </font>had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to

during Darwin's lifetime, but there were problems translating the
concepts and metaphors, and some translations had their own agenda.
Darwin distributed demonstration copies in France and Germany in the
hope that suitable applicants would come forward, as the translators
themselves were expected to make arrangements with the local
publisher. He welcomed the distinguished senior naturalist and
geologist <font color="#a9a9a9">Heinrich Georg Bronn, </font>but the
<font color="#dcdcdc">German translation, published in 1860,
incorporated Bronn's own ideas and added controversial topics that
Darwin had deliberately omitted. </font>Bronn translated the words
'favoured races' <font color="#2f4f4f">as 'perfected races' </font>and
added inscriptions on the origin of life and the religious
implications of the last chapter, which were partly inspired by
Bronn's Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition
based on the third English edition and the additions suggested by
Darwin, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely
with <font color="#556b2f">Julius Victor Carus</font>, who published
an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a
translator in France failed, and Clémence Royer's translation,
published in 1862, included an introduction praising Darwin's ideas
as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas
anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as <font color="#6b8e23">numerous
explanatory notes in which he provided his own answers to Darwin's
doubts.</font> Darwin corresponded with Royer on the second edition
published in 1866 and the third edition published in 1870, but Darwin
had difficulty in persuading Royer to remove his remarks, and these
editions caused him problems. He was unhappy until Edmond Barbier's
translation was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius
Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional editions
had appeared in Italian and Russian. During Darwin's lifetime, Origin
was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873,

short legs), and (2) ubiquitous minor differences (example: pigeons
with slightly shorter or longer beaks). Breeders can take advantage

Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex </font>(1871).
Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in the formation
of new species, but given the efficiency of artificial selection, he
'saw <font color="#2f4f4f">no limit to the amount of change, to the

version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after
Darwin's death came to be called <font color="#dcdcdc">Lamarckism</font>),

no doubt that <font color="#2f4f4f">in our domestic animals use
strengthens and enlarges certain parts and disuse diminishes them</font>,
and that such changes are inherited&quot;, and that this is also true
in nature. Darwin noted that some of the changes that generally
result from use and disuse, such as the loss of wings in some island
insects, may be due to natural selection. In later editions of
Origin, Darwin expanded the importance of the inheritance of acquired
characteristics. Darwin also acknowledged his ignorance of the source
of heritable changes, but speculated that they might be due <font color="#556b2f">to
environmental factors. </font>One thing was clear, however: whatever
the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from
observation and experimentation that <font color="#6b8e23">breeders

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Chapter IX discusses the fact that
the geological record seems to show that life forms appeared
suddenly, without the myriad transitional fossils that are expected
to emerge as a result of gradual changes. Darwin cited <font color="#a9a9a9">Charles
</font>Lyell's argument in<font color="#dcdcdc"> Principles of
Geology that the </font>record is extremely imperfect because
fossilisation is a very rare event spread over large periods of time;
because few areas had been geologically explored, only fragmentary
information on geological formations could be obtained, and fossil
collections were very incomplete. Evolved local species that have
migrated over a wider area appear to be the sudden appearance of a
new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct
evolutionary history, but the continuing discoveries gave him
reasonable hope <font color="#2f4f4f">that new discoveries would
occasionally reveal transitional patterns</font>. To show that
natural selection had been slow, he again referred to Principles of
Geology and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion,
such as the estimate that the erosion of the Weald had lasted <font color="#556b2f">300
million years</font>. The presence of entire groups of highly evolved
organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing strata, now known <font color="#6b8e23">as
the Cambrian explosion, </font>posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt
that the earlier seas had been filled with living things, but he
found he had no satisfactory explanation for the absence of fossils.
Since then, fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has been discovered,
extending the history of life back billions of years.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Chapter X examines whether the
fossil record models are better explained by common descent and
branching evolution by natural selection than by the individual
creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change <font color="#a9a9a9">slowly,
but not as rapidly </font>- some organisms, such as Lingula, were
unchanging from the earliest fossils. The rate of natural selection
would depend on <font color="#dcdcdc">environmental variability and
change.</font> This distinguished his theory from Lamarck's Laws of
Inevitable Progress. It has been argued that this anticipates the
punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other researchers have
preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He referred
to <font color="#2f4f4f">Richard </font>Owen's observations that the
earliest members of the class were a few simple and generalised
species with characteristics intermediate between the present forms,
followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms corresponding
to the branching of common descent from the ancestor. The extinction
of endangered species was consistent with his theory, as related
species groups continued to exist until extinction, after which they
ceased to exist. <font color="#556b2f">Recently extinct species
resembled living species more than species from earlier periods, </font>and
as he had seen in South America and William Clift in Australia,
fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living

from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in
flora and fauna between regions cannot be explained by environmental
differences alone; <font color="#a9a9a9">South America, Africa and
Australia have similar climatic regions at the same latitudes, but
these regions have very different plants and animals</font>. Species
found in one region of a continent are more closely related to
species found in other regions of the same continent than to species
found on other continents. Darwin found that <font color="#dcdcdc">migration
barriers played an important role in the differences between species
in different regions.</font> The Atlantic and Pacific coastal waters
of Central America had almost no species in common, even though the
Panama Isthmus was only a few kilometres wide. <font color="#2f4f4f">His
explanation was a combination of migration and ancestry with
modification.</font> He went on to say, &quot;From this principle of
heredity and variation we can understand how it is possible that
parts of genera, whole families and even genera are confined to the
same regions, as is so generally and notoriously the case.&quot;
Darwin explained how a volcanic island a few hundred miles from a
continent could be colonised by a few species from that continent.
These species would change over time, but would still be related to
the species on the mainland, and Darwin found that this was a common
pattern. Darwin discussed ways in which species could spread across
oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had studied
experimentally.</p>

convoluted sentences, while in other places his writing was

it was more accessible than the great book on natural selection that
Darwin had worked on, which <font color="#6b8e23">would have been

evolution by natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875
most scientists accepted that evolution occurred, but few considered
natural selection to be significant. Darwin's scientific method was
also disputed, with his supporters favouring the empiricism of John
Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to <font color="#2f4f4f">the

Huxley</font>. Nevertheless, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on
evolution; however, he insisted on experiments to show whether
natural selection could produce new species and questioned whether
Darwin's gradualism without sudden leaps was sufficient to cause
speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular without religious

'extending the dominion of science into regions of thought where it

Huxley became influential and founded the X Club, which used the
magazine Nature to promote evolution and naturalism and shaped much

anatomist <font color="#a9a9a9">Richard Owen, </font>an idealist who
had moved in the 1850s to the view that the history of life was the
gradual realisation of a divine plan. Owen's review of Origin,
published in the Edinburgh Review in April 1860, <font color="#dcdcdc">bitterly
attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also accepted a form of
evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous 'destined coming' </font>in
which new species would arise through natural generation. Among those
who rejected natural selection but supported 'birth by birth' was the
Duke of Argyll, who explained the beauty of feather coverings by
design. Since 1858, <font color="#2f4f4f">Huxley had stressed the
anatomical similarities between apes and humans, and challenged
Owen's view that man was a separate subclass. </font>Their

the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where <font color="#556b2f">the
legendary Oxford Debate on Evolution </font>took place <font color="#556b2f">in
1860</font>. In a heated public debate that lasted two years,
satirised by Charles Kingsley as the 'Great Hippocampus Question' and
parodied by Huxley in The Water-Babies as the 'great hippopotamus
test', Huxley showed that Owen was wrong to claim that the monkey
brain lacked a structure that is also found in the human brain.
Others, such as Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that
humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but that higher mental
faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process.

His original goal as General Secretary was to revive the Soviet
economy, and he realised that this would require a reform of
political and social structures. Reforms began by replacing the
leading officials of the Brezhnev era who would have blocked
political and economic change. On 23 April 1985, Gorbachev brought
two of his protégés, <font color="#6b8e23">Yegor Ligachev and
Nikolai Ryzhkov, into </font>the Politburo as full members. He kept
the 'power ministries' happy by promoting KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov
from candidate to full member and appointing Defence Minister Marshal
Sergei Sokolov as Politburo candidate.</p>

</font>Gorbachev gave a speech in Leningrad in which he advocated
reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to combat widespread alcoholism<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Prices of vodka, wine and beer were raised to make these
drinks more expensive and discourage consumers, and <font color="#dcdcdc">rationing
was introduced.</font> Unlike most forms of rationing, which seek to
conserve scarce commodities, this rationing restricted sales and
clearly aimed to curb binge drinking. Gorbachev's plan also included
billboards promoting sobriety, stiffer penalties for public
drunkenness and censorship of <font color="#2f4f4f">drinking scenes
in old films. </font>Although this programme was not a direct copy of
the outright prohibition implemented by <font color="#556b2f">Tsar
Nicholas II </font><font color="#6b8e23">during the First World War,
</font>Gorbachev faced the same negative economic reaction as the
previous Tsar. According to Alexander Yakovlev, alcohol prohibition
was a serious blow to the state budget, as he estimated that annual
collections from alcohol taxes were reduced by 100 billion roubles.
Alcohol production moved to the black market or through moonshining,
as some people made 'bathtub vodka' from home-grown potatoes. Poorer
and less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes
such as nail varnish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only
increased the burden on the Russian health care system due to
poisoning cases. However, these reforms were intended to reinforce
the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms which
were geared towards market socialism.</p>

Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan), the regional council voted to secede
and join the Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia. This local

Azerbaijanis near Stepanakert, <font color="#2f4f4f">two </font>soldiers
were killed and more than two dozen wounded. This led to near-ethnic
divisions in the two capitals of Nagorno-Karabakh: the Azerbaijani
minority was expelled from Stepanakert and the <font color="#556b2f">Armenian

Suren Harutyunyan as First Secretary of the Communist Party of
Armenia. However, Harutyunyan quickly decided to run ahead of the
nationalist wind and on 28 May allowed Armenians to unfurl the first
red, blue and gold flag of the Republic of Armenia for the first time
in almost 70 years. On 15 June 1988, the Armenian Supreme Council
adopted a resolution formally endorsing the idea of
Nagorno-Karabakh's accession to Armenia. Armenia, which had
previously been one of the most loyal republics, had suddenly become
the leading rebel republic. On 5 July 1988, when troops were sent to
forcibly remove demonstrators from Yerevan's Zvartnots International
Airport, shots were fired and <font color="#a9a9a9">one </font>student
demonstrator was killed. In September, further large demonstrations
in Yerevan led to the deployment of armoured vehicles. In the autumn

almost all of Armenia's 200,000 Azerbaijani minority, killing more

tribute to Mihai Eminescu in front of the bust of the Aleea
Clasicilor Park, proposed the continuation of the meetings. In the
public debate, the movement called for a national awakening, freedom
of expression, the revival of Moldovan traditions and the official
status of the <font color="#6b8e23">Romanian </font>language and a
return to the Latin alphabet. The transition from a 'movement'
(informal association) to a 'front' (official association) was seen

However, no one in Russia or in the Kremlin objected. Objections from

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At Calvary, Jesus was offered <font color="#a9a9a9">wine
mixed with bile to </font>drink. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark tell
us that he <font color="#dcdcdc">refused</font>. He was then
crucified and hanged between two condemned thieves. According to some
translations from the original Greek, the thieves may have been
robbers or Jewish rebels. According to the Gospel of Mark, he
suffered the agonies of crucifixion for about <font color="#2f4f4f">six
hours </font>from the third hour, about 9 o'clock in the morning,
until the ninth hour of his death, which corresponds to about 3
o'clock in the afternoon. The soldiers pinned a sign above his head
that read in three languages &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, King of the
Jews&quot;, divided his clothes and threw lots from his seamless
garment. The Roman soldiers did not cut off Jesus' legs, as they did
with the other two men who were crucified (cutting off the legs
speeded up the crucifixion), because Jesus was already dead. Each
Gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, <font color="#556b2f">seven
</font><font color="#6b8e23">sentences in all.</font> In the Synoptic
Gospels, the crucifixion is accompanied by various supernatural
events, such as darkness, an earthquake and (in Matthew's Gospel) the
resurrection of the saints. After Jesus' death, <font color="#a0522d">Joseph
of Arimathea </font>lifted his body from the cross and buried it <font color="#228b22">in

is the explanation given in <font color="#dcdcdc">all four Gospels

the name of the place where Jesus was crucified. It is not clear from
the text why it was so named, but several theories have been put

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The death and resurrection of Jesus
are the basis for many different theological interpretations of <font color="#a9a9a9">how
humanity is saved</font>. These interpretations vary greatly
according to the emphasis they place on Jesus' death as opposed to
his words. In the substitutionary atonement view, the death of Jesus
<font color="#dcdcdc">is </font><font color="#2f4f4f">central, </font>and
<font color="#556b2f">Jesus voluntarily sacrificed himself as a
</font><font color="#a0522d">perfect </font><font color="#6b8e23">act
of </font><font color="#a0522d">obedience as a </font>sacrifice of
love <font color="#228b22">pleasing to </font>God. In contrast, the
moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral
content of Jesus' teaching and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom.
Since <font color="#191970">the Middle Ages, there has been a
</font>conflict between these two views in Western Christianity.
Evangelical Protestants typically support the substitutionary view
and especially <font color="#8b0000">the penal substitution theory.</font>
Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and
subscribe to the moral agency theory of atonement. Both views are
popular in <font color="#483d8b">the Roman Catholic Church</font>,
and the doctrine of satisfaction is incorporated into the idea of
penance.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Israeli Supreme Court is the
head of the Israeli state court system. It is the highest court. The
seat of the Supreme Court is in <font color="#dcdcdc">Jerusalem.</font>
Its jurisdiction covers the entire country. The Supreme Court's
decision is binding on all courts except the Supreme Court itself.
The Israeli Supreme Court is <font color="#2f4f4f">both a court of
appeal and the highest court</font>. As an appellate court, the
Supreme Court hears appeals (<font color="#556b2f">both criminal and
civil) </font>against judgments and other decisions of district
courts. It also hears appeals against various judicial and
quasi-judicial decisions, such as cases concerning the legality of
Knesset elections and disciplinary decisions of the Bar Association.
As the Supreme Court (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le'Zedek <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">בית
משפט גבוה לצדק</span></font>; also known by its initials
Bagatz <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">בג </span></font>&quot;<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">ץ</span></font>),
the Supreme Court is the first instance court to rule mainly on the
legality of decisions by state authorities: Government decisions,
decisions of local authorities and other bodies and persons
performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to
the constitutionality of laws enacted by <font color="#6b8e23">the
Knesset</font>. The Court has broad discretion to decide cases in
which it deems it necessary to grant relief in the interests of
justice and which do not fall within the jurisdiction of another
court. <font color="#a0522d">For example, the </font>Supreme Court
grants <font color="#a0522d">relief through injunctions, mandamus and
writs of habeas corpus, and declaratory </font>judgments. The Supreme
Court may also sit in further proceedings on its own judgment. In a
case decided by the Supreme Court - either as an appellate court or
as the highest court - <font color="#228b22">by a panel of three or
more judges</font>, it may give its judgment in a further hearing
with a larger number of judges. A further hearing may be held if the
Supreme Court gives a decision which conflicts with a previous
decision or if the Court considers that the importance, difficulty or
novelty of the Court's decision justifies such a hearing. The Supreme
Court also has the unique power to order a <font color="#191970">&quot;trial

Shakespeare's works have been particularly fertile ground for textual
criticism - both <font color="#a9a9a9">because </font><font color="#dcdcdc">the
texts, as edited, contain considerable variation, </font><font color="#a9a9a9">and
because the </font>effort and expense of producing better editions of

principles of textual criticism were originally developed and refined
for the ancient works of the <font color="#556b2f">Bible </font>and
Shakespeare, they have also been applied to many other works, ranging
from the present day to the earliest known written documents <font color="#6b8e23">in

The age of the printing press made the profession of scribe virtually
obsolete. Although printed editions are less susceptible to the

are <font color="#556b2f">not immune to the introduction of
variations that differ from the author's handwriting</font>. Instead
of a scribe miscopying his source work, <font color="#6b8e23">a
compositor or printer may read or write the work in a way that
differs from the typescript</font>. Since each scribe or printer
makes different mistakes, <font color="#a0522d">reconstructing a lost

should have </font><font color="#556b2f">fewer errors. </font>Also,

stemmology or stemmatology is a <font color="#dcdcdc">rigorous
approach to textual criticism</font>. Karl Lachmann (<font color="#2f4f4f">1793-1851),
</font>although not the inventor of this method, had a major
influence on its popularisation. The method takes its name from the
word stemma. The ancient Greek word stemmata and its loanword in
classical Latin stemmata can refer to 'family tree'. This specific
meaning indicates the family relationship of the living witnesses
(the first known example of such a stemmata, albeit with a name,
dates from 1827). <font color="#556b2f">The family tree is also
referred to as a cladogram.</font> This method works on the principle
that 'the community of error implies the community of origin'. In
other words, if two witnesses have several errors in common, it <font color="#6b8e23">can
be assumed that they originate from a </font><font color="#a0522d">common
intermediate source</font>, called a hyparchetype. The relationships
between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process,
<font color="#228b22">whereby all existing manuscripts are placed in
a family tree descended from a single archetype, the </font><font color="#191970">stemma
codicum. The </font><font color="#8b0000">process of constructing the
stemma is </font>called <font color="#483d8b">recension, </font>from

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The critic Joseph Bédier
(1864-1938) launched a particularly scathing attack on stemmatics in
1928. He examined editions of medieval French texts produced by the
stemmatic method and found that <font color="#dcdcdc">textual critics
overwhelmingly tended to produce trees that split into only two
branches</font><font color="#2f4f4f">. </font>He concluded that this
result was unlikely to be due to chance and that <font color="#556b2f">the
method </font>thus <font color="#556b2f">tended to </font><font color="#6b8e23">produce
bipartite stems</font><font color="#556b2f">, regardless of the

tended to favour trees with two branches, </font>as <font color="#228b22">this
maximised the </font><font color="#191970">chances of editorial
discretion </font>(since there would be no third branch to &quot;<font color="#8b0000">break

out that for many works, more than one reasonable <font color="#483d8b">type

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Cladistics is
a </font>technique borrowed from biology, where Willi Hennig
originally called it <font color="#dcdcdc">phylogenetic systematics.
</font>In biology, the technique is used <font color="#2f4f4f">to
determine the evolutionary relationships between different species.</font>
In the application of textual criticism, the texts of several
different manuscripts are fed into a computer, which records all the
differences between them. The manuscripts<font color="#556b2f"> are
then grouped according to their common features. </font>Cladistics
differs from more traditional forms of statistical analysis in that,
rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groups based
on their general similarity, <font color="#6b8e23">cladistics assumes
that </font><font color="#a0522d">they are part of a branching family
tree, </font>and uses this assumption to infer relationships between
them. This makes it more of an automated approach to phylogeny.
However, the computer does not attempt to decide which reading method
is closer to the original text, and therefore <font color="#228b22">does
not tell which branch of the tree is the &quot;root&quot;</font>,
i.e. which manuscript tradition is closest to the original text.
Other types of evidence must be used for this purpose.</p>

studies had been done, it was not until the <font color="#a9a9a9">early
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">1970s </font>that real textual criticism
was applied to the Book of Mormon. At that time, <font color="#556b2f">the
LDS Church </font>asked <font color="#2f4f4f">BYU </font>professor
Ellis Rasmussen and his colleagues to begin work on a new edition of
the Holy Scriptures. One part of this work involved <font color="#6b8e23">digitizing
the text and creating appropriate footnotes</font>; another part
required determining the most reliable text. For the latter purpose,
Stanley R. Larson (a graduate student of Rasmussen) undertook a
thesis on the <font color="#a0522d">application of </font><font color="#228b22">modern
text-critical standards </font><font color="#a0522d">to the
manuscripts </font>and early editions of the Book of Mormon, which he
completed in <font color="#191970">1974.</font> To do this, Larson
carefully examined the Original Manuscript (dictated to his scribes
by Joseph Smith) and the Printer's Manuscript (a copy prepared for
the printer by Oliver Cowdery between 1829 and 1830) and compared
them with the first, second and third editions of the Book of Mormon
to determine what changes had occurred over time and to make
judgments about which reading styles were most original. <font color="#8b0000">Larson
</font>went on to publish a useful series of well-argued articles on

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In <font color="#a9a9a9">1877,
</font>Thomas Edison invented the phonograph<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Unlike the phonautograph, it could <font color="#dcdcdc">both
record and play back sound</font>. Despite the similarity of the
names, there are no documents to show that Edison's phonograph was
based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first experimented with
recording sound on waxed paper tape, and his idea was to create a
'phonograph' similar to the telegraph machine he was working on.
Although the visible results convinced him that sound could be
physically recorded and played back, his notes show that he did not
actually play back the sound until his first experiment, in which he
used foil as a recording medium several months later. The foil was
wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder, and a sound-vibrating nail
pressed against the foil as the cylinder was rotated. The recording
could be played back instantly. An article in Scientific American
introducing the foliophonograph to the public cited Marey, Rosapelly
and Barlow and Scott as the developers of devices that recorded <font color="#2f4f4f">sound
</font>but did not <font color="#2f4f4f">play it back.</font> Edison
also invented variations of the phonograph using tape and disc
formats. Numerous applications were envisaged for the phonograph, but
although it was in vogue for a while as a striking novelty for public
performances, the foliophonograph proved too crude to be used in
practice. A decade later, Edison developed a much improved phonograph
using a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil plate. This proved to
be both better sounding and a much more useful and durable device.
The wax phonograph cylinder created the sound recording market in the
late <font color="#556b2f">1880s </font>and dominated it in the early
years of the 20th century.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Emile Berliner developed laterally
cut recordings in the United States and named his system the

from Edison's wax cylinder &quot;phonograph&quot; and Columbia's wax
cylinder &quot;graphophone&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font> The
earliest Berliner records, first marketed in 1889 but only in Europe,
were 13 cm (5 inches) in diameter and played on a small hand-operated
machine. Both the discs and the machine were only suitable as toys or
curiosities because the sound quality was poor. In 1894, Berliner
began marketing records with a somewhat more substantial
entertainment value in the United States under the Berliner
Gramophone brand, as well as somewhat more substantial gramophones to
play them. The <font color="#2f4f4f">sound quality of </font>Berliner's
records <font color="#2f4f4f">was poor compared to </font>wax
cylinders, but his production partner Eldridge R. Johnson eventually
improved the sound quality. In 1901, the separate companies of
Johnson and Berliner abandoned the Berliner &quot;Gramophone&quot;
trademark for legal reasons and re-formed the Victor Talking Machine
Company, whose products dominated the market for many years. Emile
Berliner moved his company to Montreal in 1900. The factory that

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1901, 10-inch discs were
introduced, and in 1903, 12-inch discs. These discs had a playing
time of more than three and four minutes, while modern cylinders only
lasted about two minutes. Edison tried to counter the record's lead
and in 1909 introduced <font color="#a9a9a9">the Amberol cylinder,
which had a </font>maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (160
revolutions per minute). Instead, Blue Amberol Records were
introduced, with a playing surface made <font color="#dcdcdc">of

Despite these improvements, records won this early format war
decisively in the 1910s, although Edison continued to produce new

distant or less powerful sounds that were not possible with the old
methods. The volume was now limited only by the groove spacing of the
disc and the limitations of the playback equipment used. Victor and
Columbia licensed the new electronic system from Western Electric and
began releasing electronically recorded discs in <font color="#6b8e23">1925</font>.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The earliest boards (1889-1894) were
made of different materials, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">hard
rubber</font>. Around 1895, <font color="#dcdcdc">a cellulose-based
mixture was introduced and </font>became the standard. The exact
formulas of this mixture varied from manufacturer to manufacturer and
over time, but it generally consisted of about one-third cellulose
and about two-thirds mineral filler, which meant finely ground stone,
usually slate and limestone, to which were added cotton fibres to
increase tensile strength, carbon black to give the colour (without
this it was usually a 'dirty' grey or brown, which most record
companies found objectionable) and a very small amount of <font color="#556b2f">lubricant
</font>to ease the mould's release during manufacture. Some
manufacturers, notably <font color="#6b8e23">Columbia Records</font>,
used a laminating structure with a core sheet of coarser material or
fibre. The production of celluloid records continued until the end of
the 78 rpm format (i.e. the late 1950s in most developed countries,
but well into the 1960s in some others), but in its declining years
increasingly less abrasive compositions were used, and very late,
truly mint condition records can have noise levels as low as vinyl.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At various times during the 78 rpm
era, several manufacturers introduced flexible or so-called
&quot;unbreakable&quot; discs made of unusual materials. In the
United Kingdom, Nicole discs, made of celluloid or similar material
coated on a cardboard core, were produced for a few years from 1904,
but suffered from exceptionally high <font color="#a9a9a9">surface
noise.</font> In the United States, Columbia Records introduced
flexible, fibre-coated &quot;Marconi Velvet Tone Record&quot; in
1907, but the advantages of their relatively soundless surface and
their longevity depended on the conscientious use of special
gold-plated Marconi needles, and the product was not a success. Thin,
flexible plastic sheets, such as the German Phonycord and the British
Filmophone and Goodson records, appeared around 1930, but these too
did not last long. Equally short-lived were the French Pathé
Cellodiscs, which were made of a very thin black plastic that bears a
striking resemblance to the 'phonograph record' leaflets of vinyl
records of the 1965-1985 era. In the US, the Hit of the Week records,
made of a patented translucent plastic <font color="#dcdcdc">called
Durium, </font>coated with a heavy brown paper base, were introduced
in the early 1930s. A new issue appeared every week, and they were
sold on newsstands like weeklies. Although initially inexpensive and
commercially successful, they soon fell victim to the <font color="#2f4f4f">Great
Depression </font>and production in the US ceased in <font color="#556b2f">1932</font>.
Similar Durium records were produced some time later in the UK and
elsewhere, and as late as 1950 in Italy, where the name &quot;Durium&quot;
remained the trademark for ordinary vinyl records well into the LP
era. Despite all these attempts at innovation, <font color="#6b8e23">cellulose

Victor introduced <font color="#dcdcdc">its vinyl-based Victrolac
compound </font>as a material for some unusual and specialty records<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>By the late 1930s, vinyl's <font color="#2f4f4f">lightness,
relative unbreakability and low surface noise </font>made it the
preferred material for pre-recorded radio programs and other critical
applications. For conventional 78 rpm records, <font color="#556b2f">the

material <font color="#556b2f">and </font>its vulnerability to heavy
mufflers and coarse mass-produced steel needles, still commonly used
in home recorders, made the general substitution of vinyl for
cellulose impractical at the time. During World War II, the US armed
forces manufactured thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-records for
use by troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became
more practical as new turntables with relatively lightweight crystal
mufflers and precision-ground pens made of sapphire or an exotic
osmium alloy became common. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering
De Luxe special editions of some classic 78 vinyl records in
transparent red vinyl at de luxe prices. Later, Decca Records
introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, and other record companies developed
vinyl alloys such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but

released. Eight-inch discs, with a 51 mm (2-inch) diameter disc, were
popular in Britain for about a decade, but cannot be played in their
entirety on most modern turntables because the sound arm cannot play
far enough to the centre without <font color="#556b2f">modifying the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The playing time of a record
depended on <font color="#a9a9a9">the speed of the turntable and the

1903 extended the playing time <font color="#2f4f4f">to three and a

rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side, and
since 10 inches was the standard size for popular music, almost all
popular music recordings were limited to about three minutes. For
example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, which Louis Armstrong
was part of for his first recordings, recorded <font color="#6b8e23">13

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In January 1938, Milt Gabler began
recording for his new record company, Commodore Records, and to allow
for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch discs.
Eddie Condon explained: &quot;Gabler realised that the jam session
needed space to develop.&quot; The first two 12-inch recordings did
not take advantage of the extra length: 'Carnegie Drag' was 3:15;
'Carnegie Jump', 2:41. But at the second session on April 30, both
12-inch recordings were longer: &quot;Embraceable You&quot; was 4:05;
&quot;Serenade to a Shylock,&quot; 4:32. Another way around the time
limit was to release a selection on both sides of one disc.
Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded &quot;Mr. Gallagher and
Mr. Shean,&quot; written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, for Cameo in
1922 <font color="#a9a9a9">on two sides of </font>a 10-inch 78. The
obvious solution for longer recordings was to <font color="#dcdcdc">release
a series of discs</font>. An early multi-disc release was in 1903,
when HMV in England made the first recording of a complete opera,
Verdi's Ernan, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released
a recording by Eddie Condon and his band, A Good Man Is Hard to Find,
in four parts, released on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This
restriction on the duration of recordings continued from 1910 until
the invention of the LP in 1948. In popular music, this time limit of
<font color="#2f4f4f">about 3:30 minutes </font>on a 10-inch 78 rpm
record meant that singers did not usually release long songs on disc.
One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording on 28 May 1946 of Rodgers
and Hammerstein's &quot;Soliloquy&quot;, Carousel. Since the song was
7:57 in duration, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch
disc, it was released <font color="#556b2f">on Columbia's Masterwork
label </font>(classical music department) as two sides of a 12-inch
disc. The same was true of John Raitt's performance of the song on
Carousel's original acting disc, released on the American Decca 78
rpm disc set in 1945.</p>

traditional 78 rpm records, which had a cellulose composition and
wider grooves of 3 mm). The record company did this mainly to take
advantage of the wider audio frequency response range that faster
speeds like 78 rpm could offer vinyl records, hence the record
company's name (apparently for audiophiles of the &quot;hi-fi era&quot;
of the 1950s, when stereo equipment could offer a much <font color="#556b2f">wider

narrower grooves intended to be played with a smaller stylus -
typically 0.001 inch (25 µm) wide, compared to 0.003 inch (76 µm)
wide on 78s - so the new discs were sometimes called Microgroove. <font color="#6b8e23">In

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Mercury
Records</font>, under the direction of recording engineer C. Robert
Fine, began the minimalist single-microphone monaural recording
technique in 1951. The first recording, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra
performance of Pictures at an Exhibition conducted by Rafael Kubelik,
was described by The New York Times music critic as &quot;the living
presence of an orchestra&quot;. The album series was then called
Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo
recordings, still based on the single-microphone principle<font color="#dcdcdc">.
</font>The central microphone (one microphone) was of primary
importance, and two side microphones added depth and spaciousness.
The disc masters were cut directly from the three-track and two-track
mixer consoles, and all editing of the master tapes was done on the
original three-track. In 1961, Mercury improved on this technique
with three-mic stereo recordings using 35 mm magnetic tape instead of
half-inch tape. The greater thickness and width of the 35 mm magnetic
diaphragm <font color="#556b2f">prevented tape-layer bleed-through
and pre-echo effects, and allowed for an extended frequency range and
transient response. </font><font color="#6b8e23">Mercury's </font>Living
Presence recordings were mastered on CD in the 1990s by original
producer Wilma Cozart Fine using the same method of mixing 3 to 2
recordings directly onto a master tape recorder.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s,
various methods were used to improve the dynamic range of
mass-produced records using highly sophisticated record cutting
equipment. These techniques, marketed under names such as <font color="#a9a9a9">CBS
DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, </font>were used to
reduce internal groove distortion. <font color="#dcdcdc">RCA Victor
</font>introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve
a groove with less surface noise, commercially called Dynagroove. It
combined two main elements: a second disc material with less surface
noise in the groove, and dynamic compression to mask background
noise. This was sometimes called 'foiling' the source material, and
was not favoured by some music lovers <font color="#2f4f4f">because
of its unnatural side effects.</font> Both elements were reflected in
the Dynagroove brand, described in more detail elsewhere. It also
used an earlier, more advanced method of controlling the pitch of the
groove in terms of volume and position of the record. At <font color="#556b2f">lower
recorded volumes, </font>tighter spacing was used; at higher volumes,
<font color="#6b8e23">wider spacing </font>was used, especially at
lower frequencies. The higher track density at lower volumes also
allowed the recordings to end up further away from the centre of the
disc than usual, which helped to further reduce track distortion.</p>

(LP) and &quot;extended-play&quot; (EP) </font>describe multi-track
records that play for much longer than one-track-per-side records,
which usually last no more than four minutes per side. An LP can last
up to 30 minutes per side, but most records last about <font color="#dcdcdc">22
minutes </font>per side, so the total playing time of a typical LP is
about <font color="#2f4f4f">45 minutes.</font> However, many LPs
released before 1952 lasted about 15 minutes per side. The seven-inch
45 rpm format usually contains one track per side, but <font color="#556b2f">seven-inch
EPs </font>could achieve a recording time of 10-15 minutes, but sound
attenuation and compression was necessary to reduce the width of the
track. EPs were generally used to make tracks that were not available
on singles, including LP album tracks, available in a smaller and
more affordable format for those who only had 45 rpm players. The
large centre hole of 7-inch 45 rpm discs facilitated the handling of
jukebox mechanisms. The term &quot;album&quot;, originally used to
refer to a &quot;book&quot; containing several 78 rpm discs, each
with its own &quot;page&quot; or sleeve, no longer has any relation
to the physical format: the single LP or, more typically today, the

created by turning: a lathe is used to cut a modulated groove in a
blank disc. The cutting engineer prepared the cut-outs as required,
using a 'metallic soap' described by Robert K. Morrison, which
included lead nitrate, ozokerite, barium sulphate, montan wax,
stearin and paraffin. The cut 'wax' sheets were placed in a vacuum
chamber and gold dusted to make them electrically conductive and
could be used as shafts in an electroforming bath to make pressable
stamper parts. Later, the French company Pyral invented a finished
blank sheet with a thin nitrocellulose lacquer coating (about 7 mm
thick on both sides) applied to an aluminium substrate. The result of
the lacquer cuts was an immediately playable or processable master
disc. If vinyl recordings are desired, the unplayed record is used as
a spindle for electroformed nickel plates used in the manufacture of
stamping presses. Electroformed nickel plates are mechanically
detached from their own axle. This is relatively easy, because the
electroplating process known as electroforming does not involve any
actual 'plating', unlike electroplating, where the attachment of a
new metal phase is chemical and relatively permanent. A one-molecule
thick silver coating (sprayed onto a treated lacquer sheet to make
its surface electrically conductive) is coated onto the surface of a
nickel sheet. This negative re-surfacing (with ridges instead of
grooves) is called a nickel master, &quot;matrix&quot; or &quot;master&quot;.
The &quot;father&quot; is then used as an axis to electroform the
positive plate, called the &quot;mother&quot;. Several mother plates
can be grown on a single &quot;father&quot; before the ridges
deteriorate to the point where they can no longer be used
effectively. The &quot;mothers&quot; are then used as axes to
electroform more negative plates, called &quot;sons&quot;. For each
&quot;mother&quot;, several &quot;sons&quot; can be produced before
they deteriorate. &quot;The 'sons' are then converted into 'stamps'
by punching a hole in the centre of the spindle (which disappeared
from the varnished sound plate during the initial electroforming of
the 'father') and shaping the extrusion profile. This allows them to
be placed in the mould of the target press (make and model) and
facilitates the attachment of the label by roughening the centre
surface, so that the label attaches to the vinyl press without glue.
In this way, several million vinyl records can be produced from a
single lacquered record. When only a few hundred records are needed,
instead of electroforming the &quot;son&quot; (on each side), the
<font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;father&quot; is removed from the silver
and turned into a stamper. The </font>latter method, known as the
&quot;two-step process&quot; (because it does not produce &quot;sons&quot;
but produces &quot;mothers&quot;, which are used for test playing and
kept as &quot;backups&quot; for electroforming future &quot;sons&quot;),
is <font color="#dcdcdc">limited to a few hundred vinyl editions.
This </font>number can be increased if the stamper holds out and the
<font color="#2f4f4f">quality of the </font>vinyl<font color="#2f4f4f">
is high. The </font>&quot;<font color="#556b2f">sons&quot; </font>made
during &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">three-stage</font>&quot;
electroforming are better stamps because they do not require silver
removal (which reduces the high fidelity somewhat because etching
removes some of the smallest groove modulations) and because their
metal structure is stronger than that of the &quot;fathers&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The pen's slip forces and other
disturbances are also reflected in the pen. This is a form of
frequency ambiguity, since the control signal (the feedback force)
used to hold the pen in the groove is transmitted through the same
mechanism as the sound itself. The <font color="#dcdcdc">sound
frequencies below 20 Hz in the sound </font>signal are dominated by
reverberation effects, a form of unwanted rumble (&quot;reverberant
noise&quot;), which merges with the audible frequencies in the deep
bass range up to about 100 Hz. High-precision sound reproduction
equipment can reproduce reverberation and hum. During silent
pass-through, <font color="#2f4f4f">the cones of </font>bass speakers
<font color="#2f4f4f">can sometimes be seen vibrating with the
subsonic reverberation of a </font>pencil at frequencies as low as
just above 0.5 Hz (the frequency at which a 33 1⁄3 rpm record spins
on a turntable; 5⁄9 Hz on an exactly ideal turntable). Another
reason for very low-frequency material may be <font color="#556b2f">a
warped record</font>: its waviness produces frequencies of only a few
hertz, and today's amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this
reason, many stereo receivers included a switchable subwoofer<font color="#6b8e23">
filter.</font> Some of the subwoofer content is directly out of phase
with each channel. If played back with a mono subwoofer system, the
noise is cancelled out, greatly reducing the amount of noise that can
be reproduced.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Due to the limitations of recording
mastering and manufacturing, both high and low frequencies were
removed from the first recorded signals using different patterns. At
low frequencies, the stylus has to swing far from side to side,
resulting in a wide groove, which takes up more space and <font color="#a9a9a9">limits
the playing time of the </font>record. At high frequencies, <font color="#dcdcdc">hisses,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry
C. Harrison of Bell Telephone Laboratories revealed that the
recording pattern of Western Electric's &quot;rubber line&quot;
magnetic disk recorder had a constant speed feature. This meant that
as the frequency increased in the treble, the <font color="#a9a9a9">amplitude
of the recording decreased. </font>Conversely, in the bass, as the
frequency decreased, <font color="#dcdcdc">the recording amplitude
increased.</font> It was therefore necessary to attenuate bass
frequencies below 250 Hz, i.e. below the bass crossover point, in the
amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, the
bass modulation became excessive and over-cutting occurred in the
next recording track. When the sound was reproduced electrically with
a magnetic transducer with a flat response in the bass region, the
amplitude had to be amplified additionally at the bass changeover
point. <font color="#2f4f4f">G. H. Miller </font>reported in 1934

Early electronic recordings were similar in sound to acoustic

<font color="#2f4f4f">carbon microphones</font>, whose resonances
coloured the recorded sound. A double-button carbon microphone with a
stretched diaphragm was a significant improvement. Alternatively, the

It had a flatter sound response than <font color="#a9a9a9">the</font>
old-style <font color="#a9a9a9">Wente condenser microphone and did
not require any electronics mounted in the microphone housing. The
</font>signals fed to the cutting head were pre-corrected at the

Vertical groove cuts were used instead of conventional side cuts. The
main advantage was claimed to be that there were more grooves per
inch that could be sealed together, thus <font color="#2f4f4f">extending
the playback time. In </font>addition, the vertical cutting system
avoided the problem of <font color="#556b2f">intra-groove distortion
</font>that plagued lateral cuts. The wax masters were made by

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There is a theory that <font color="#a9a9a9">vinyl
records </font>can play higher frequencies than CDs. According to Red
Book specifications, the frequency response of a CD is from 20 Hz to
22 050 Hz, and most CD players measure a flat frequency at a fraction
of a decibel from at least 20 Hz to 20 kHz at full power. Turntable
rumble masks the low end of vinyl, but the top end can be reasonably
flat on some cassettes by a few decibels up to 30 kHz with a gentle
roll-off. At 30 kHz, the carrier wave signals of the Quad LPs popular
in the 1970s were outside the range of human hearing. The average
human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from <font color="#dcdcdc">20

then they stopped giving refunds for returns at all. Retailers,
fearing they would have to stock up on everything they ordered,
ordered only tried and tested, popular titles that they knew would
sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record
companies also removed many vinyl labels from production and
distribution, further reducing the availability of the format and
leading to the closure of printing plants. The rapid decline in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Many
electronic dance music and hip hop releases are still preferably
vinyl, but </font>digital copies are still widely available. This is
because record producers (&quot;DJs&quot;) have the advantage of
vinyl over CDs: <font color="#dcdcdc">direct manipulation of </font>the
medium. DJ techniques such as <font color="#2f4f4f">slip-cueing,
beatmatching and scratching are </font>derived from turntables. CDs
or CD cassettes usually have only indirect manipulation
possibilities, such as play, stop and pause buttons. On discs, the
stylus can be set a few grooves deeper or further away, accelerate or
decelerate the turntable or even reverse its direction, <font color="#556b2f">if
the design of the stylus, the turntable and the disc can withstand
it. </font><font color="#6b8e23">However, many CDJ and DJ systems
today, such as DJ software and time-coded vinyl, have these and other
features.</font></p>
