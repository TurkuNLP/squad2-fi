<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Recent developments in LEDs have
made them suitable for <font color="#a9a9a9">environmental </font>and
task lighting. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent lamps,
such as lower energy consumption, <font color="#dcdcdc">longer
lifetime</font>, better physical durability, smaller size and faster
switching. <font color="#2f4f4f">LEDs </font>are now used in
applications as diverse as aviation lighting, car headlights,
advertising, general lighting, <font color="#556b2f">traffic signs</font>,
camera flashes and illuminated wallpaper. As of 2015[update], LEDs
that are efficient enough for room lighting are still somewhat <font color="#6b8e23">more

<font color="#a9a9a9">Texas </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Instruments
</font>in Dallas, <font color="#2f4f4f">Texas</font>, James R. Biard
and Gary Pittman observed near-infrared (900 nm) light emanating from
a tunnel diode they had built on a GaAs substrate. By October 1961,
they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling
between a GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically
isolated semiconductor light detector. Biard and Pittman applied for
a patent on 8 August 1962 for a &quot;Semiconductor Radiant Diode&quot;
based on their results, which described a zinc-doped p-n junction LED
with a cathode contact positioned so that the emission of infrared
light was effective in the forward bias position. Having established
the priority of their work on the basis of technical notes preceding
applications from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs,
Bell Labs and MIT Lincoln Labs, the US Patent Office granted two
inventors a patent for a <font color="#a0522d">GaAs infrared </font><font color="#228b22">(IR)
light-emitting diode </font>(US patent US3293513), the first
practical LED. <font color="#191970">Texas Instruments (TI) </font>started
a project to manufacture infrared diodes immediately after the patent
application was filed. In October 1962, TI announced the first
commercial LED product (SNX-100), which used pure GaAs crystal to
emit 890 nm light. In October 1963, TI introduced the first
commercial hemispherical LED, the SNX-110.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The first commercial LEDs were
widely used <font color="#a9a9a9">as replacements for incandescent
and neon lights </font>and in seven-segment displays, first in
expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronic test equipment,
and later in devices such as televisions, radios, telephones,
<font color="#dcdcdc">calculators </font>and clocks (see list of
signal uses). Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were very
expensive, <font color="#556b2f">costing </font>around <font color="#556b2f">USD
200 per unit, </font>so had little practical use. The Monsanto
Company was the first organization to mass produce visible LEDs using
gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs
suitable for indicators. <font color="#6b8e23">Hewlett Packard </font><font color="#a0522d">(HP)
</font>introduced LEDs in 1968, initially using GaAsP supplied by
Monsanto. These red LEDs were bright enough to be used only as
indicator lights, as they did not have sufficient light output to
illuminate an area. The numbers on <font color="#228b22">the counters
</font>were so small that plastic lenses were built over each number
to make them legible. Later, other colours became widely available
and appeared on equipment and appliances. Fairchild Optoelectronics
produced commercially successful LED devices in <font color="#191970">the
1970s at </font>less than five cents each. These devices used
compound semiconductor chips manufactured using the planar process
invented by Fairchild Semiconductor's Dr Jean Hoern. The Fairchild
team, led by optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt, was able to
achieve the necessary cost reductions by combining planar processing
and innovative packaging techniques for chip manufacturing. LED
manufacturers continue to use these methods.</p>

doping remains the basis of all commercial blue LEDs and laser
diodes. These devices, built in the early 1970s, had too little light
output to be of practical use and research into gallium nitride
devices slowed down. In August 1989, Cree introduced the first
commercially available blue LED based on an indirect bandgap

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Multicolour LEDs offer not just a
new way to create white light, but a new way <font color="#a9a9a9">to
create different coloured light</font>. Most observable colours can
be created by mixing different amounts of the three basic colours.
This allows precise dynamic colour adjustment. As more and more
research is put into this method, multi-colour LED lights should have
a profound impact on the fundamental method we use to generate and
control the colour of light. However, before this type of LED can
establish itself in the market, a number of technical problems need
to be solved. These include the fact that the <font color="#dcdcdc">emissivity
of </font>this type of LED <font color="#dcdcdc">decreases
exponentially with increasing temperature</font>, leading to <font color="#2f4f4f">a

and may prevent industrial use. Many new package designs have been
proposed to solve this problem, and the results are now being
replicated by researchers and scientists.</p>

are due to <font color="#a9a9a9">heat loss from the Stokes shift </font>and
also other phosphor-related degradation problems. Their luminous
efficacy compared to conventional LEDs depends on <font color="#2f4f4f">the
spectral distribution of the light output generated </font><font color="#556b2f">and

</font>has a luminous efficiency <font color="#a0522d">3-5 times
higher than </font>the original blue LED, because the human eye is
more sensitive to yellow than blue (as modelled by the luminous

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The current-voltage characteristic
of LEDs is similar to that of other diodes, as the <font color="#dcdcdc">current
depends exponentially </font><font color="#a9a9a9">on the voltage
</font>(see Shockley's diode equation). This means <font color="#2f4f4f">that
</font><font color="#556b2f">a small change in voltage </font>can
cause a large change in current. If the applied voltage exceeds the
forward voltage drop of the LED by a small amount, the rated current
can be exceeded by a large amount, which can damage or destroy the
LED. A typical solution is to <font color="#6b8e23">use </font><font color="#a0522d">constant
current power supplies </font>to keep the current below the maximum
current rating of the LED. Since most common power sources
(<font color="#228b22">batteries</font>, mains) are constant voltage
sources, most LED luminaires must <font color="#191970">have </font><font color="#8b0000">a
current transformer </font>or at least a current limiting resistor.
However, the high resistance of three-volt coin cells combined with
the high differential resistance of nitride-based LEDs makes it
possible to supply current to the LED from such coin cells without an
external resistor.</p>

a signal source. LEDs are often the ideal light source due to the
requirements of the sensors. LEDs are used as motion sensors in

monochromatic, as the page to be scanned is always illuminated with
only one colour of light. Since LEDs can also be used as light
emitting diodes, they can be used for both light emission and
detection. This could be used, for example, in a touch screen that
registers the light reflected by a finger or pen. Many materials and
biological systems are sensitive to or dependent on light. LED lights
are used in grow lights <font color="#a0522d">to enhance

</font>term was first coined by <font color="#dcdcdc">William T.R.

British Empire </font>lost its superpower status, leaving the United
States and the Soviet Union as the world's superpowers.[nb 2] The
term '<font color="#191970">middle power' has been </font>coined <font color="#8b0000">for
nations that have some global influence but not enough to play a
decisive role in international affairs.</font> Regional superpowers
are those whose influence is generally limited to their own region of

several reasons why this has happened, the main one being the
unprecedented rise and dominance of the <font color="#2f4f4f">United

other superpower has been able to achieve parity or near parity <font color="#556b2f">with

</font>are the last surviving dinosaurs to have evolved from their
feathered ancestor in the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs.
True birds first appeared in <font color="#dcdcdc">the Cretaceous
period </font>about 100 million years ago. DNA evidence shows that
birds diversified dramatically around the time of the
Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinction, when all other dinosaurs died out.
South American birds survived this event and then migrated across
several land bridges to the rest of the world, diversifying during
the global cooling. Outside of the Aves proper, bird-like primitive
dinosaurs belonging to the broader Avialae group have been found
since the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early 'parent birds',
such as <font color="#2f4f4f">Archaeopteryx</font>, were not yet able
to fly at full speed, and many had primitive features such as toothed
jaws instead of beaks and long bony tails.</p>

species of birds make and use tools, and many social species pass on
knowledge from one generation to the next, in what is considered a
form of culture. Many species migrate long distances each year. Birds
are social, communicating with each other through visual signals,
calls and songs, and engaging in social behaviours such as communal
breeding and hunting, flocking and harassment of predators. The vast
majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one
breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for their
entire lives. Other species have polygynous ('many females') or,
rarely, polyandrous ('many males') reproductive systems. Birds
produce offspring <font color="#dcdcdc">by laying eggs, which are
fertilised by sexual reproduction. </font>They are usually laid <font color="#2f4f4f">in
a nest </font>and incubated by the parents. Most birds have a long
period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as chickens,
also lay eggs unfertilised, but unfertilised eggs do not produce

those who favour the phylocode system. <font color="#dcdcdc">Gauthier
</font>defined Aves as including only the crown group of modern
birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils
and placing them instead in the Avialae, partly to avoid uncertainty

whether the radiation of the remaining neognaths occurred before or

acid instead of urea or ammonia through the urinary tract into the

excreted in faeces as semi-solid waste. However, birds, such as
hummingbirds, can be facultatively ammonotelic, in which case they
excrete most of the nitrogenous waste as ammonia. They also excrete
creatine rather than creatinine as mammals do. This substance, as
well as intestinal output, comes out of the bird's cloaca. The <font color="#2f4f4f">cloaca

Males of the Palaeognathae (except kiwis), males of the Anseriformes
(except cuckoos) and primitive forms of the Galliformes (but fully
developed males of the Cracidae) have a penis that is never present

When not mating, it is hidden in the proctodeum chamber in the

with a cornea for storage and a stomach containing swallowed stones
for grinding food to make up for the lack of teeth. Most birds are

the other during contraction. Because the heart is myogenic, the
pacing of the heart is maintained by pacemaker cells in the sinus
node in the right atrium. The atrial sinus node uses calcium to
induce a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium
through the right and left atrioventricular chambers that mediates
contraction in the ventricles. The avian heart is also composed of
muscle arches, which consist of thick bundles of muscle layers. Like
the mammalian heart, the avian heart consists of an endocardial,
myocardial and epicardial layer. The walls of the atrium are
generally thinner than those of the ventricle, because the ventricle
contracts strongly to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Bird

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 22</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Birds have a very efficient system
for diffusing oxygen into the blood; the surface area of birds is ten
times greater than the gas exchange volume of mammals. As a result,
birds have more blood per unit volume of lung capillaries than
mammals. Arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles <font color="#a9a9a9">that
can withstand the pressure of ventricular contraction and </font>become
stiffer as they move away from the heart. <font color="#dcdcdc">Blood
</font>moves through the arteries experiencing vasoconstriction to
the arteries, which act as a transport system, primarily distributing
oxygen and nutrients to all tissues in the body. As the arteries move
away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues, they
divide further to increase surface area and slow blood flow. As blood
passes through the arteries, it moves into capillaries where gas
exchange can take place. In tissues, <font color="#2f4f4f">capillaries
</font>organise themselves into capillary beds, where blood exchanges
oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In capillary leaks, blood flow slows
down to maximise oxygen diffusion to the tissues. Once the blood is
deoxygenated, it travels through the veins, then the venous system
and back to the heart. Unlike arteries, veins are thin and stiff
because they do not have to withstand extreme pressure. As blood
passes through the veins into the arteries, <font color="#556b2f">dilation
of the arteries </font>occurs, bringing the blood back to the heart.
Once in the heart, the blood moves first into the right atrium and
then into the right ventricle, from where it is pumped to the lungs,
where the carbon dioxide gas is further converted into oxygen. The
oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium
into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out into the body.</p>

ultraviolet-reflecting plumage patterns that are invisible to the
human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye can
be distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet-reflecting patches in
their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet-reflecting crown

and raise their neck feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used for
foraging. Rodents have been shown to seek prey by detecting
UV-reflective urine trails left on the ground by rodents. Birds'
eyelids are not used for blinking. Instead, the eye is lubricated by
a nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The

a characteristic of birds (although they were also present on some

growths attached to the skin and occur only <font color="#dcdcdc">in
certain areas of the skin, </font>called pteryla. The pattern of

birds </font>changes regularly; the standard plumage of a bird that
has changed after breeding is called a <font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;non-breeding&quot;
plumage </font>or, in Humphrey-Parkes terminology, a &quot;basic&quot;
plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are
known as &quot;alternative&quot; plumages in the Humphrey-Parkes
system. Most species have an <font color="#2f4f4f">annual </font>moult,
although some species may have two moulting cycles per year, and
<font color="#556b2f">large birds of prey </font>may moult only once
every few years. Species-specific patterns of moulting vary. In
birds, flight feathers are replaced one at a time, with the innermost
feather being replaced first. When the fifth or sixth main feather is
replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to fall off. When the
innermost tertiary feathers are replaced, the secondary feathers
start to fall from the innermost, and this continues to the outermost
feathers (centrifugal phase). The larger primary coverts are plucked
in synchrony with the primary, so that they overlap. Some species,
such as ducks and geese, lose all their flight feathers at once and
become temporarily flightless. Usually the tail feathers are skinned
and replaced starting with the innermost pair. However,
centrifugation of tail feathers occurs in the Phasianidae. The
centrifugal feather plumage has been modified in wood warblers and
wood warblers by starting from the second innermost pair of feathers
and ending at the middle pair of feathers so that the bird retains a
functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in birds is that
the primaries are positioned outwards, the secondaries inwards and
the tail is positioned from the middle outwards. Before nesting,
females of most bird species obtain a bare nesting site by shedding
feathers near the abdomen. The skin there is well vascularised and
helps the bird to incubate.</p>

advantage of global differences in seasonal temperatures to optimise
the availability of food sources and nesting habitat. These
migrations vary between groups. Many land, shore and water birds
undertake long-distance migrations each year, usually due to daylight
hours and weather conditions. For these birds, the breeding season is
typically spent in temperate or polar regions and the non-breeding
season in tropical regions or in the opposite hemisphere. <font color="#a9a9a9">Prior
to migration, </font>birds significantly increase body fats and
reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs. Migration is a
very demanding energy expenditure, especially when birds have to
cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds fly about <font color="#dcdcdc">2

make long migratory journeys, with the longest annual migration being
that of sooty terns, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend
the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska
and California, making an annual round trip of 64 000 kilometres.
Other seabirds disperse after breeding and travel widely, but they do

migratory journeys, travelling only as far as necessary to avoid bad
weather or to forage for food. Irregular species include boreal
finches, which are usually seen in one place one year and absent the
next. This type of migration is usually related to food availability.
Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range,
with individuals from higher latitudes migrating to the current range
of their conspecifics; other species make partial migrations, with
only part of the population, usually females and sub-adult males,
migrating. Partial migration can account for a large proportion of
bird migration behaviour in some areas; in Australia, surveys found

altitude migration </font>is a short-distance migration pattern where
birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and migrate to

may also be nomadic, in which case they have no fixed territory and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The ability of birds to return to
well-defined locations over long distances has been known for some
time. In a 1950s experiment in Boston, a released Manx wood pigeon
returned to its nest in Skomer, Wales, within 13 days, a distance of
5 150 kilometres (3 200 mi). Birds navigate their migratory journey
using a variety of methods. <font color="#a9a9a9">Day butterflies </font>use
the sun to navigate during the day and a star compass at night. Birds
that use the sun to navigate compensate for changes in the sun's

during the active part of the day is complemented by rest at other
times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as <font color="#a9a9a9">wakeful

</font>are thought to be able to sleep in flight, and radar
observations have shown that they face the wind when resting. It has
been suggested that certain types of sleep are also possible in
flight. Some birds have also shown the ability to fall into a
slow-wave sleep with one hemisphere of the brain at a time. Birds
tend to use this ability depending on their position relative to the
outside of the flock. This may allow the opposite eye of the sleeping
hemisphere to remain alert for predators by watching the outer edges
of the flock. This adaptation is also known in marine mammals.

religion, birds can act either as messengers of the deity or as

Hugin and Munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the
ears of the Norse god Odin. In many ancient Italian civilisations,
especially Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in
divination, i.e. interpreting the words of the birds while the
'<font color="#dcdcdc">auspex</font>' (from which the word
'auspicious' derives) observed their actions to predict events. They
could also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">יוֹנָה</span></font>,

traditionally associated with doves. Birds themselves have been
deified, such as the common peacock, which the Indian Dravidians
regard as Mother Earth. In religious images from the Inca and
Tiwanaku kingdoms, birds are depicted crossing the boundaries between
the terrestrial and subterranean spirit worlds. Indigenous peoples in

the magnificent peacock trong of the Mughals and Persian emperors. As

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The dynasty was founded by <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Aisin Gioro clan of Jurchen in </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Manchuria</font>.
In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal,
began to organise the Jurchen clans into 'banner', military-social
units. Nurhaci formed these clans into a single entity, whose
subjects were collectively known as manchus. By 1636, his son Hong
Taiji began to drive the Ming forces out of Liaodong and proclaimed a
new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by <font color="#2f4f4f">Li
Zicheng </font>conquered the Ming capital <font color="#556b2f">Beijing</font>.
Instead of serving them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with
the Manchus and opened the <font color="#6b8e23">Shanhai Pass </font>to
the Banner armies led by Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and
took Beijing. The actual conquest of China was not completed until
1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1661-1722). The Qianlong
emperor's ten major military campaigns from the 1750s to the 1790s
extended Qing rule into Central Asia. Although the early rulers
retained their manchu style, and although their official title was
emperor, they were known to the Mongols as khans and they protected
Tibetan Buddhism, they ruled using Confucian styles and institutions
of bureaucratic government. They maintained imperial degrees, which
they used to recruit Han Chinese to work under or alongside the
Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of tribute in international
relations, and in places such as Taiwan, the Qing's so-called
domestic foreign policy closely resembled colonial policy and
control.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The reign of the Qianlong Emperor
<font color="#a9a9a9">(1735-1796) </font>was the peak and beginning
of prosperity and imperial rule. The population grew to around 400
million, but taxes and government revenues remained low, virtually
guaranteeing a fiscal crisis. Corruption spread, rebels put the
legitimacy of the government to the test, and the ruling elite did
not change their mindset in the face of changes in the world system.
After the Opium War, the major European powers placed unequal
treaties, free trade, extraterritoriality and treaty ports under
foreign control. The Taiping Rebellion <font color="#dcdcdc">(1850-64)
</font>and the Dungan Rebellion <font color="#2f4f4f">(1862-77) </font>in
Central Asia led to the deaths of some <font color="#556b2f">20
million people</font>. Despite these disasters, in the Tongzhi
Restoration of the 1860s, Han Chinese elites allied to defend the
Confucian order and the Qing rulers. The first gains of the
self-assertion movement were destroyed in the first Sino-Japanese war
of <font color="#6b8e23">1895</font>, in which the Qing lost its
influence in Korea and control of Taiwan<font color="#6b8e23">.</font>
New armies were organised, but the ambitious Hundred Days Reform of
1898 was reversed by the Empress Dowager Cixi, a ruthless but capable
leader. When foreign powers invaded China in response to the
violently anti-foreign Yihetuan ('boxers'), the empress declared war
on them, leading to defeat and the flight of the imperial court to
Xi'an.</p>

of the meaning of the word Qīng (literally &quot;bright&quot; or

Ming dynasty name (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">明</font>), which is
composed of the Chinese letters for the sun (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">日</font>)

&quot;water&quot; (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">氵</font>) and &quot;azure&quot;
(<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">青</font>), both related to the water
element. This association would justify the Qing's conquest of fire
as the conquest of water. <font color="#2f4f4f">The water imagery in

assimilated the lands of the Qing state (including present-day

The Manchus are sometimes misleadingly mistaken for a nomadic people,
which they were not. The Manchu state was founded in the early 1600s
by Jianzhoussa Nurhaci, who was the chief of a small tribe of Jurchen
- the Aisin Gioro. Originally a vassal of the Ming emperors, in 1582
Nurhachi started an intertribal feud that escalated into a campaign
to unite the nearby tribes. By 1616, he had consolidated Jianzhou
sufficiently to declare himself Khan of Greater Jin, referring to the

bureaucracy employed many Han Chinese, including many newly
surrendered Ming-era officials. Manchu dominance was ensured by an
ethnic quota for the appointment of senior officials. Hong Taiji's
reign also saw a fundamental change in his policy towards his Han
Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated the Han Chinese of Liaodong
differently according to how much grain they had: those with less
than 5-7 sin were treated as property, while those with more were
rewarded with a fortune. In the wake of the <font color="#2f4f4f">1623
</font>rebellion by the Han of <font color="#dcdcdc">Liaodong</font>,
Nurhachi, who had previously made concessions to the conquered Han of
Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they could no longer
be trusted; he introduced a discriminatory policy and killed against
them, while ordering that Han who had merged with the Yurchen (in
Jilin) before 1619 were to be treated on an equal <font color="#2f4f4f">footing</font>
with the Yurchen and not like the conquered Han of Liaodong. Instead,
Hong Taiji incorporated them into the Jurchen 'nation' as full (if
not first-class) citizens, obliged to perform military service. By
1648, less than <font color="#556b2f">one-sixth of </font>the
bannermen were of Manchu origin. This change in policy not only
increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence
on the bannermen, who were not under his personal control, but also
greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to
surrender and accept Jurchen's authority when they suffered military
defeat. By these and other measures, Hong Taiji was able to
centralise power in the office of the Khan, which in the long run
prevented the break-up of the Churian Federation after his death.</p>

1645 (<font color="#a9a9a9">'the haircut order') </font>forced adult
Han Chinese men, on pain of death, to shave the front of their heads
and comb the remaining hair into a queue hairstyle used by the
Manchus. A popular description of the order was: <font color="#dcdcdc">'If
you want to keep your hair, you lose your head; if you want to keep
your head, you cut your hair'.</font> For the Manchus, this practice
was a test of loyalty and a tool to distinguish friend from foe. For
the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of the
authority of the Qing, challenging traditional Confucian values. The
classic of filial piety (Xiaojing) held that 'the human body and
hair, which are a gift from parents, must not be harmed'. During the
Ming Dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair, but kept it <font color="#2f4f4f">as
a topknot.</font> The decree sparked strong resistance in Jiangnan
against the Qing regime and a massive killing of ethnic Han Chinese.
Han Chinese defectors carried out massacres against people who
refused to stand in line... Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who
had served the Ming Empire but surrendered to the Qing Empire,
ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in
<font color="#556b2f">Jiading </font>City within a month, killing
tens of thousands of people. By the end of the third massacre, there
was barely a single living person left in the city. Jiangyin also
held out against some 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days.
When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Han
Chinese Qing army, led by the Han Chinese Ming-era defector Liu
Liangzuo (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">劉良佐</font>), who had been
ordered to 'fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your
swords', slaughtered the entire population, killing between 74 000
and 100 000 people. The queue was the only part of Manchu culture
that the Qing imposed on the ordinary Han population. Qing required
officials to wear Manchu clothing, but allowed non-official Han
civilians to continue to wear Hanfu (Han clothing).</p>

social, economic and military power. Kangxi's long reign began when
he was <font color="#556b2f">eight years old </font>after the
untimely death of his father. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon's
monopolization of dictatorial power during his reign, Emperor
Shunzhi, on his deathbed, hastily appointed four high-ranking
ministers to rule on behalf of his young son. These four ministers -
Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha and Oboi - were chosen because of their long
service, but also because of their ability to counteract each other's
influences. Most importantly, the four were not closely related to
the imperial family and made no claims to the throne. Over time,
however, through chance and intrigue, <font color="#6b8e23">Oboi</font>,
the youngest of the four, achieved such political power that he
became a potential threat. Although Oboi's loyalty was never a
problem, his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him
into an escalating conflict with the young emperor. In 1669, Kangxi
disarmed and imprisoned Oboi - a major victory for the
fifteen-year-old emperor over a shrewd politician and experienced
commander.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The early Manchus also created two
bases of legitimacy that help explain the stability of their dynasty.
The first was the bureaucratic institutions and neo-Confucian culture
they had inherited from previous dynasties. The Manchu rulers and the
Han Chinese elite of scholars and officials gradually came to get
along. The education system provided a pathway for ethnic Han to
become civil servants. Imperial protection of the Kangxi Dictionary
showed respect for <font color="#a9a9a9">Confucian </font>scholarship,
while <font color="#dcdcdc">the 1670 Holy Decree </font>effectively
extolled Confucian family values. Another important source of
stability was the Central Asian dimension of Manchu identity, which
allowed them to appeal to the<font color="#2f4f4f"> Mongol, Tibetan
and </font>Uyghur populations. The Qing used the title of emperor
(Huangdi) in Chinese, while among the Mongols the Qing ruler was
called Bogda Khan (Wise Khan) and among the Tibetans Gong Ma.
Qianlong spread the image of himself as a Buddhist sage ruler, the
protector of Tibetan Buddhism. In Manchu, the Qing ruler was referred
to alternately as Huwangdi (emperor) or Khan, with no particular
distinction between the two usages. The Kangxi emperor also welcomed
to his court <font color="#556b2f">Jesuit missionaries who </font>had
arrived in China for the first time during the Ming Empire.
Missionaries such as Tomás Pereira, Martino Martini, Johann Adam
Schall von Bell, Ferdinand Verbiest and Antoine Thomas played
important roles as military weapons experts, mathematicians,
cartographers, astronomers and advisers to the emperor. However, the
relationship of trust was lost in a later dispute between the
Chinese.</p>

of heaven&quot; was a daunting task. Given the vastness of Chinese
territory, banner troops were only sufficient to guard key cities,
which formed the backbone of a defensive network that relied heavily
on surrendered Ming soldiers. In addition, three surrendered Ming
generals were chosen for their contribution to the founding of the
Qing dynasty, ennobled as feudal princes (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">藩王</font>)

The young emperor granted his retirement, but denied the hereditary

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When Wu Sangui, later joined by Geng
Zhongming and Shang Kex's son Shang Zhixin, was forced to give up
power, they felt they had no choice but to revolt. The ensuing Three
Feudatories Rebellion lasted <font color="#a9a9a9">eight years</font>.
<font color="#dcdcdc">Wu </font>attempted, ultimately unsuccessfully,
to ignite the embers of the Ming religion in southern China by
restoring Ming customs, ordering that the outlawed queues be cut, and
proclaiming himself emperor of the new dynasty. At the height of
their rebellious fortunes, they extended their power as far north as
the Yangtze River and came close to establishing a divided China. Wu
then hesitated to move further north, unable to coordinate his
strategy with his allies, and Kangxi was able to rally his forces for
a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu rulers. By <font color="#2f4f4f">1681</font>,
the Qing government had gained control of a devastated southern
China, which took several decades to recover<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font>
The Manchu generals and bannermen were initially embarrassed by the
superior performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who
outfought them against the rebels, and Kangxi took note of this and
tasked generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong with leading
the Green Standard soldiers to crush the rebels. Qing thought that
the Han Chinese were superior in fighting <font color="#556b2f">other
Han nations</font>, and so they used the Green Standard Army as the
dominant and majority army to crush the rebels instead of the
Bannerites. Similarly, in northwest China against Wang Fuchen, the
Qing used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese
generals such as Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao and Zhang Yong as their
primary military force. This choice was due to the rocky terrain
which favoured infantry over cavalry, the desire to keep the
bannermen in reserve and, again, the belief that Han troops were
better suited to fighting other Han nations. These Han generals
achieved victory over the rebels. Also because of the mountainous
terrain, the Han Chinese Green Flag army led by Wang Jinbao and Zhao
Liangdong retook Sichuan and southern Shaanxi in 1680, with the
Manchus only involved in logistics and supplies. During the war,
<font color="#6b8e23">400,000 </font>Green standard army soldiers and
150,000 bannermen served on the Qing side. The Qing mobilised 213 Han
Chinese banner companies and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu
banners during the rebellion. In addition to 200,000 bannermen,
400,000 soldiers of the Green Beret Army were deployed against the
three feudal states.</p>

several military campaigns against <font color="#a9a9a9">the</font><font color="#dcdcdc">

Kangxi Emperor succeeded in expelling Galdan's invading forces from

Galdan was eventually killed <font color="#2f4f4f">in the
Dzungar-Qing War</font>. In <font color="#556b2f">1683, the </font>Qing

of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from Dutch colonists as a base
against the Qing<font color="#556b2f">.</font> Zheng Keshuang was
given the title &quot;Duke Haicheng&quot; (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">海澄公</font>)
and was admitted to the Red Corps of the Eight Guilds of the Han
Chinese Republic when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had
followed Koxinga to Taiwan between 1661 and 1662, including Prince
Zhu Shugui of Ningjing and Prince Zhu Honghuan (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">朱弘桓</font>),
son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. In
1683, the Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living in Taiwan back
to mainland China, where they spent the rest of their lives in exile,
as their lives were spared from execution. The victory in Taiwan
freed the Kangxi troops to fight from Albazin, the <font color="#6b8e23">Russian
</font>Empire's furthest eastern outpost. Zheng's former soldiers in
Taiwan, such as the Rattan Shield armies, were also taken into the
Eight League, and the Qing used them against the Russian Cossacks in
Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nertshinsk was China's first formal
treaty with a European power, and kept the border peaceful for nearly
two centuries. After Galdan's death, his successors, as adherents of
Tibetan Buddhism, tried to control the election of the next Dalai
Lama. Kangxi sent two armies to the Tibetan capital Lhasa and
installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.</p>

on the throne was because Yongzheng and his confidant Keduo Long
tampered with the contents of Kangxi's will on the night of Kangxi's
death), there is little evidence to support the accusation. In fact,
his father had confided in him on sensitive political issues and
discussed state policy with him. When Yongzheng came to power <font color="#2f4f4f">at
the age of 45</font>, he knew the urgency of the problems that had
accumulated in his father's last years and did not need guidance in
the use of power. In the words of one recent historian, he was

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">He was moving fast. First, he
promoted Confucian orthodoxy, overturning what his father considered
a lax line by intervening in unorthodox sects and beheading <font color="#a9a9a9">an
anti-Mansun writer whom </font>his father had pardoned. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1723
</font>he banned <font color="#2f4f4f">Christianity </font>and
expelled Christian missionaries, although some were allowed to stay
in the capital. Next, he took control of the government. He expanded
the system of palace memorials devised by his father, which brought
honest and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the
throne without being hampered by bureaucracy, and created a small
Grand Council of personal advisers, which eventually grew into a de
facto cabinet of the emperor for the rest of the dynasty. He
cunningly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials
who depended on his protection. When Yongzheng began to realise that
the economic crisis was even greater than he had thought, he
abandoned his father's lenient approach to the local landowning class
and launched a campaign to force <font color="#556b2f">the collection
of land taxes</font>. The increased revenue was to be used for
'honest money' among local officials, as well as for local
irrigation, schools, roads and charity. While these reforms were
effective in the north, there were long-established networks of
officials and landowners in the south and in the Yangzi Valley, where
Kangxi had courted the elite. Yongzheng sent experienced Manchu
commissioners to penetrate the thicket of fake land registers and
coded account books, but they were met with trickery, passivity and
even violence. The tax crisis continued.</p>

epidemics, but <font color="#a9a9a9">prosperity and internal

exhausted, forcing peasants to work on ever smaller and more

state of the country, saying: 'The population continues to grow, but
the land does not'. The only remaining part of the empire with arable
farmland was <font color="#6b8e23">Manchuria</font>, where the
provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang had been walled off as Manchu
homeland. For the first time, the emperor decreed that the settlement
of Han Chinese civilians was prohibited. The Qing forbade Mongols
from crossing the borders of their bans, even into other Mongol bans,
and from moving into the neid (the 18 provinces of the Han Chinese),
and if they crossed the neid, they were severely punished to keep the

reclaimed by Han Chinese squatters and other Han who rented land from
Manchu landowners. Despite the official Han Chinese ban on settling
Manchu and Mongolian lands, in the 1700s the Qing decided to settle
Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine,
floods and drought in <font color="#a9a9a9">Manchuria and Inner
Mongolia. </font>By the 1780s, Han Chinese were cultivating 500 000
hectares in Manchuria and <font color="#dcdcdc">tens of thousands of
hectares </font>in Inner Mongolia. Qianlong allowed drought-stricken
Han Chinese peasants to move to Manchuria, although he issued orders
between 1740 and 1776 to ban them. Chinese tenant farmers leased or
even claimed ownership of <font color="#2f4f4f">land in the </font>region's
<font color="#2f4f4f">'imperial estates' and Manchu banerais</font>.
In addition to the migration of Han Chinese to the Liao area in
southern Manchuria, the path connecting Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling,
Changchun, Hulun and Ninggut was settled under the <font color="#556b2f">Qianlong
</font>emperor, and Han Chinese were in the majority in Manchurian
urban areas by 1800. In order to increase the revenue of the Imperial
Treasury, the Qing Empire sold lands along the Sungar River,
previously only belonging to the Manchus, <font color="#6b8e23">to
the Han Chinese at the </font>beginning of the Daoguang Emperor's
reign, and the Han Chinese, according to Abbe Huci, filled most of
Manchuria's cities by the 1840s.</p>

silver. The Daoguang emperor, concerned both about the outflow of

rebellion </font>in the mid-19th century was the first major example

became king, claiming to have frequent visions of God and to be the
brother of Jesus Christ. Slavery, concubinage, arranged marriages,
opium burning, foot binding, judicial torture and idol worship were
banned. However, success and the authority and power that followed
led to internal strife, defections and corruption. In addition, the
Qing imperial army had been assisted by British and French troops
equipped with modern weapons. It was not until 1864 that the Qing
armies, under the leadership of Zeng Guofan, succeeded in crushing
the rebellion. Not only did the rebellion pose the most serious
threat to the Qing rulers, it was also 'the bloodiest civil war
ever'. During its fourteen years from 1850 to 1864, between 20 and 30
million people died. After the outbreak of this rebellion, China's
Muslim and Miao peoples also rebelled against the Qing dynasty,
notably the Dungan Rebellion (1862-77) in the north-west and the
Panthay Rebellion (1856-1873) in Yunnan.</p>

it was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed
wherever they wanted to go....... In the Arrow War <font color="#2f4f4f">(1856-60</font>),
the Chinese had no way of preventing the Anglo-French expedition of
1860 from sailing <font color="#556b2f">into Zhilin Bay </font>and
landing as close to Peking as possible. At the same time, new but not
quite modern Chinese armies suppressed mid-century rebellions,
tricked Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed borders in
Central Asia, and defeated French troops on land in the Sino-French
War (1884-85). But the defeat of the navy and the consequent threat

</font>Cixi also died. Rumour had it that he or Yuan Shikai ordered
trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy almost
a century later confirmed that the Emperor's body contained lethal
levels of arsenic. Puyi, Zaifeng's eldest son, <font color="#2f4f4f">Prince
Chun </font>and nephew of the childless Guangxu Emperor, was
appointed successor <font color="#556b2f">at the age of two</font>,
leaving Zaifeng in power. This was followed by the removal of General
Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911,
Zaifeng set up a cabinet with two deputy prime ministers.
Nevertheless, this cabinet was also known to contemporaries as the
'Royal Cabinet', as five of the thirteen members of the cabinet were
members of the imperial family or relatives of Aisin Gioro. This
brought with it a range of negative opinions from senior officials
such as Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang uprising of 10 October <font color="#6b8e23">1911
</font>led to the establishment of a new central government, the
Republic of China, in Nanjing, under the interim leadership of Sun
Yat-sen. Many provinces soon began to 'break away' from Qing rule.
When the Qing government saw the desperate situation developing, it
returned Yuan Shikai to military rule. He took command of his Beiyang
army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After
taking over as prime minister and assembling his own cabinet, Yuan
Shikai went so far as to ask for Zaifeng's dismissal from the
regency. This removal was later carried out on the instructions of
the Empress Dowager Longyu.</p>

Shunzhi Emperor died and his son, the Kangxi Emperor, took office.
The department's original purpose was to manage the internal affairs
of the imperial family and the inner palace (in these functions it
largely replaced the eunuchs), but it also played an important role
in Qing relations with Tibet and Mongolia, trading (<font color="#dcdcdc">jade,
ginseng, salt, furs</font>, etc.), running textile factories in <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Jiangnan region </font>and even publishing books. Relations with salt
chiefs and salt merchants, such as those in Yangzhou, were
particularly lucrative, especially as they were direct and did not
pass through absorbing layers of bureaucracy. The department employed
booi[o] or &quot;slave servants&quot; from the three upper banners.
In the 19th century, it administered at least 56 sub-offices.</p>

eighteen provinces were also known as '<font color="#556b2f">China

Tibetan territory or interfere with Tibetan administration, and China
undertook not to allow any other foreign state to interfere with
Tibetan territory or internal administration. Similar to Xinjiang,
which was previously converted into a province, the Qing government
also converted Manchuria into three provinces in the early 1900s,
officially known as the &quot;Three Northeastern Provinces&quot;, and
established the office of Viceroy of the Three Northeastern Provinces
to oversee these provinces, bringing the total number of regional

Yurchen society across petty clan lines. There were eight flags in
all, separated by <font color="#dcdcdc">colour</font>. The yellow,
amber and white flags were known as the '<font color="#2f4f4f">three
upper flags</font>' and were under the direct command of the emperor.
Only the <font color="#556b2f">mantas</font> of the three upper
banners and selected Han Chinese who had passed the highest level of
military examinations could serve as the emperor's personal
bodyguards. The remaining banners were known as the '<font color="#6b8e23">five
lower banners</font>'. They were commanded by hereditary Manchu
princes descended from Nurhach's immediate family, informally known
as the 'Ironclad princes'. Together they formed the ruling council of
the Manchus and the supreme command of the army. Nurhach's son Hong
Taiji expanded the system to include the mirrored Mongol and Han
districts. After the capture of Beijing in 1644, the relatively small
flag armies were further supplemented by the Green Flag Army,
composed of Ming troops who had surrendered to the Qing, which
eventually grew to three times the size of the flag armies. They
retained their Ming-era organisation and were led by a mixture of
Banner and Green Flag officers.</p>

<font color="#dcdcdc">according to </font><font color="#a9a9a9">ethnic
groups</font>, <font color="#dcdcdc">Manchu and Mongol</font>, but
also included non-Manchu servants registered in the households of
their Manchu masters. In the years preceding the conquest, the number
of Han Chinese under Manchu rule increased, leading Hong Taiji to
establish the Eight Han Banners (zh), and by the time of the Qing
coup in Beijing, their numbers were growing rapidly. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Han
banners </font>enjoyed high status and power in the early Qing
period, especially in the immediate post-conquest period during the
reigns of Shunzhi and Kangxi, when they held the posts of
governor-generals and governors throughout China at the expense of
both the Manchu banners and Han civilians. The Han also dominated the
banners in numbers until the mid-1700s. European visitors to Beijing
called them <font color="#556b2f">'Tartar Chinese' or 'Tartar
Chinese'</font>. <font color="#6b8e23">During Qianlong's reign, </font>the
Qianlong emperor, concerned about preserving Manchu identity,
re-emphasised Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language and culture in the
eight banners and began to mass expulsion of Han bannermen from the
eight banners, either by asking them to voluntarily resign from the
banner list or by removing their names from the banner. This resulted
in the Han majority becoming the Manchu majority in the banner
system, and the former Han bannermen garrisons in southern China,
such as Fuzhou, Zhenjiang and Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu
bannermen in the purge that began in 1754. The replacement by
Qianlong had the greatest impact on Han bannermen garrisons stationed
in the provinces, while it had less impact on Han bannermen stationed
in Beijing, leaving a larger proportion of the remaining Han
bannermen in Beijing than in the provinces. The Han bannermen's
position deteriorated from then on, with Manchu bannermen gaining
higher status. The number of Han bannermen was 75% in 1648 during the
Shunzhi reign, 72% in 1723 during the Yongzheng reign, but it fell to
43% in 1796 in the first year of the Jiaqing reign, which was after
the Qianlong purges. The purge was known as the dispersal of the Han
(zh). Qianlong directed most of his anger at those Han putschists
descended from defectors who joined the Qing after the Qing had
passed through the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, regarding
their ancestors as Ming traitors and therefore untrustworthy, while
retaining Han bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing
before 1644 in Liaodong and marched through the Shanhai Pass, also
known as &quot;Dragon Followers through the Pass&quot; (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">從龍入關</font>;

culminating in the loss of the regional capital <font color="#dcdcdc">Nanjing
in </font>1853. Shortly afterwards, the Taiping expedition pushed
north to the suburb of Tianjin, the imperial heartland. In
desperation, the Qing court ordered a Chinese official, Zeng Guofan,
to organise the regional and village militias into a makeshift army
called the Tuanlian. <font color="#2f4f4f">Zeng </font>Guofan's
strategy was to rely on the local nobility to assemble a new kind of
military organisation from the provinces directly threatened by the
Taiping rebels. These new forces became known <font color="#556b2f">as
the Xiang Army</font>, named after the <font color="#6b8e23">Hunan
region where they were assembled</font>. The Xiang Army was a
combination of local militias and the standing army. It received
professional training, but its costs were paid from regional coffers
and from funds that its commanders - mostly members of the Chinese
nobility - were able to raise. The Xiang Army and its successor, the
Huai Army, created by Zeng Guofan's colleague and apprentice Li
Hongzhang, were collectively called the 'Yong Ying' (brave camp).</p>

doctrine was based on neo-Confucian ideas of binding troops to

they had been raised. Zeng Guofan's original intention for Xiang's
army was simply to <font color="#2f4f4f">exterminate the Taiping

in Chinese history in terms of numbers, duration and routine. Indeed,
the Qing government did much more to encourage mobility than to
discourage it. Migration took many forms, but it can be divided into
two types: <font color="#2f4f4f">permanent migration for resettlement
and resettlement, which the Party considered (at least in theory) to
be temporary residence</font>. The parties to the latter option
included the empire's increasingly large and mobile artisan
population and its densely overlapping diaspora of merchant groups of
local origin. It would also involve the systematic migration of Qing
subjects abroad, mainly to Southeast Asia, in search of trade and
other economic opportunities.</p>

belonged to the first category, and were described as <font color="#2f4f4f">liangmin</font>,
a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to jianmin, meaning mean
(or despicable) people. The Qing law explicitly stated that the
traditional four occupational groups of scholars, farmers, craftsmen
and merchants were 'good', i.e. they had the status of commoners. On
the other hand, slaves or slave-servants, entertainers (including
prostitutes and actors) and low-level employees of government

legally inferior to ordinary people and were treated unequally, and
were forbidden to take part in imperial examinations.</p>

not to find gold or precious stones in El Salvador, as they had found
in other countries such as Guatemala or Mexico, but when they learned
of El Salvador's fertile land, they tried to conquer it. The Spanish
were opposed militarily by indigenous Mesoamerican warriors,
including the Pipil princes Atonal and Atlacatl in central El
Salvador and the Lenca princess Antu Silan Ulap in eastern El
Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as <font color="#556b2f">barbaric
invaders.</font> After fierce fighting, the Pipils successfully
defeated the Spanish army led by Pedro de Alvarado and their Mexican
Indian allies (tlaxcalat) and sent them back to Guatemala. After many
more attacks, the Spanish managed to conquer Cuzcatlan, after the
army was reinforced by Guatemalan Indian allies. After further
invasions, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually
the Spaniards intermarried with the Pipil and Lenca women, and the
result was a mestizo population that became the majority of the
Salvadoran people. Today, many Pipil and other indigenous peoples
live in many of El Salvador's small towns, such as Izalco,

their origin, i.e. it also includes the indigenous languages of
ethnic groups that are not indigenous to the region. The National
Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples thus recognises
the Kickapoo language of migrants from the United States and the

other large European cities, there were guilds of dyers specialising
in red dye. The rubia plant was the <font color="#2f4f4f">most common
dye</font>, producing an orange-red or brick-red colour used to dye
the clothes of merchants and craftsmen. For the <font color="#556b2f">rich,
the dye used was </font>kermes, made from a small scale insect that
ate the branches and leaves of oak trees. For those with even more
money, <font color="#6b8e23">Polish cochineal</font>, also known as
<font color="#a0522d">Kermes vermilio </font>or 'St John's blood',
was used, made from a related insect, <font color="#228b22">Margodes
polonicus.</font> It was a more vivid red colour than ordinary
kermes. The finest and most expensive red variety of insect was the
Armenian kermes (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz),
which was <font color="#191970">made by collecting and crushing </font><font color="#8b0000">the
Porphyophora hamelii </font>insect, which lived on the roots and
stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye dealers of Venice
imported and sold all these products and also produced their own
colour, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive
and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which
brightened the colour.</p>

treasure besides silver and gold: they had a small indoor flower, a
parasitic scale insect that lives on cactus plants and, when dried
and crushed, turned a magnificent red. Cultivated in Mexico, it was
closely related to European cream, but unlike European cream, it
could be harvested <font color="#6b8e23">several times a year </font>and
was ten times stronger than Polish cream. It worked particularly well
on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. In <font color="#a0522d">1523,

of the most common colours used on national flags. Red has similar
meanings in different countries: the blood of the defenders of their
country, sacrifice and courage, the sun and the hope and warmth it
brings, and the sacrifice of <font color="#dcdcdc">Christ's blood </font>(in
some historically Christian nations) are some examples. Red is the
colour of the flags of many countries that were once part of the
former British Empire. The British flag is <font color="#2f4f4f">red,
white and blue</font>; it bears the <font color="#556b2f">cross of St
George, </font><font color="#6b8e23">patron saint of England, </font>and
the cross of St Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both red on white.
The flag of the United States has the British colours, the French
tricolour has red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other
countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Fiji have a small insert
of the British flag to commemorate their links with the country. Many
of Spain's former colonies, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba,
Puerto Rico, Peru and Venezuela, also have <font color="#a0522d">red

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Greco-Roman mosaic had two main
techniques: <font color="#a9a9a9">opus vermiculatum </font>used small
cubes, usually no larger than 4 mm, and was made in workshops into
relatively small panels that were transported to the site glued to a
temporary support. The tiny tesserae allowed for <font color="#dcdcdc">very
fine detail </font>and approached the illusionism of painting. The
small panels, called <font color="#2f4f4f">emblemata, were </font>often
placed on walls or as highlights of larger floor mosaics in rougher
works. A common technique was <font color="#556b2f">opus </font>tessellatum,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The last great period of Roman
mosaic art was <font color="#a9a9a9">in the 1200s and 1300s</font>,
when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style, free from the
strict rules of the Eastern tradition and with more realistic
depictions of figures in space. Famous works from this period include
the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente, the façade of
Santa Maria in <font color="#dcdcdc">Trastevere </font>and San Paolo
fuori le Mura. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere
(1140) depicts <font color="#2f4f4f">Christ and Mary </font>sitting
side by side on a heavenly throne, the first example of this
iconographic system. A similar mosaic, The Coronation of the Virgin
Mary, adorns the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore. It is a work by Jacopo
Torriti dating from 1295. The mosaics by Torriti and Jacopo da
Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano, dating from
1288-94, were thoroughly restored <font color="#556b2f">in 1884.</font>
The mosaic in the apse of San Crisogono is by Pietro Cavalli, the
greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. The six scenes of the
Life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also painted by
Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics have been praised for their
realistic depictions and efforts at perspective. Above the gate of
the church of San Tommaso in Formis, an interesting mosaic medallion
from <font color="#6b8e23">1210 shows </font>Christ seated between a

of the Arab Caliphate</font>. The mosque was built between 706 and
715, and the Caliph received 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine
emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly
Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics in the courtyard
depict a paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns
and villages in the background. There are no human figures in the
mosaics, which distinguishes them from otherwise similar contemporary
Byzantine works. The largest continuous section is preserved under
the western arcade of the courtyard and is called <font color="#556b2f">the
Barada panel </font>after the Barada River. The mosque is believed to
have contained the largest gold mosaic in the world, measuring over 4

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works
were mainly <font color="#a9a9a9">floor tiles that </font>decorated
the palaces of caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were

houses</font>, which were once common in the eastern Mediterranean.
The most spectacular example is <font color="#2f4f4f">the bath house
at the Palace of Hisham </font>in Palestine, built around 744. The
main image shows a large tree with a lion attacking a deer underneath
(right) and two deer grazing peacefully (left). The panel probably
depicts good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric
patterns have been preserved in the baths of an 8th century Umayyad
palace complex in Anjar, Lebanon. The luxurious desert residence of
Al-Walid II at Qasr al-Hallabat (in modern <font color="#556b2f">Jordan)
</font>was also decorated with floor mosaics, showing a high level of
technical skill. The best-preserved panel in Hallabat is divided by a
tree of life, flanked by 'good' animals on one side and 'bad' animals
on the other. Hallabat features vines, grapes, pomegranates, oryx,
wolves, rabbits, leopards, pairs of partridges, fish, oxen,
ostriches, hares, rams, goats, lions and a snake, among others. In
2000, excavations at Qastal, near Amman, revealed the earliest known
<font color="#6b8e23">Umayyad mosaics </font>from what is now Jordan,
probably dating from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan
(685-705). The mosaics cover much of the floor of the elaborately
decorated building, which probably served as the palace of the local
governor. The Qastal mosaics feature geometric patterns, trees,
animals, fruits and rosettes. Apart from the open courtyard, the
entrance and the stairs, the entire floor of the palace was covered

Tiles are attached <font color="#dcdcdc">face down on backing paper
</font>with adhesive and later transferred to walls, floors or craft
projects. This method is most useful for very large projects because
it <font color="#2f4f4f">gives the contractor time to shape </font>the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The double indirect method can be
used when it is important that the <font color="#a9a9a9">work is seen
</font>during the creative process as it is when it is finished. The
tesserae are placed face up on a substrate (often adhesive paper,
<font color="#dcdcdc">sticky plastic </font>or soft lime or putty) as
they will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a
similar medium is placed on top. The piece is then inverted, the
original base material is carefully removed and the piece is
installed as in the indirect method described above. Compared to the
indirect method, this is a complex system and requires great skill on
the part of the user to avoid damaging the work. Its main advantage
is that the user has <font color="#2f4f4f">direct control over the
outcome of the work, which is </font>important when, for example, a

of inquiry into natural processes that </font>had begun to emerge as
early as the 13th century. Some scholars believe that these works
represented one of the most important documentary discoveries in
Western intellectual history. <font color="#556b2f">Richard Dales</font>,
for example, calls the discovery of Aristotle's works &quot;a turning
point in the history of <font color="#6b8e23">Western thought</font>&quot;.
The re-emergence of Aristotle was the catalyst for a <font color="#a0522d">community
of scholars who </font>communicated mainly <font color="#228b22">in
Latin, a </font>process and practice that sought to reconcile the
ideas of Greek antiquity, particularly those related to the
understanding of nature, with those of the Church. The efforts of
this '<font color="#191970">scholasticism' </font>focused on applying
Aristotelian logic and ideas about natural processes to biblical
passages and attempting to prove the viability of these passages
through <font color="#8b0000">reason</font>. This became the primary
task of lecturers and the expectation of students.</p>

culture </font>developed differently in northern Europe than in the
south, although northern (mainly Germany, France and the UK) and
southern (mainly Italy) universities had many features in common. The
language of the university was <font color="#dcdcdc">Latin, which </font>was
used for all texts, lectures, debates and exams. <font color="#2f4f4f">Professors
</font>lectured on Aristotle's books on logic, natural philosophy and
metaphysics, while <font color="#556b2f">in medicine </font>the books
of Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna were used. Apart from these
similarities, there were major differences between North and South,
mainly in terms of subjects. Italian universities focused on law and
medicine, while northern universities concentrated on the <font color="#6b8e23">arts
and theology.</font> There were clear differences in the quality of
teaching in these disciplines, which coincided with their priorities,
so scholars travelled north or south according to their interests and
means. There were also differences in the types of degrees awarded by
these universities. English, French and German universities generally
awarded <font color="#a0522d">bachelor's degrees, with the </font>exception
of theology, where <font color="#228b22">doctorates </font>were more
common. Italian universities mainly awarded doctorates. The
difference may be due to what the graduates intended to do after
graduation - in the North, the focus was usually on teaching posts,
while <font color="#191970">in the South students often moved into
professional posts.</font> The structure of northern universities was
generally modelled on the faculty management system developed at the
University of Paris. Southern universities were usually modelled on
the student-run model started at <font color="#8b0000">the University
of Bologna.</font> Among the southern universities, a distinction was
also noted between the universities of northern Italy, which followed
the Bologna model as a 'self-regulating, independent community of
scholars', and the universities of southern Italy and Iberia, which
were 'established by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of
the government'.</p>

at the end of the Middle Ages. This figure does not include the many
universities that disappeared or merged with other universities
during this period. It should be noted that the identification of a
university was not necessarily self-evident in the early modern
period, as the term was used for an increasing number of
institutions. In fact, the term 'university' was not always used to
designate an institution of higher education. In Mediterranean
countries, the term studium generale was still often used, while
'academy' was common in northern European countries.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Early modern
universities </font>initially continued <font color="#2f4f4f">the
curricula and research of the Middle Ages</font><font color="#556b2f">:
</font>natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics,
astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle
dominated the entire curriculum, while medicine also depended on
<font color="#a0522d">Galen and Arabic scholarship.</font> The role
of humanism in changing this situation cannot be underestimated. When
the professors of humanities joined the university faculty, they
began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric into studia
humanitatis. The <font color="#228b22">humanities </font>professors
focused on the students' ability to write and speak with elegance, to
translate and interpret classical texts and to lead a life of
respectability. Their humanistic approaches to learning and their
linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as their
ideology of defending the ultimate meaning of these texts, influenced
other scholars at the university. Professors of <font color="#191970">medicine</font>,
such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop, often
received a humanistic education and taught from a humanistic
perspective, and translated important ancient medical texts. The
critical thinking transmitted by humanism was essential for the
transformation of universities and scholarship. Andreas Vesalius, for
example, received a humanist education before translating Galen,
whose ideas he verified through his own autopsies. In law, <font color="#8b0000">Andreas
Alciatus </font>brought <font color="#483d8b">a humanist perspective
to </font>the Corpus Juris, and the humanist writings of Jacques
Cujas were crucial to his reputation as a jurist. Philipp Melanchthon
cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide to
reconnecting theology back to the original texts, which was important
for the reform of Protestant universities. Galileo Galilei, who
taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua, and Martin Luther, who
taught at the University of Wittenberg (as did Melanchthon), also
received a humanities education. The task of <font color="#3cb371">the
humanists </font>was to slowly permeate the university; to increase
the presence of humanists in professorships and chairs, in curricula
and textbooks, so that published works would demonstrate the humanist
ideal of science and scholarship.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although the original focus of
<font color="#a9a9a9">humanities </font>scholars at the university
was to discover, present and bring ancient texts and languages to the
university, and to disseminate the ideas of these texts to society at
large, their impact was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence
of classical texts brought with it new ideas and led to a more
creative university atmosphere (as evidenced by the remarkable list
of scholars above). The focus on knowledge of the self, the human
being, directly influenced new forms of science and teaching, and was
the basis of what is commonly called the <font color="#dcdcdc">humanities.
</font>This <font color="#2f4f4f">orientation towards knowledge </font>took
the form not only of translating and disseminating ancient texts, but
also of adapting and extending them. Vesalius, for example, was an
absolute champion of the use of <font color="#556b2f">Galena, </font>but
he also revitalised this text through experimentation, controversy
and further research. The dissemination of these texts, especially
within universities, was greatly facilitated by the emergence of the
<font color="#6b8e23">printing press </font>and the beginning of the
vernacular, which made it possible to print relatively large texts at
reasonable prices.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Other historians find it
inconsistent that a place where a large number of scientists who
contributed to the scientific revolution received their training
should also be a place that hinders their research and the progress
of science. In fact, <font color="#a9a9a9">more than 80% of the
</font>European scientists from 1450-1650 included in the Dictionary
of Scientific Biography had a university education, and around 45% of
them held university posts. The academic foundations that remained
from the Middle Ages were solid and provided an environment conducive
to considerable growth and development. Universities were <font color="#dcdcdc">very
reluctant to </font>give up the symmetry and comprehensiveness
offered by the Aristotelian system, which was an effective single
system for understanding and interpreting the world. However,
university professors, at least in the natural sciences, continued to
exercise some autonomy in their choice of epistemological criteria
and methods. For example, Melanchthon and his students <font color="#2f4f4f">at
the University of Wittenberg </font>were instrumental in
incorporating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical
discourse and teaching. Another example was the brief but relatively
rapid adoption of <font color="#556b2f">Cartesian </font>epistemology
and methodology in European universities and the associated debates
that led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems and
demonstrated openness to change. There are many examples that refute
the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. While
universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and
methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas, it
helped to give <font color="#6b8e23">legitimacy and respect </font>and
supported scientific change by providing a stable environment for
teaching and material resources.</p>

BC), </font>the same men who were elected as public officials could
also serve as augurs and popes. Priests married, had families and led
politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus
before being elected consul. The Augurs read the will of the gods and
oversaw the marking of boundaries as a reflection of the universal
order, and thus Roman expansionism was accepted as divine destiny.

practical and contractual, based on the principle of do ut des, &quot;I

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As the Romans expanded their
dominance throughout the Mediterranean, their policy was generally <font color="#a9a9a9">to
embrace the </font>deities and cults of other peoples rather than
trying to eradicate them, believing that <font color="#dcdcdc">the
preservation of traditions </font>would contribute to social
stability. One way in which Rome assimilated diverse peoples was to
support their <font color="#2f4f4f">religious heritage </font>by
building temples to local gods, framing their theology within the
hierarchy of Roman religion. Writings throughout the empire record
the parallel worship of local and Roman deities, including
initiations of Romans to local gods. By the peak years of the empire,
Rome was worshipping numerous international deities that had spread
to the <font color="#556b2f">outermost provinces, </font>including
Cybele, Isis, Epona and the sun-monster gods such as Mithras and Sol
Invictus, who were found as far north as Roman Britain. Since the
Romans were never obliged to worship only one god or only one cult,
religious <font color="#6b8e23">tolerance </font>was not a problem in
the sense that it was for competing monotheistic systems. The
monotheistic strictness of Judaism created difficulties for Roman
politics, sometimes leading to compromises and the granting of
specific exceptions, but sometimes also to persistent conflicts.
Religious disputes contributed, for example, to the first
Jewish-Roman war and the Bar Kokhba revolt.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the political, social and
religious instability of the late Republic, several versions of a
semi-formal, structured pantheon were developed. <font color="#a9a9a9">Jupiter,
the </font>most powerful of all the gods and 'the source of the
favourable words on which the city's relationship with the gods was
based', consistently personified <font color="#dcdcdc">the divine

external relations. In the Archaic and early Republican periods, he
shared his temple, some aspects of the cult and several divine
attributes with <font color="#2f4f4f">Mars and Quirinus</font>, who
were later replaced by Juno and Minerva. The conceptual tendency
towards triads may refer to the later agricultural or plebeian triad
of Ceres, Liber and Libera, as well as to some of the triple deity
groupings that complemented the imperial cult. Other major and minor
deities may have been single, paired or linked to each other
afterwards through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure.
These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are partly literary and
mythographic, partly philosophical creations and often of <font color="#556b2f">Greek

In Fasti, a long poem about the Roman holidays from January to June,
Ovid presents a unique survey of Roman antiquity, popular customs and
religious practices that are by turns imaginative, entertaining,
sublime and immoral; It is not a priestly narrative, even if the
speaker appears as a vatic or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of
description, imagination and poetic etymology, reflecting the broad
humour and burlesque spirit of venerable festivals such as
Saturnalia, Consualia and the March Ides of Anna Perenna, in which
Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as
completely incidental to the festivities of the Roman people.
However, the official calendars that survive from different times and
places also show flexibility in the exclusion or expansion of events,
indicating that there was no single static and <font color="#556b2f">authoritative

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">All sacrifices and offerings
required that they be accompanied by <font color="#a9a9a9">prayer in

&quot;sacrifice without prayer is considered <font color="#dcdcdc">useless

<font color="#2f4f4f">prayer </font>itself had an independent power.
The spoken word was therefore the single most effective religious
act, and knowledge of the <font color="#556b2f">correct verbal
formulae </font>was the key to effectiveness. Accurate naming was
vital to harness the desired powers of the deity invoked, hence the
abundance of cult epithets of Roman deities. The priest recited
public prayers (prex) on behalf of the community in a loud and clear
manner. Experts and professionals had to perform the public religious
ritual flawlessly; a mistake might require the activity, or even the
whole celebration, to be repeated from the beginning. The historian
Liivius tells of a case in which the judge presiding over a Latin
feast forgot to include in his prayer the 'Roman people' in the list
of beneficiaries; the feast had to be started again. Even a private
prayer by an individual was formulaic, a statement rather than <font color="#6b8e23">a

flamines dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus were traditionally
from patrician families. The twelve smaller flamines were each

purity limited the flamines; the Jupiter flamines in particular had
virtually no concomitant capacity for political or military careers.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">The colleges
</font>appointed the public priests. Once elected, the priest had
permanent religious authority from an eternal deity, granting him
<font color="#dcdcdc">lifelong </font>influence, privileges and
immunity. Therefore, civil and religious <font color="#2f4f4f">law
</font>limited the number and type of religious offices allowed for
an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and
traditional; it informed political decisions, could overrule them and
was difficult to use for personal gain. The priesthood was an
<font color="#556b2f">expensive </font>honour: according to
traditional Roman practice, the priest was not paid. Cult offerings
were the property of the deity, and the priest had to offer the cult
regardless of lack of public funding - this could mean supporting the
maintenance of acolytes and all other cult activities from personal
funds. For those who had achieved their goals in the Cursus honorum,
permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime of
service in the military or political life, or preferably both: it was
a particularly honourable and active form of retirement, fulfilling
an essential public function. For a freedman or slave, promotion to
the Compitalia sevir provided a high local profile and opportunities
in local politics and thus in business. In the imperial period, the
priesthood of the imperial cult offered the provincial elite full
<font color="#6b8e23">Roman citizenship </font>and public visibility
after one year in religious office; it was effectively the first
stage in the provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same function of
imperial cult was performed by the Order of Arval, an obscure
Republican priesthood once devoted to several gods, which Augustus
adopted as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals prayed and
sacrificed to the gods of the Roman state in various temples for the
continued prosperity of the imperial family on their birthdays, on
their accession anniversaries and to mark exceptional events such as
the defeat of a conspiracy or rebellion. On 3 January each year, they
consecrated the annual pledges and performed all the sacrifices
promised the previous year, provided the gods had kept the imperial
family safe during the contract period.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Public worship took place <font color="#a9a9a9">on
sacred ground, </font>ritually marked by the <font color="#dcdcdc">augur</font>.
The original meaning of the Latin word templum was this <font color="#2f4f4f">sacred
space, </font>and only later did it refer to a building. Rome itself
was an inherently sacred space; its ancient boundary (pomerium) had
been marked by <font color="#556b2f">Romulus </font>himself with oxen
and plough; the area within it was the secular home and sanctuary of
the state gods. In Rome, the Via Sacra (sacred road) and the pomerium
seem to have been the main references for the establishment of the
augural temple. Magistrates sought the divine opinion on proposed
official acts through the augur, who read the <font color="#6b8e23">divine
will </font>within the temple on the basis of observations made
before, during and after the sacrifice. Divine disapproval could
result from an inappropriate sacrifice, erroneous rites (vitium) or
an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given,
the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were
seen, consult with his augural colleagues or abandon the project.
Magistrates could use their augur's right (ius augurum) to suspend
and annul the legal process, but they had to base their decision on
the augur's findings and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this
made the augur the most powerful authority in the late empire. In his
time (mid-1st century BC), the augur was overseen by a college of
pontifices, whose powers were increasingly linked to the jurisdiction
of the cursus honorum.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Haruspys were also used in public

ethnically 'outsider' religious profession, separate from the
internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy of Rome, which was
necessary but never quite respectable. In the mid to late republic,
the reformist Gaius Gracchus, the populist politician-general Gaius
Marius and his opponents Sulla and the 'infamous Verres' justified
their very different policies with divinely inspired pronouncements
from private <font color="#556b2f">soothsayers. The </font>Senate and

one point in the latter years of the Republic, the Senate decreed
that Roman sons of noble birth should be sent to Etruria for
haruspice training and divination. Because they had independent
means, they were better motivated to maintain a pure, religious
practice in the public interest. The motives of private haruspices -
especially women - and their clients were officially suspected: this

is perfectly acceptable to the gods. In a prayer recorded by Livy,
Decius surrenders himself and the enemy to Dii Manes and Tellus,
rushes alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his
act purifies the sacrificial victim. If Decius had not died, his

Senate appointed <font color="#556b2f">Camillus </font>dictator to

Concordia.</font> Religious calendars and laws were finally
published. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacred status and
veto power in legislative debates. In principle, the augural and
pontifical collegia were now open to the plebeians. In reality, the
patrician and, to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility ruled the

offered clear political and practical advantages, especially for the

vote of the Senate.</font> As a divus, he could receive the same
honours as any other state deity - the serving of wine, garlands,
incense, hymns and sacrificial offerings at games and festivals. What
he did in return for these favours is not known, but literary
evidence and the later adoption of divus as a Christian saint suggest
that he was a heavenly intercessor. The official cult of a living
emperor in Rome was directed at his genius; few refused this honour,
and there is no evidence that any emperor received more. In the
crises preceding the reign, the titles and honours of the emperor
increased and reached their peak under Diocletian. The emperors

During the various imperial crises of the 3rd century,
'contemporaries tended to interpret any crisis in religious terms',
regardless of whether they were loyal to particular practices or
belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional support from the
powerless, who seemed to have no religious interest in the welfare of
the Roman state, and therefore threatened its existence. The majority
of the Roman elite continued to follow various forms of Hellenistic
monism; in particular, Neo-Platonism embodied a sense of wonder and
asceticism in the traditional Greco-Roman cult. Christians saw these
<font color="#6b8e23">godless practices as </font>the primary cause
of economic and political crisis.</p>

Decius' edict invoked the fact that any common mos maiores could

cults; no ancestral gods were mentioned by name. Fulfilling the

calling on Christians to sacrifice to <font color="#2f4f4f">the

Christians were a <font color="#556b2f">threat to </font>the imperial
system - not yet at its core, but close to it, among the Roman
horsemen and senators. Christian apologists interpreted his shameful
imprisonment and death as divine judgment. The next forty years were
peaceful; the Christian Church <font color="#6b8e23">grew stronger
</font>and its literature and theology gained greater social and
intellectual prominence, due in part to its own quest for political
tolerance and theological consistency. Origen discussed theological
issues with the traditionalist elite within a common neo-Platonist
framework - he had written to Decius' predecessor Philip of Arabia
along similar lines - and Hippolytus acknowledged the 'pagan' basis
of Christian heresies. The Christian churches were divided; Paul of
Samosata, bishop of Antioch, was excommunicated at the Synod of 268
'for dogmatic reasons - his doctrine of the human nature of Christ
was rejected - and for his lifestyle, which resembled that of his
brethren in the ways of the administrative elite'. The reasons for
his ouster were widely disseminated among the churches. Meanwhile,
Aurelian (270-75) appealed to the concordia militum of his soldiers,
stabilized the empire and its borders, and successfully established
an official, Hellenistic, unified cult of the Palmyrene Sol Invictus
on the Roman Campus Martius.</p>

ideology of mutual tolerance. Constantine had triumphed under the
sign of Christ: Christianity was thus <font color="#dcdcdc">officially
</font>accepted <font color="#2f4f4f">alongside the traditional
religions</font>, and Constantine, from his new eastern capital,
could be seen as representing the religious interests of both
Christians and Hellenes. He may have officially stopped - or sought
to stop - the blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors, but
his imperial iconography and court ceremonies overtook Diocletian in
the superhuman elevation of the imperial hierarchy. His later direct
intervention in the affairs of the Church proved to be a political
masterpiece. Constantine united the empire <font color="#556b2f">as

larger than those achievable on television. While YouTube's

</font>2013, Google introduced a <font color="#dcdcdc">new commenting
system that </font>requires all YouTube users to have a Google+
account in order to comment on videos, making the commenting system
Google+-focused. The changes are largely an attempt to respond to
frequent criticism of the quality and tone of YouTube comments. They
give creators more power to moderate and <font color="#2f4f4f">block
</font>comments and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better
and <font color="#556b2f">more relevant conversations </font>appear
at the top. The new system restored the ability to include URLs in
comments, which had previously been removed due to abuse problems. In
response to this, YouTube co-founder <font color="#6b8e23">Jawed
Karim </font>posted the question &quot;<font color="#a0522d">why the
fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?&quot;. </font>&quot;
on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.
The official YouTube ad received <font color="#228b22">20,097 </font>&quot;thumbs
down&quot; votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.
In Newsday's Silicon Island blog, Chase Melvin noted that &quot;<font color="#191970">Google+

YouTube's subscription-based <font color="#a9a9a9">Music Key </font>service,
the independent music industry organisation Worldwide Independent
Network claimed that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with
independent record labels that were &quot;undervalued&quot; compared
to other streaming services, and that YouTube <font color="#dcdcdc">was
blocking all music content from </font>labels that could not agree to
access the paid service. Robert Kyncl confirmed in a statement to the
Financial Times in June 2014 that <font color="#2f4f4f">YouTube
blocks content from labels that do not negotiate agreements for
access to the paid service </font><font color="#556b2f">&quot;to
ensure that all content on the platform complies with the new terms
and conditions</font>&quot;. He said that <font color="#6b8e23">90
per cent of </font>record labels had reached an <font color="#a0522d">agreement,
and continued: </font>&quot;While we wish we had a [100 per cent]
success rate, we recognise that this is unlikely to be an achievable
goal and therefore our duty to our users and the <font color="#228b22">music
industry is to launch an enhanced music experience</font>.&quot;
Later, the <font color="#191970">Financial Times </font>reported that
YouTube had reached an agreement with the Merlin Network - a trade
group representing more than <font color="#8b0000">20 000 </font>independent

conflicts in France and Germany. They included nonconformists such as
the Puritans, who were Protestant Christians fleeing <font color="#2f4f4f">religious
persecution </font>by the Anglican <font color="#556b2f">King of
England.</font> Despite their common background, the groups had
different views on religious tolerance. Some, such as Roger Williams

protection of <font color="#6b8e23">religious minorities </font>in
their colonies, while others, such as the Plymouth Colony and the
Massachusetts Bay Colony, had established <font color="#a0522d">churches.</font>
The Dutch colony of New Netherland established a Dutch Reformed
Church and banned all other religions, although compliance was rarely
enforced. Religious uniformity was sought partly for economic
reasons: the established church was responsible for alleviating
poverty, which put dissenting churches at a considerable
disadvantage.</p>

&quot;The law of love, peace, and liberty in states extends to Jews,

December 1657 by </font>a group of English citizens in America,
offended by the persecution of <font color="#6b8e23">Quakers </font>and
the religious policies of Peter Stuyvesant, governor of New
Netherland. Stuyvesant had, under the laws of the Dutch Republic,
officially banned the practice of any <font color="#a0522d">religion

signatories declared that they 'do not therefore wish in this case to
judge lest we be judged, nor to condemn lest we be condemned, but let
each man stand or fall before his own master'. Stuyvesant fined the
petitioners and threw them in prison until they withdrew. John Bowne,
however, allowed <font color="#228b22">the Quakers</font> to meet at
his home. Bowne was arrested, imprisoned and sent to the Netherlands
for trial; a Dutch court acquitted Bowne of the charges.</p>

Constitution, Madison argued that &quot;since religion is exempt from
the general power of society, the less can it be subject to the power
of the legislature.&quot; After Madison retired from the presidency,
he wrote of &quot;the complete separation of church and state.&quot;
&quot;'Strongly guarded as is the separation of religion and
government in the Constitution of the United States,' Madison wrote,
and he declared that 'the <font color="#6b8e23">practical distinction
</font>between religion and civil government is essential to the
purity of both, and is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United
States.'&quot; In a letter to Edward Livingston, Madison continued:
&quot;We teach the world the great truth that governments do better
without kings and nobles than with them. The merit is doubled by the
second doctrine, that religion flourishes in greater purity without
the aid of government than with it.&quot; Madison's original draft of
the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the states as well
as the federal government on the establishment of religion, but the

religious freedom encompassing all religions. In sum, citizens are

any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97
(<font color="#a9a9a9">1968)</font>, the Supreme Court addressed an
Arkansas statute that made it a crime &quot;to teach a theory or
doctrine that <font color="#2f4f4f">mankind has arisen or descended
from a lower animal kingdom</font><font color="#556b2f">&quot; </font>or
&quot;to adopt or use in any such educational institution a textbook
that teaches&quot; that theory in any school or university that
received public funds. A court opinion written by <font color="#6b8e23">Judge
Abe Fortas </font>found that the Arkansas law violated &quot;the
constitutional prohibition against state laws <font color="#228b22">establishing
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.</font>&quot; The
essential fact is that the Arkansas law selects a segment of
knowledge that it prohibits solely because it is deemed to be
inconsistent with a particular religious doctrine, i.e., a particular
interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious
group.&quot; Thus, the Arkansas law cannot conflict with an
interpretation by a particular religious group. The Court held that
the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from promoting any
religion and that &quot;[t]he State has no legitimate interest in
protecting any or all religions <font color="#191970">from views
repugnant to them</font>.&quot;

Protestants, and the key alliance between secularist and Protestant
churches in the public sector has collapsed. While mainline
Protestant denominations are more in favour of a strict separation of

is a &quot;<font color="#556b2f">kind of civic </font>religion&quot;
in the US, which includes a widely shared belief in a creator who
&quot;expects the best of us&quot;. Beyond that, individuals are free

in the 1500s. Lutheranism spread <font color="#a9a9a9">from Germany
</font>to neighbouring areas,[c] Denmark,[d] Norway,[e] Sweden,[f]
Finland,[g] Prussia,[h] Latvia,[i] Estonia,[j] and Iceland[k] as well

Germany and neighbouring areas,[l] Hungary,[m] the Netherlands,[n]

Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli and John Knox</font>. Arminianism[r] gained
adherents <font color="#2f4f4f">in the Netherlands and parts of
Germany. </font>In 1534, <font color="#556b2f">King Henry VIII </font>ended
all papal jurisdiction in England[s] after the Pope had not annulled
his marriage to Catherine of Aragon; this opened the door to the
Reformation, especially under the next Edward VI, through Thomas
Cranmer, Richard Hooker, Matthew Parker and other theologians.
Throughout continental Europe there were also reform efforts known as
the Radical Reformation - a response both to the corruption of the
Roman Catholic Church and to the expanding Reformation led by Luther
and many other reformers - which gave rise to Anabaptist, Moravian
and other pietistic movements. In later centuries, <font color="#6b8e23">Protestants

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the Reformation, the term was
hardly used outside German politics. The word evangelical
(<font color="#dcdcdc">evangelisch in </font>German), referring to
the gospel, was used much more broadly to refer to those involved in
the religious movement. Today, the word is still preferred for some
historic Protestant denominations, especially those in the
German-speaking area, such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch
means Protestant, and is distinct from the German word evangelikal,
which refers to churches shaped by evangelicalism. The English word
<font color="#2f4f4f">evangelical </font>usually refers to
evangelical Protestant churches and not to Protestantism as a whole.
It has its roots in <font color="#556b2f">the Puritans </font>in
England, where evangelicalism originated and from where it was then
brought to the United States. In German, the word reformatorisch is
used as an alternative to the word evangelisch, and is distinct from
the English Reformed (German: reformiert), which refers to the
churches shaped by the ideas of <font color="#6b8e23">John Calvin,
Huldrych Zwingli </font>and other Reformed theologians.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The use of phrases as summaries of
doctrine emerged over time during the Reformation, based on <font color="#a9a9a9">the
principle of sola scriptura </font>(according to the scriptures
alone). This idea includes <font color="#dcdcdc">four </font>key
doctrines from Scripture: its teaching is necessary for salvation
(<font color="#2f4f4f">necessity</font>); all doctrine necessary for
salvation comes from Scripture alone (sufficiency); everything taught
in Scripture is correct (<font color="#556b2f">inerrancy)</font>; and

truth from Scripture itself, though understanding is difficult, so
the means used to guide individual believers to correct teaching is

Hungary, Germany and elsewhere. After the expulsion of its bishop in
1526 and the failed attempt of William Farel, the reformer of Bern,
Calvin was asked to use the organisational skills he had acquired as
a law student to discipline the 'fallen city' of Geneva. His
ordinances of 1541 called for church affairs to be managed in
collaboration with the city council and consistory to bring morality
to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva Academy
in 1559, <font color="#2f4f4f">Geneva </font>became the unofficial
capital of the Protestant movement, offering refuge to Protestant
refugees from all over Europe and training them <font color="#556b2f">as
Calvinist </font>missionaries. The faith continued to spread after
Calvin's death in <font color="#6b8e23">1563.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Protestantism spread from Germany to
France, where Protestants were nicknamed <font color="#a9a9a9">Huguenots</font>.
Calvin continued his interest in French religious affairs from his
base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors there to lead
congregations. Despite intense persecution, the Reformed tradition
steadily advanced in large parts of the country, appealing to people
alienated <font color="#dcdcdc">by the stubbornness and complacency
of Catholic power</font>. French Protestantism took on a distinctly
political character, which became even more evident when the nobility
converted in <font color="#2f4f4f">the 1550s.</font> This set the
stage for a series of conflicts known as the French Wars of Religion.
The civil wars gained momentum with the sudden death of <font color="#556b2f">Henry
II of </font>France in 1559. Cruelty and brutality became the
hallmarks of the times, and were at their most intense in the St
Bartholomew's Day Massacre of <font color="#6b8e23">August 1572</font>,
when the Roman Catholic side exterminated between 30 000 and 100 000
Huguenots across France. The wars only ended when Henry IV of France
issued the Edict of Nantes, which promised official tolerance for the
Protestant minority, but under very limited conditions. Roman
Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the position of
French Protestants gradually deteriorated over the next century,
culminating in Louis XIV's Edict of Fontainebleau, which repealed the
Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the only legal religion
again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, Frederick William I
of Brandenburg proclaimed the Edict of Potsdam, giving free access to
Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century, many Huguenots fled to
England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland and the overseas
colonies of England and the Netherlands. In France, a significant
community remained in the Cévennes.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The political separation of the
Church of England from Rome under <font color="#a9a9a9">Henry VIII
</font>brought England into line with this broad Reformation
movement. The Reformers of the Church of England alternated between
their sympathies for the old Catholic tradition and more Reformed
principles, and gradually a tradition developed which was seen as a
middle ground (through the media) between the Roman Catholic and
Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular
line. The different nature of the English Reformation was primarily
due to the fact that it was initially driven by the political needs
of Henry VIII. <font color="#dcdcdc">King Henry </font>decided to
detach the Church of England from the authority of Rome. The
Supremacy Act of <font color="#2f4f4f">1534 </font>recognised Henry
as the sole supreme head of the Church of England on earth. <font color="#556b2f">Between

persecutors </font>gave them the name Anabaptist, meaning
&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">rebaptizer</font>&quot;, in reference to
the practice of rebaptizing converts who had been baptized as
infants. Anabaptists required that those seeking to be baptised could
make their own profession of faith, and thus rejected <font color="#2f4f4f">infant
baptism.</font> The early members of this movement did not accept the
name Anabaptist, arguing that since infant baptism was unbiblical and
invalid, the baptism of believers was not rebaptism but in fact their
first true baptism. Because of their views on the nature of baptism
and other issues, Anabaptists were subjected to severe persecution by
both <font color="#556b2f">learned Protestants and Roman Catholics in
</font>the 16th and 17th centuries.[aa] Although most Anabaptists
followed the literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, which
forbade taking oaths, participating in military campaigns, and
participating in civil government, some Anabaptists who practiced
rebaptism held a different view[ab][ab] Thus, they were technically
Anabaptists, although conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites,
and some historians generally consider them to be outside the realm
of true Anabaptism. The Anabaptist reformers of the Radical
Reformation were divided into a radical and a so-called second front.

Smyth.</font> According to his reading of the New Testament, he

the first Baptist church in the North American colonies. The First
Great Awakening in the mid-1700s fueled the growth of Baptists in
both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the

that preachers reduced their support for the abolition of slavery and

allows believers to use all their God-given abilities, including the
power of reason. This means that they are allowed to study God's
creation and use it responsibly and sustainably, according to Genesis

development of the humanities and sciences. Another consequence of

correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism
and <font color="#a9a9a9">early experimental science. </font>Merton's
thesis has two distinct parts: first, it theorises that science
changes <font color="#dcdcdc">as a result of the accumulation of
observations and the development of experimental techniques and
methodology</font>; second, it argues that the popularity of science
in 17th century England and the religious demographics of the Royal
Society (English scientists of the time were predominantly <font color="#2f4f4f">Puritan
or other Protestants</font>) can be explained by the correlation
between Protestantism and scientific values. Merton focused on
<font color="#556b2f">English Puritanism and German Pietism, which
were </font>responsible for the development of the scientific
revolution of the 1700s and 1700s. He explained that the link between
religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a
significant synergy between <font color="#6b8e23">ascetic Protestant
values and the values of modern science.</font> Protestant values
encouraged scientific research because they enabled science to
recognise God's influence on the world - his creation - and thus to
provide a religious justification for scientific research.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the Middle Ages, the Church and
the secular authorities were closely linked. Martin Luther made a
fundamental distinction between the religious and secular kingdoms
(<font color="#a9a9a9">the doctrine of the two kingdoms</font>).
Believers had to use <font color="#dcdcdc">reason </font>to govern
the secular realm in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine
of the priesthood of all believers greatly elevated the status of the
laity in the church. The members of the congregation had the right to
elect a priest and, if necessary, to vote to dismiss him (Treatise on
the Right and Power of a Christian Assembly or Congregation to Judge
all Doctrines, and to Call, Appoint, and Dismiss Teachers, as the
Scriptures Testify; <font color="#2f4f4f">1523</font>). <font color="#556b2f">Calvin
</font>reinforced this essentially democratic approach by including
elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his representative
church government. The <font color="#6b8e23">Huguenots </font>added
to Calvin's system of church self-government regional synods and a
national synod whose members were elected by the congregations. Other
Reformed churches adopted this system.</p>

mixture of <font color="#a9a9a9">aristocracy and democracy</font>. He
appreciated the benefits of democracy: &quot;It is a priceless gift
if God allows a people to freely choose their own authorities and
overlords.&quot; He said: &quot;It is a priceless gift if God allows
a people to freely choose their own authorities and overlords.&quot;
Calvin also believed that secular rulers lose their divine right and
must be overthrown when they rise up against God. To further protect
the rights of ordinary people, <font color="#dcdcdc">Calvin </font>proposed
that political rulers be separated by a system of checks and balances
(<font color="#2f4f4f">separation of powers).</font> In this way, he
and his followers opposed political absolutism and paved the way for
the rise of modern democracy. Along with England, the Netherlands,
under Calvinist leadership, was the freest country in Europe in the
17th and 1700s. It gave sanctuary to philosophers like <font color="#556b2f">Baruch

seventeenth-century England, the most important figures and events in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Protestants
</font>also took the initiative for religious freedom. Freedom of
conscience was at the top of the theological, philosophical and
political agenda ever since Luther refused to retreat from his
convictions at the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire of <font color="#dcdcdc">Worms
</font>(1521). According to him, faith was a free work of the Holy
Spirit and therefore could not be imposed on man. The persecuted
<font color="#2f4f4f">Anabaptists and Huguenots </font>demanded
freedom of conscience and practised the separation of church and
state. In the early 1700s, Baptists such as <font color="#556b2f">John
Smyth and Thomas Helwys </font>published tracts in defence of
religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John
Locke's position on toleration. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger
Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker and Quaker William Penn,
Rhode Island, Connecticut and Pennsylvania combined a democratic
constitution with religious freedom. These colonies became havens for
persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The US Declaration
of Independence, the US Constitution and the American Bill of Rights,
which includes basic human rights, made this tradition enduring by
providing a legal and political framework. A <font color="#6b8e23">large
majority of </font>American Protestants, both clergy and laity,
strongly supported the independence movement<font color="#6b8e23">.</font>
All the major Protestant churches were represented at the First and
Second Mannerheim Congresses. In the 19th and 20th centuries,
American democracy became a model for many other countries and
regions around the world (e.g. Latin America, Japan, Germany). The
strongest unifier of the American and French revolutions was the
Marquis de Lafayette, a passionate supporter of US constitutional
principles. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
Citizen was based mainly on Lafayette's draft. The United Nations
Declaration and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights also
reflect the American constitutional tradition.</p>

thinkers</font>. Some philosophers of the English, Scottish, German
and Swiss Enlightenment - Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, John Toland,
David Hume, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Christian Wolff, Immanuel Kant

<font color="#dcdcdc">John </font>Locke<font color="#dcdcdc">, </font>whose
political thought was based on &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">a set of
Protestant Christian assumptions</font>&quot;, derived equality for
all human beings, including the sexes (&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;),
<font color="#556b2f">from Genesis 1:26-28.</font> Since all men were
created equally free, all governments required the &quot;consent of
the governed&quot;. These ideas of Locke's were fundamental to the US
Declaration of Independence, which also derived human rights from the
biblical Creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights, and that these include <font color="#6b8e23">life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. </font>&quot;</p>

Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. </font>In other historic

remains one of the most popular religions. Although the <font color="#2f4f4f">Czech
Republic </font>was one of the most important pre-Reformation
movements, Protestant adherents are few, mainly due to historical
reasons such as the persecution of Protestants by the Catholic
Habsburgs, restrictions under Communist rule and the ongoing
secularisation process. In recent decades, the practice of religion
has declined as secularisation has increased. According to the 2012
Eurobarometer survey on religiosity in the European Union,
Protestants accounted for <font color="#556b2f">12% </font>of the EU

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The changes in global Protestantism
over the last century have been significant. Since 1900,
Protestantism has spread rapidly in <font color="#a9a9a9">Africa,
Asia, Oceania and Latin America</font>. As a result, Protestantism
has come to be called primarily a non-Western religion. Much of this
growth has occurred <font color="#dcdcdc">since World War II</font>,
with the colonisation of Africa and the removal of various
restrictions on Protestants in Latin American countries. According to
one source, Protestants accounted for 2.5% of Latin Americans, 2% of
Africans and 0.5% of Asians. In 2000, the percentage of Protestants
was 17%, more than 27% and 5.5% in the continents mentioned.
According to Mark A. Noll, <font color="#2f4f4f">79% </font>of
Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910, while most of the rest
lived in the United States and the British Commonwealth. By 2010, <font color="#556b2f">59%

consisting of a basement, a staircase and a second floor. The
auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical centre and administrative
offices are located on the basement floor. The premises used by the
Presidency for official receptions are located on the ground floor.
On the second floor, four suites, two apartments and various private
rooms make up the residential part of the palace. The building also
has a library, a heated Olympic-size swimming pool, a music room, two

do Planalto is the </font>official workplace of the President of
Brazil. It is located in the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brazil. As
the seat of government, the term <font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;Planalto&quot;
</font>is often used as a metonym for the executive branch. The main
office of the President of the Republic is located in the Palácio do
Planalto. The President and his family do not live there, but in an
official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada. In addition to the
President, high-ranking advisers such as the <font color="#556b2f">Brazilian
Vice-President and the Secretary General also have </font>offices in
Planalto. Other ministries are located along the Esplanada dos
Ministérios. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was <font color="#6b8e23">Oscar
Niemeyer</font>, who designed most of Brazil's important buildings.
The idea was to create an image of simplicity and modernity by using
fine lines and waves to form the columns and exterior structures. The
palace has four floors and covers an area of <font color="#228b22">36
