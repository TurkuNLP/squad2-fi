<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Mali (i/ˈmɑːli/; French [maˈli]),
officially the Republic <font color="#a9a9a9">of Mali </font>(French:
République du Mali), is a landlocked country in West Africa. <font color="#2f4f4f">Mali
is the eighth largest country in Africa, with an </font>area of just
over 1,240,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi). Mali has a
population of 14.5 million. Its capital is <font color="#556b2f">Bamako</font>.
Mali is made up of eight regions, with the northern part of the
country stretching deep into the <font color="#6b8e23">Sahara desert,
while the </font><font color="#a0522d">Niger and Senegal rivers </font>flow
into the southern part of the country, where most of the population
lives. The <font color="#228b22">country's economy </font>is centred
on agriculture and fishing. Mali's <font color="#191970">major
natural resources include gold, as it </font>is the third largest
producer of gold on the African continent, and salt. Around half of
the population lives below the international poverty line of USD 1.25
(US$) per day. The majority of the population <font color="#8b0000">(55%)
are non-religious Muslims</font>.</p>

of Sudan) was united with Senegal in 1959 and became independent in

withdrawal from the federation, the Republic of Sudan declared its
independence as the Republic of Mali. After a long period of
one-party rule, a coup d'état in 1991 led to the drafting of a new
constitution and the establishment of <font color="#3cb371">Mali as a

one of the most important public art collections between Washington

hosted major exhibitions of <font color="#2f4f4f">Auguste Rodin

(2006-2007), attracting more than <font color="#6b8e23">200,000

The museum's open-air park is one of the largest such art parks in
the country. A major extension to the museum's premises, which
significantly expanded the exhibition space, was completed <font color="#228b22">in

safe, evidence-based nutritional advice, including an eating review,
a thorough nutritional health assessment and an individualised

Clinical Nut<font color="#dcdcdc">ritionists</font>, or CCNs, are
trained health professionals who also provide nutritional counselling
on the role of nutrition in chronic diseases, including possible
prevention or correction by addressing nutritional deficiencies
before resorting to medication. Government regulation, particularly
licensing, is currently less common for CCN than for RD or <font color="#2f4f4f">RDN.
</font>Another advanced nutrition professional is the certified
<font color="#556b2f">nutritionist</font>, or CNS. These
board-certified nutritionists usually specialize in obesity and
chronic diseases. To become board certified, a CNS candidate must
pass an exam, just like registered dietitians. The exam covers

study of nutrition probably began <font color="#a9a9a9">in the 6th
century BC</font>. In China, the concept of qi, spirit or 'wind',
developed, similar to what Western Europeans later called <font color="#dcdcdc">pneuma.
</font>Food was classified as '<font color="#2f4f4f">hot</font>' (for
example, meat, blood, ginger and hot spices) and 'cold' (green
vegetables) in China, India, Malaya and Persia. Drugs were perhaps
first developed in China alongside qi. The doctor Ho concluded that
diseases were caused by deficiencies in the elements (Wu Xing: fire,
water, earth, wood and metal) and classified diseases and prescribed
diets. Around the same time in Italy, Croton's Alcmaeon (<font color="#556b2f">Greek)
</font>wrote about the importance of balance between the inputs and
outputs, and warned that imbalance leads to diseases with obesity or

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Galen's teachings should not be
forgotten: from Galen's life in the 1st century AD until the 17th
century, it was heresy to disagree with him for <font color="#a9a9a9">1500
</font>years. Galen was a physician to the gladiators in Pergamon and
in Rome to <font color="#dcdcdc">Marcus Aurelius </font>and the three
emperors who succeeded him. Most of Galen's teachings were collected
and expanded in the late 1100s by <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Benedictine monks </font>of the Salerno school in the Regimen
sanitatis Salernitanum, which was still in use in the 1600s. Galenos
believed in the humus in Hippocrates' body and taught that pneuma was
the <font color="#556b2f">source of life.</font> The four elements
(earth, air, fire and water) combine to form a 'complexion', which
combines into states (four temperaments: sanguine, phlegmatic,
choleric and melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of
characteristics (hot and humid, cold and humid, hot and dry, and cold
and dry) consisting of <font color="#6b8e23">four humours</font>:
blood, mucus, green (or yellow) bile and black bile (the embodied
form of the elements). For Galen, having gout, kidney stones or
arthritis was scandalous, and Gratzer compares this to Samuel
Butler's Erehwon (1872), in which illness is a crime.</p>

converted (with energy expenditure) into glucose and can be used for
energy production in the same way as normal glucose in a process

is a </font>carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed by humans and
some animals. Like all carbohydrates, it can produce <font color="#dcdcdc">four
</font>calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram in the metabolism.
In most circumstances, however, its contribution is lower because of
its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fibre is composed
mainly of <font color="#2f4f4f">cellulose</font>, a large
carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible because humans lack the
enzymes needed to break it down. There are two sub-categories of
dietary fibre: soluble and insoluble fibre. Whole grains, fruits
(especially prunes, plums and figs) and vegetables are good sources
of dietary fibre. A high-fibre diet has many health benefits. Dietary
fibre helps reduce digestive problems such as <font color="#556b2f">constipation
</font>and diarrhoea by increasing the weight and size of stools and
softening them. Insoluble fibre, found in wholemeal cereals, nuts and
vegetables, particularly stimulates peristalsis, the rhythmic muscle
contractions in the intestines that move along the digestive tract.
Soluble fibre, found in oats, peas, beans and many fruits, dissolves
in water in the gut and forms a gel that slows the movement of food
through the intestines. This can help lower blood sugar levels
because it can <font color="#6b8e23">slow down the absorption of
sugar.</font> In addition, fibre, perhaps especially from wholegrain
cereals, is thought to potentially help reduce insulin spikes and
thus reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased
fibre consumption and reduced risk of colorectal cancer is still
uncertain.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A dietary fat molecule typically
consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and
hydrogen atoms) bound to <font color="#a9a9a9">glycerol</font>. They
typically occur as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to <font color="#dcdcdc">a
single </font>glycerol backbone). Fats can be classified as saturated
or unsaturated depending on the <font color="#2f4f4f">detailed
structure of the fatty acids</font>. In saturated fats, all the
carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains are bonded to hydrogen atoms,
whereas in unsaturated fats some of these carbon atoms are double
bonded, so that their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms
than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats can
be further classified as monounsaturated (one double bond) or
polyunsaturated (many double bonds). In addition, depending on the
position of the double bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated
fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans
fats are <font color="#6b8e23">unsaturated fats </font>with
trans-isomer bonds; they are rarely found in nature and in foods from
natural sources; they are typically produced by an industrial process
called (partial) hydrogenation. Each gram of fat contains nine

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Most fatty acids are not essential,
which means that <font color="#a9a9a9">the body can produce them as
needed</font>, usually from other fatty acids and always by consuming
energy. In humans, however, at least <font color="#dcdcdc">two </font>fatty
acids are essential and must be present in the diet. An appropriate
balance of essential fatty acids - omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids -
also appears to be important for health, although there is no
definitive experimental evidence. Both of these long-chain
polyunsaturated omega fatty acids are substrates for a class of
eicosanoids called prostaglandins, which have functions throughout
the human body. They are, in some respects, hormones. <font color="#2f4f4f">Omega-3
eicosapentaenoic acid </font>(EPA), which can be produced in the
human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid, alpha-linolenic
acid (ALA), or obtained from marine food sources, acts as a building
block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. the mildly inflammatory
PGE3). Omega-6-dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) acts as a building
block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1),
while arachidonic acid (AA) acts as a building block for series 2
prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE2). Both DGLA and AA can be
produced in the human body <font color="#556b2f">from omega-6
linoleic acid </font>(LA) or can be taken directly from the diet. A
balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids partly influences
the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one
reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids is
thought to be important for cardiovascular health. In industrialised
societies, people typically consume large amounts of <font color="#6b8e23">processed

building blocks in a large part of the animal body (e.g. muscles,

reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of
<font color="#dcdcdc">amino acids, which are </font>characterised by
nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for
the distinctive smell of a burning protein such as keratin in hair).
The body needs amino acids to produce new proteins (<font color="#2f4f4f">protein

Since there are no proteins or amino acids stored, amino acids must
be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are usually excreted <font color="#556b2f">in

(the animal cannot produce them internally) and some are
non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogenous
compounds). There are about <font color="#6b8e23">twenty </font>amino
acids in the human body, of which about ten are essential and
therefore must be included in the diet. An adequate diet containing
amino acids (especially the essential ones) is particularly important
in certain situations: during early development and maturation,
pregnancy, lactation or injury (e.g. burns). A complete protein
source contains all essential amino acids; an incomplete protein

maintain proper hydration. However, there is no credible scientific
source that suggests that people should drink eight glasses of water

the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council in 1945
</font>was as follows: 'The usual standard for well-rounded
individuals is <font color="#2f4f4f">1 millilitre </font>for every
calorie of food. Most of this amount is contained in convenience
foods.&quot; More recent comparisons of known recommendations for
fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies between the amounts of
water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to facilitate
harmonisation of guidelines, recommendations on water consumption
have been included in two recent European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary recommendations and
(ii) Nutrient Reference Intakes or Adequate<font color="#556b2f">
Daily Intakes </font>(ADI) for water. These specifications were
provided by calculating the ADI from the measured intakes in
populations of individuals with &quot;desirable urinary osmolarity
values and desirable water intakes per unit of energy consumed&quot;.
To ensure healthy hydration, current EFSA guidelines recommend a
total water intake of 2.0 litres per day for adult women and 2.5
litres per day for adult men. These reference values include water
from drinking water, other beverages and food. Around 80% of our
daily water needs come from the drinks we drink and the remaining 20%
<font color="#6b8e23">from food.</font> Water content varies
according to the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables,
for example, containing more water than cereals. These values are
estimated from country food balances published by the Food and

guidelines also have an impact on the drinks we consume for healthy
hydration. For example, the World Health Organisation (WHO)

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As cells require oxygen for
metabolism/energy production, potentially harmful (e.g. <font color="#a9a9a9">mutagenic</font>)
compounds called free radicals can be formed. Most of these are
oxidants (i.e. <font color="#dcdcdc">electron acceptors</font>) and
some react very strongly. In order for normal cell maintenance,
growth and division to continue, these free radicals must be
adequately neutralised <font color="#2f4f4f">by antioxidant
compounds.</font> Recently, some scientists proposed an interesting
theory on the evolution of dietary antioxidants. The human body
produces some of them with sufficient precursors (glutathione,
vitamin C), and those that the body cannot produce can only be
obtained from direct dietary sources (vitamin C in humans, vitamin A,
vitamin K) or can be produced by the body from other compounds
(beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A, vitamin D,
which is synthesised from cholesterol by sunlight). The majority of
antioxidants are phytochemicals (see section below) and a subgroup of
<font color="#556b2f">polyphenols</font>; there are about 4 000 of
them. The various antioxidants are now known to act in a cooperative
network. For example, vitamin C can reactivate free
radical-containing glutathione or vitamin E by accepting a free
radical itself. Some antioxidants are more effective than others in
neutralising different types of free radicals. Some are unable to
neutralise certain free radicals. Some cannot be present in certain
areas where free radicals develop (vitamin A is fat soluble and
protects <font color="#6b8e23">fatty areas</font>, vitamin C is water
soluble and protects these areas). When some antioxidants interact
with a free radical, they produce another type of free radical
compound that is less or more dangerous than the previous compound.
The existence of a variety of antioxidants means that any by-products
can be safely treated with more potent antioxidants to neutralise the
butterfly effect of free radicals.</p>

obesity-related diseases are on the rise worldwide. There is no doubt
that <font color="#a9a9a9">the increasing use of some modern food
processing techniques </font>has contributed to this trend. The food
industry is an important part of the modern economy and as such
influences policy decisions (e.g. <font color="#dcdcdc">nutrition
recommendations</font>, agricultural subsidies). In all known
for-profit economies, health considerations are hardly a priority,
but rather the trend is towards <font color="#2f4f4f">efficient
production of cheap and long-lasting food.</font> In general, fresh,
whole foods have a relatively short shelf life and are less
profitable to produce and sell than processed foods. The consumer is
therefore faced with a choice between more expensive but
nutritionally <font color="#556b2f">superior </font>fresh whole foods
and cheaper, usually less nutritious processed foods. Because
processed foods are often cheaper, <font color="#6b8e23">more
convenient </font>(both in terms of purchase, storage and

conflict fought between October <font color="#a9a9a9">1853 </font>and
March <font color="#dcdcdc">1856</font>, in which Russia lost to an
alliance of France, the United Kingdom, the Ottoman Empire and

were the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of
Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the
expense of the Ottomans. It is generally agreed that the causes,
which in one case involved a dispute over a key, never revealed &quot;a

force the Ottomans to recognise France as the &quot;sovereign
authority&quot; over the Christian population:19 Russia contested
this attempt to change the position of authority. The Ottomans,
referring to two other treaties, the Treaty of 1757 and the Treaty of
Küçük Kaynarca of 1774, revoked their earlier decision, renounced
the French treaty and insisted that Russia was the patron of Orthodox
Christians in the Ottoman Empire.</p>

Black Sea Fleet operated against Ottoman coastal traffic between the
ports of Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the Caucasus, while the
Ottoman Navy sought to protect this supply line. The clash occurred
on 30 November 1853, when the Russian navy attacked and destroyed the
Ottoman forces in the <font color="#a9a9a9">port of Sinop at the

called for war. Little further naval action took place until March

Although the Charge of the Light Brigade has traditionally been seen

historians say that the Charge of the Light Brigade succeeded in at
least some of its objectives. The aim of any cavalry charge is to
break up enemy lines and scare the enemy off the battlefield. The
light brigade's charge had so unnerved the Russian cavalry, which had
earlier been driven off by the heavy brigade, that a subsequent
charge by the light brigade caused the Russian cavalry to make a
full-scale rout. &quot;252</p>

north, the <font color="#a9a9a9">Turks </font>captured the frontier
fortress of St Nicholas in a surprise attack at night (27/28
October). They then pushed some <font color="#dcdcdc">20,000 soldiers
</font>across the Cholok River border. Outnumbered, the Russians
abandoned Poti and Redut Kale and retreated to <font color="#2f4f4f">Maran</font>.
Both sides remained motionless for the next seven months. 2. In the
centre, the Turks moved north from Ardahan to within cannon shot of
Akhaltsike and waited for <font color="#556b2f">reinforcements </font>(13
November). They were expelled by the Russians. Claimed casualties
were 4,000 Turks and 400 Russians. 3. In the south, some <font color="#6b8e23">30,000
</font>Turks slowly moved east towards the main Russian stronghold at
Gyumri or Alexandropol (November). They crossed the border and set up
artillery positions south of the town. Prince Orbeliani tried to
drive them out and was trapped. The Turks failed to use their
advantage, the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks
retreated west. Orbeliani lost about 1000 men out of 5000. The
Russians now decided to advance, the Turks took a strong position on
the Kars road and attacked. They suffered defeat at the Battle of
Başgedikler, where they lost 6,000 men, half their artillery and
their entire supply train. The Russians lost 1300 men, including
Prince Orbeliani. This was Prince Ellico Orbeliani, whose wife was
later kidnapped by Shamyl at Tsinandal. At sea, the Turks sent a
fleet east, which was destroyed by Admiral Nakhimov at Sinope.</p>

Baltic Fleet, outnumbered, restricted its movements to the areas
around its forts. Meanwhile, the British and French commanders Sir
Charles Napier and Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes - despite
leading the largest fleet assembled since the Napoleonic Wars - felt
that Sveaborg Fortress was too well defended to attack. Thus, the
bombardment of Russian batteries was limited to two attempts in the
summers of 1854 and 1855, and initially the attacking fleets
restricted their activities to blocking Russian trade in the Gulf of
Finland. Naval attacks on other ports, such as Hogland Island in the
Gulf of Finland, proved more successful. In addition, the Allies made
attacks on less fortified parts of the Finnish coast. These battles
are known in Finland as the Åland War.</p>

opposed Russia on the Eastern Question during his reign. However,
Russia's involvement in the Ottoman Empire did not pose any
significant threat to French interests. Thus, France abandoned its
opposition to Russia after the establishment of the Republic.

punished Russia, in the long run <font color="#a9a9a9">Austria </font>lost
the most from the Crimean War, even though it did not participate
much.433 Having abandoned its alliance with Russia, Austria became
diplomatically isolated after the war, which contributed to its
catastrophic defeats in the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, which led to
the cession of Lombardy <font color="#dcdcdc">to the Kingdom of
Sardinia </font>and later to the loss of Habsburg-ruled Tuscany and

the loss of Venice and, more importantly, the loss of its influence
in most German-speaking countries. Austria's status as a great power
with the unification of Germany and Italy was now seriously
challenged. It was forced to compromise with Hungary, the two
countries shared the Danube Empire, and Austria slowly became little
more than a satellite of Germany. With France now hostile to Germany
and allied with Russia, and with Russia competing with the newly
renamed Austria-Hungary for a greater role in the Balkans at the
expense of the Ottoman Empire, the stage was set for the creation of
the diplomatic alliances that would lead to the First World War.</p>

mutual associations, cooperatives, unions, trade associations, credit
unions, trade associations, sports clubs, retired soldiers' clubs,
and top organizations - organizations that <font color="#a0522d">benefit
a specific group of people, i.e., the organization's members.
</font>Typically, community-serving organizations focus on <font color="#228b22">providing
services to the community </font><font color="#191970">at large,
either globally or locally</font>: organizations that provide
humanitarian service programs or projects, relief and development
programs, medical research, educational and health services, and so
on. It can be argued that many non-profit organisations fall into
both camps, at least in terms of their impact. For example, a
grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those suffering
from a particular illness can be seen as serving both its members (<font color="#8b0000">by

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The two main types of non-profit
organisations are <font color="#a9a9a9">membership organisations and
government-only organisations</font>. A member organisation <font color="#dcdcdc">elects
a board of directors, has regular meetings and the right to change
the rules</font>. A board-only organisation typically has a
<font color="#2f4f4f">self-elected board and a membership whose
powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. </font>The
bylaws of a board-only organization may even state that the
organization has no members, although the organization's literature
may refer to its donors or recipients of services as &quot;members&quot;;
examples of such organizations include <font color="#556b2f">Fairvote
and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</font>.
The Model Law on Non-Profit Non-Profit Corporations imposes <font color="#6b8e23">many
complexities and requirements </font>on membership decision-making.
As a result, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed
<font color="#a0522d">board-only </font>structures. The National
Association of Parliamentarians has expressed concern <font color="#228b22">about
the impact of this trend on the future transparency, accountability
and understanding of public concerns of </font>non-profit
organizations. In particular, they note that unlike businesses,
non-profit organisations are not <font color="#191970">subject to
market discipline on products or shareholder capital.</font> Thus,
without member control over important decisions such as board
selection, there is little protection against abuse. This can be
countered by the fact that as nonprofits grow and seek larger

be <font color="#a9a9a9">incorporated or unincorporated</font>.
Non-profit corporations can be incorporated either at the federal
level under Part II of the Canada Business Corporations Act or under
provincial legislation. Many of Canada's laws governing the operation
of non-profit corporations date back to the early 20th century, which
means that the <font color="#dcdcdc">law governing non-profit
corporations has not kept pace with the law governing for-profit
corporations</font>, particularly with regard to corporate
governance. At the federal level and in some provinces (such as
Ontario), incorporation is <font color="#2f4f4f">by way of a book
patent, </font>and any change to the book patent (even a simple name
change) requires <font color="#556b2f">formal approval by the

(such as Alberta) incorporation is possible as such <font color="#6b8e23">by

building </font>is an ongoing problem that <font color="#dcdcdc">non-profit
organisations </font>face for a number of reasons. Most depend on
<font color="#2f4f4f">external funding </font>(<font color="#556b2f">government
funds, charitable foundation grants, direct donations</font>) to
sustain their operations, and changes in these revenue sources can
affect how reliably or predictably an organization can hire and
<font color="#6b8e23">retain staff, maintain facilities</font>,
create programs, or maintain tax-exempt status. For example, a
university that sells research to for-profit companies may have
tax-exempt status problems. In addition, <font color="#a0522d">unreliable
funding, long hours and low pay </font>can cause problems with
employee retention<font color="#a0522d">. In </font>2009, the US
government recognised this critical need by including a <font color="#228b22">capacity
building programme for non-profit organisations </font>in the Serve
America Act. In <font color="#8b0000">2010, the </font>proposed
<font color="#191970">Nonprofit Sector and Community Solutions Act
</font>included additional measures to quantify the scope of the
sector and propose policy solutions for the community.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In Australia, non-profit
organisations include trade unions, charities, cooperatives,
universities and hospitals, mutual societies, grassroots and support
groups, political parties, religious groups, associations, non-profit
companies, foundations and others. They also operate in a wide range
of sectors and industries, from health, employment, disability and
other human services to local sports clubs, credit unions and
research institutes. An Australian not-for-profit organisation may
choose <font color="#a9a9a9">different legal forms </font>depending
on the needs and activities of the organisation: co-operative,
company limited by guarantee, unincorporated association,
<font color="#dcdcdc">incorporated association </font>(Associations

association or council (<font color="#556b2f">Commonwealth Aboriginal

</font>From an academic perspective, social enterprises are largely
considered <font color="#a0522d">a subset of the not-for-profit
sector </font>because they typically also have a <font color="#228b22">public

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">&quot;All our modern academic
disciplines have their roots in literature.&quot;  <font color="#a9a9a9">Literature
in all its forms </font>can be seen as <font color="#dcdcdc">a
literary record</font>, and whether literature is fact or fiction, it
is still perfectly possible to interpret facts by the actions and
words of characters, or the style of writing and the meaning behind
the words of authors. The plot is not just for <font color="#2f4f4f">entertainment;
</font>within it are insights into <font color="#556b2f">economics,
psychology, science, religion, politics, cultures and social depth.
</font>The study and analysis of <font color="#6b8e23">literature
</font>becomes very important for learning <font color="#a0522d">our
history.</font> Through the study of past literature, we can learn
about how society has developed and what social norms have existed in
each different period throughout history. This can even help us
understand the references made in <font color="#228b22">more modern
</font>literature, as writers often refer to <font color="#191970">Greek
mythology and other </font><font color="#8b0000">ancient religious
texts or historical moments.</font> There is literature on each of
these topics and how they have evolved over history (for example, a
book on the history of economics or a book on evolution and science),
but we can also learn about them in works of fiction. Writers often
include historical moments in their works, as when <font color="#483d8b">Lord
Byron </font>talks about <font color="#3cb371">the Spanish and the
</font><font color="#bc8f8f">French </font>in 'The <font color="#663399">Pilgrimage
of Childe Harold': Canto I'' </font>and expresses his views through
his character <font color="#008080">Childe Harold</font>. Through
<font color="#bdb76b">literature </font>we can constantly discover
new information about history. It is easy to see that all academic
disciplines have their roots in literature. Knowledge was easier to
pass on from one generation to the next <font color="#4682b4">when it
started to be written down</font>. Eventually, everything was written
down, from home remedies and cures for illnesses or building shelters
to traditional and religious practices. From then on, people were
able to study literature, improve their minds, increase their
knowledge and enter academic fields such as medicine or the
professions. Just as today, the literature we study is constantly
updated as we evolve and learn more and more.</p>

theory of &quot;third force psychology&quot; even allows literary
analysts to critically understand how characters reflect the culture
and history in which they are contextualised. It also allows analysts
to understand the intended message of the writer and to understand
the psychology of the writer. According to the theory, <font color="#dcdcdc">people
have a </font><font color="#2f4f4f">nature within them that shows
their true &quot;self&quot;, and the </font><font color="#dcdcdc">realisation
of this nature is the </font><font color="#556b2f">reason for living</font><font color="#dcdcdc">.
</font>It also suggests that <font color="#6b8e23">neurological
development </font>prevents the realisation of nature, as people
become alienated from their true selves. Therefore, literary devices
reflect the natural self of the characters and the writer. In his

Islamic jurisprudence). <font color="#dcdcdc">The medieval historian
Ẓahīr al-dīn al-Bayhaqī </font>(d. 1169) considered <font color="#2f4f4f">Avicenna
</font>to be a follower of <font color="#6b8e23">the Brothers of
Purity. </font>On the other hand, Dimitri Gutas, together with Aisha
Khan and <font color="#a0522d">Jules J. Janssens, </font>showed that
Avicenna was a <font color="#228b22">Sunni </font><font color="#191970">Hanafi.
</font>However, according to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, the 14th century
Shiafaqih <font color="#8b0000">Nurullah Shushtari </font>argued that
he was probably a Twelver Shia. In contrast, Sharaf Khorasani, who
suggests that <font color="#3cb371">Avicenna </font>rejected the
invitation of <font color="#483d8b">the Sunni governor Sultan Mahmoud
</font>Ghazanavi to his court, believes that Avicenna was an Ismaili.

family: some authors considered them to be Sunnis, while some more

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When Ibn Sina was <font color="#dcdcdc">22
years old</font>, he lost his father. <font color="#556b2f">The
Samanid dynasty </font>ended in December 1004. Ibn Sina seems to have
refused <font color="#6b8e23">Mahmud Ghazni's </font>offers and went
west to Urgench in present-day <font color="#a0522d">Turkmenistan,
</font>where the <font color="#228b22">vizier</font>, considered a
friend of the scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The salary
was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through
the districts of <font color="#191970">Nishapur </font>and Merv to
the borders of Khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents. The
generous ruler of Tabaristan, Qabus, himself a poet and scholar, with
whom Ibn Sina had expected to find refuge, was starved to death that
day (1012) by his rebellious troops. Ibn Sina himself fell seriously
ill at the time. Eventually, Ibn Sina met a friend in Gorgan, near
the Caspian Sea, who bought an apartment near his own house, where
Ibn Sina lectured on logic and astronomy. Several of Ibn Sina's
treatises were written for this patron, and the beginning of his
<font color="#8b0000">medical canon </font>also dates from his stay
in the Hyrkanian region.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Later, Ibn Sina settled in <font color="#a9a9a9">Rey</font>,
near present-day <font color="#dcdcdc">Tehran</font>, the hometown of
Rhazes, where Majd Addaula, son of the last Buwayhid emir, was the
nominal ruler under the rule of his mother (Seyyedeh Khatu). Some
<font color="#2f4f4f">thirty </font>of Ibn Sina's shorter works are
said to have been written in Rey. However, constant quarrels between
<font color="#556b2f">the Regent and his second son </font>Shams
al-Daula forced the scholar to leave the place. After a short stay in
Qazvin, he moved south to <font color="#6b8e23">Hamadãn</font>,
where <font color="#a0522d">Shams al-Daula</font>, another Buwayhid
emir, had settled. Initially, Ibn Sina was employed by a noblewoman,
but when the emir heard of his arrival, he called him a medical
officer and sent him back to his residence with gifts. Ibn Sina was
even elevated <font color="#228b22">to the post of vizier</font>. The
emir ordered that he be banished from the country. However, Ibn Sina
remained in hiding for forty days in Sheikh <font color="#191970">Ahmed
Fadhel's </font>house until a new attack of illness prompted the emir
to reinstate him. Even during this troubled period, Ibn Sina
persevered in his studies and teaching. Every evening he dictated and
explained to his students extracts from his great works, the Canon
and the Sanat. When the <font color="#8b0000">emir </font>died, Ibn
Sina gave up his duties as vizier and hid in the apothecary's house,
where he continued to write his works diligently.</p>

cannot in themselves interact with each other and give rise to the
movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing
things. Existence must therefore be the result of an agent-causation
which makes essence necessary, mediates it, gives it, or adds it to
essence. For this to happen, <font color="#228b22">the cause </font>must
be an existent thing and must coexist with its agent.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Avicenna's reflection on the
question of essence-attributes can be clarified by his ontological
analysis of the modalities of being, namely impossibility,
contingency and <font color="#a9a9a9">necessity</font>. <font color="#dcdcdc">Avicenna
</font>argued that an impossible being is one that cannot exist,
while <font color="#2f4f4f">a contingent self </font>(mumkin
bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing
a contradiction. When the contingent is actualized, it becomes &quot;a
necessary existence because of what is other than itself&quot; (wajib
al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, <font color="#556b2f">the contingent
itself </font>is a potential being that could eventually be
actualized for some external cause other than itself. The
metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different.
Self-induced necessary being (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in
itself, whereas contingent being is &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">false
in itself</font>&quot; and &quot;true for the sake of something other

he regarded as 'inspired philosophers') and also on various
scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Qur'an, such as
how the cosmology of the Qur'an corresponds to his own philosophical

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">While imprisoned in <font color="#a9a9a9">Fardajan
Castle </font>near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote the famous <font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;</font><font color="#2f4f4f">floating
man&quot; </font>- literally, falling man - thought experiment to
demonstrate the principles of human self-consciousness and the
insubstantiality and immateriality of the soul. <font color="#556b2f">Avicenna
</font>believed his 'Floating Man' thought experiment demonstrated
that the soul is <font color="#6b8e23">substance, </font>and argued
that man cannot doubt his own consciousness even in a situation that
precludes the input of all sense information. In the thought
experiment, his readers were asked to <font color="#a0522d">imagine
themselves as being created all at once, </font><font color="#228b22">floating
in mid-air, isolated from all sensory input</font><font color="#a0522d">,
which means that there is no sensory contact even with their own
bodies.</font> In this scenario, he argued, a person would still have
self-awareness. Since it is conceivable that a person floating in the
air and disconnected from sensory experience would still be able to
define his or her own existence, the thought experiment suggests the
conclusion that <font color="#191970">the soul </font>is a perfection
independent of the body and immaterial substance. The thinkability of
this &quot;floating man&quot; indicates that the soul is perceived
<font color="#8b0000">intellectually, </font>which implies the soul's
separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human
intellect, especially <font color="#483d8b">the active intellect,

communicates truth to the human mind and gives order and

the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent

being. Of course, this essence could not be a <font color="#556b2f">body,
</font>since the flying person <font color="#6b8e23">has no
sensations</font>. Thus, the <font color="#a0522d">knowledge that &quot;I
am&quot; </font>is the essence of man: the soul exists and is
self-aware. Avicenna thus concluded that <font color="#228b22">the
idea of selfhood </font>is not logically dependent on any physical
thing and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms but as a
primary given, a substance. The <font color="#191970">body </font>is

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the Al-Burhan (On Demonstration)
section of the Book of Healing, Avicenna discussed the philosophy of
science and described the early <font color="#a9a9a9">scientific
method of inquiry</font>. He discusses Aristotle's <font color="#2f4f4f">Posterior
Analytics </font>and differed significantly from it in several
points. Avicenna addressed the question of the correct methodology of
scientific research and the question &quot;How are the first
principles of science acquired?&quot;. He asked how a scientist would
arrive at &quot;the first axioms or hypotheses of deductive science
without deducing them from some more fundamental premises&quot;. He
explained that the ideal situation is when one realises that &quot;there
is a relation between terms which would allow absolute, universal
certainty&quot;. Avicenna then adds two other methods for discovering
first principles: the ancient Aristotelian method of induction
(istiqra) and the method of investigation and experimentation
(tajriba). Avicenna criticises <font color="#556b2f">Aristotelian
induction</font>, arguing that 'it does not lead to the absolute,
universal and certain premises it claims to offer'. In its place, he
develops '<font color="#6b8e23">an experimental method as an
instrument of scientific investigation</font>'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Avicenna psychology requires that
the connection between body and soul be <font color="#a9a9a9">strong
enough </font>to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to
allow the soul to be immortal. Avicenna bases his psychology on
<font color="#dcdcdc">physiology, </font>which means that his account
of the soul deals almost exclusively with the natural science of the
body and its perceptual capacities. Thus, the philosopher's
connection between soul and body is explained almost entirely by <font color="#2f4f4f">his
conception of perception</font>; in this way, bodily perception
interacts with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception,
the perceiver senses the form of an object; first by perceiving the
features of the object <font color="#556b2f">with our external
senses</font>. This sensory information is transmitted to the inner
senses, which put all the pieces together into a whole, coherent
conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is
the soul-body connection, as the material body can only perceive
material objects, while the immaterial soul can only perceive
immaterial, universal forms. The way in which the soul and body
interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete
particular is the key to their relationship and interaction in the
<font color="#6b8e23">physical body.</font></p>

some influence on later writers, although in general his work can be
considered less developed than that of Alhazen or <font color="#a9a9a9">Al-Biruni</font>.
One important feature of his writings is that he considers
<font color="#dcdcdc">mathematical astronomy </font>as a separate
discipline from astrology. He criticised Aristotle's view that the
stars are illuminated by the Sun, stating that the stars are luminous
and believing that the planets are also luminous. He claimed to have
observed <font color="#556b2f">Venus </font>as a point on the Sun.
This is possible, as there was a transit on 24 May 1032, but Avicenna
did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have
questioned whether he could have detected the transit from his
position at that time; he may have mistaken the sunspot for Venus. He
used his transit observations to prove that Venus was at least
sometimes <font color="#6b8e23">below the Sun in </font>Ptolemaic
cosmology, i.e. the orb of Venus comes before the orb of the Sun as
it moves outward from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.</p>

Muslim medicine. He is remembered in Western medical history as an
important historical figure who made a significant contribution to
medicine and the European Renaissance. His medical texts were unusual
in that, when Galen's and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such
as anatomy) were disputed, he preferred to side with Aristotle,
updating Aristotle's position where necessary in the light of
post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge. Aristotle's
dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars
meant that Avicenna's combination of Galen's medical writings with
Aristotle's philosophical writings in the canon of medicine (and its
comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly
increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe compared to other
Islamic medical writers. His influence after the translation of the
canon was so great that <font color="#a0522d">from the early 1300s

Western Zhou and early Eastern Zhou script, the mainstream script
evolved slowly and uninterruptedly until it took the form now known
as the seal script in the late Eastern Zhou period of the Qin state,
without any clear dividing line. At the same time, other <font color="#a9a9a9">forms

forms such as the gǔwén ('<font color="#dcdcdc">ancient forms</font>')

script, which </font>had developed slowly in Qin State during the
Eastern Zhou Dynasty, was standardised and adopted as the official
script throughout China during the Qin Dynasty (leading to the common
misconception that it had been invented at that time), and was still
widely used in decorative engravings and seals (nameplates or seals)
during the Han Dynasty. However, despite the standardisation of the
Qin script, more than one script was still in use at the time. For
example, the little-known, straightforward and crudely executed plain
(vulgar) script had been used for centuries in Qin alongside the more
formal seal script, and the popularity of this vulgar script grew as
the use of the script itself became more widespread. By the time of
the Warring States, an immature form of ecclesiastical writing, known
as 'early ecclesiastical' or 'proto-ecclesiastical', had already
developed in the Qin State, based on this vulgar script and
influenced by the seal script. The coexistence of the three scripts,
the small seal script, the vulgar script and the proto-church script,
the latter of which gradually developed into <font color="#dcdcdc">the
ecclesiastical </font><font color="#2f4f4f">script </font>between the

early as 24 BC (very late Western Han period)[b],[c] and contained
the cursive forms popular at the time, as well as many elements of
the vulgar script of the warring Qin state. Around the time of the
Eastern Jin Dynasty, this Han cursive was known as <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">章草

</font>is associated with Zhong Yao, who was from the period between
Eastern Han and Cao Wei (c. 151-230 AD) and has been called the
&quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">father of regular script</font>&quot;.
However, some scholars argue that one person alone could not have
developed a new, widely adopted script, but could only have
contributed to its gradual emergence. The earliest surviving works
written in regular script are copies of Yao's works, at least one of
which was copied by Wang Xizhi. This new script, which is the
dominant Chinese script of the present day, evolved from the neatly
written form of the early semi-cursive script, with the addition of a
break (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">頓</font>/<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">顿
</font>dùn) at the end of horizontal lines and heavy tails on lines
written downwards on a right slant. The early regular script thus
emerged from the neat and formal semi-cursive, which in turn had
emerged from the neoclerical script (a simplified and convenient
ecclesiastical script). It was further developed during the Eastern
Jin Dynasty by the 'sage of calligraphy' Wang Xizhi and his son <font color="#2f4f4f">Wang
Xianzhi.</font> However, it was not widely used at that time, and
most scribes still used the neoclerical or its slightly semi-italic
form for daily writing, while the conservative bafen clerical script
was still used in some columns, alongside some semi-italic but mainly
neoclerical forms.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">For example, to find a character
whose sound is not known, such as <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">松
</font>(pine), the user first determines which part of the character
is radical (here <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">木</font>), then counts
the number of radical strokes (four) and turns to the radical index
(usually found on the inside front or back cover of a dictionary).
Under the number &quot;4&quot; representing the number of radical
strokes, the user looks for <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">木</font>,
then turns to the page number, which is the beginning of the list of
all characters containing this radical. On the page is a <font color="#a9a9a9">sub-index

are two common reasons for the ever-increasing number of signs. There
are around 300 radicals, of which 100 are in common use. Creating a
new character by modifying a radical is an easy way to distinguish
homographs from xíngshēngzì descriptive compounds. This practice
began long before Qin Shi Huang standardised Chinese writing and
continues to the present day. The traditional 3rd person pronoun tā
(<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">他 </font>&quot;he, she, it&quot;),
written in &quot;person radical&quot;, illustrates the transformation
of characters to form <font color="#a9a9a9">new ones</font>. In
modern usage, there is a graphic distinction between tā (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">她
</font>&quot;he&quot;) with &quot;female radical&quot;, tā (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">牠
</font>&quot;it&quot;) with &quot;animal radical&quot;, tā (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">它
</font>&quot;it&quot;) with &quot;roof radical&quot; and tā (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">祂
</font>&quot;he&quot;) with &quot;deity radical&quot;, One
consequence of radical modification is the <font color="#dcdcdc">fossilization
of </font>rare and obscure variant literatures, some of which are not
even used in classical Chinese. For example, he <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">和
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;harmony, peace&quot;, which
</font>combines &quot;grain radical&quot; and &quot;mouth radical&quot;,
has rare variants <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">咊</font>, with
radicals inverted, and <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">龢</font>, with
&quot;flute radical&quot;.</p>

characters </font>are primarily morphosyllabic, meaning that most
<font color="#dcdcdc">Chinese morphemes </font>are monosyllabic and
written with one character, although in modern Chinese most words are
bisyllabic and dicorphemic, consisting of two syllables, each of
which is a morpheme. In modern Chinese, 10% of morphemes occur only
as part of a given compound word. However, a few morphemes are
disyllabic, and some of them are from classical Chinese. Apart from
foreign loanwords, these are typically words for plants and small
animals. They are usually written with a pair of phonosemantic
hyphens with a common radical. Examples are <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">蝴蝶

rules of Chinese calligraphy are minimalist. Each character in
Chinese calligraphy is constructed in a uniform form by assigning it
a geometric area in which the character must appear. Each character
has a certain number of brush strokes, and no character may be added
or removed to improve its visual appearance, so as not to lose its
meaning. Nor is <font color="#2f4f4f">strict regularity </font>required,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The ethnic homogenisation of the
past four centuries has masked a deeper ancestral demography of the
Bermuda population. There is virtually no ethnic distinction between
<font color="#a9a9a9">black and white </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Bermudians
</font>other than that characteristic of recent immigrant
communities. This was not the case in the 17th century. In the first
hundred years, <font color="#2f4f4f">white Protestants of English
origin were a </font>clear majority, and white minorities were <font color="#556b2f">Irish
</font>(whose mother tongue can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and
Scots, sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homeland
following the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included
Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies,
black chattel slaves captured by Bermudian privateers, mainly from
Spanish and Portuguese ships, and Indians, mainly from Algonquian and
other tribes living along the Atlantic coast, but possibly as far
away as Mexico. By the 19th century, <font color="#6b8e23">white,
ethnically English </font>Bermudians had lost their numerical
advantage. Despite the ban on Irish immigration and repeated attempts
to force free blacks off the land and black slave owners off the
land, the amalgamation of various minority groups and some white
English had resulted in a new population group, the '<font color="#a0522d">coloured</font>'
Bermudians (a term used in Bermuda to describe anyone who was not of
fully European descent), having achieved a slight majority. All
children born before or after that date, with one parent coloured and
one white, were added to the coloured statistics. The majority of
those historically described as 'coloured' are now described as
'black' or 'of African descent', thus <font color="#228b22">obscuring
their non-African ancestry </font>(previously described as
'coloured', people of non-African descent were very rare, although
the number of South Asians in particular is now increasing. The

</font><font color="#191970">countries </font>doubled between the

with new white immigration from Portugal, the UK and elsewhere being
counterbalanced by black immigration from the West Indies.</p>

contrasts with the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies, who
experienced <font color="#228b22">such harsh conditions that their
birth rate fell below the death rate</font>, and the slave owners of
the United States and the West Indies found it necessary to import
more enslaved blacks from Africa until the end of slavery (the same
was true of the Native Americans who had been replaced by Africans on
the New World plantations). The indigenous population of many West
Indian islands and much of the southeastern part of the present-day
United States, which had survived the disease epidemics that had
spread in Europe in the 1500s and 1600s, fell victim to large-scale
slave raids, and much of the region was completely depopulated. When
the supply of local slaves ran out, slave owners turned to Africa.)
The ancestry of <font color="#191970">Bermuda's black population
</font>differs from that of the black population of the British West
Indies in two ways: first, the greater number of European and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the British West Indies (and also
in the United States), most of the <font color="#a9a9a9">enslaved
blacks brought across the Atlantic </font>came from West Africa
(roughly between present-day Senegal and Ghana). A very small
proportion of Bermuda's original black immigration came from this
region. The <font color="#dcdcdc">first blacks to arrive in Bermuda,
of which there were some, were free blacks from the </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Spanish-speaking
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">areas of the West Indies, </font>and
most of the rest were enslaved Africans recently captured from the
Spanish and Portuguese. <font color="#556b2f">Spain and Portugal
</font>acquired most of their slaves <font color="#6b8e23">from
south-west Africa </font>(the Portuguese through the ports of
present-day Angola; the Spanish bought most of their African slaves
from Portuguese traders and Arabs, whose slave trade was concentrated
in Zanzibar). Indeed, <font color="#a0522d">genetic studies </font>have
shown that the ancestry of <font color="#228b22">black </font>Africans
in <font color="#228b22">Bermuda </font>(other than those born as a
result of recent immigration from the British West Indies) is largely
from the southern African band between Angola and Mozambique, similar
to that in Latin America but markedly different from that of blacks
in the West Indies and the United States.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">For centuries, the various peoples
of modern Nigeria traded with overland traders from <font color="#a9a9a9">North
Africa</font>. The cities of the region became regional centres in a
vast network of trade routes that stretched across West, Central and
North Africa. <font color="#dcdcdc">Spanish and Portuguese </font>explorers
were the first Europeans in the 16th century to engage in significant
direct trade with the peoples of modern Nigeria at the port of Lagos
and Calabar. Europeans traded goods with coastal peoples; coastal
trade with Europeans also marked the beginning of the Atlantic slave
trade. The port of Calabar in the historic Bay of <font color="#2f4f4f">Biafra
</font>(now commonly <font color="#556b2f">called Bonny Bay</font>)
became one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa during
the transatlantic slave trade. Other important slave trading ports in
Nigeria were Badagry, Lagos in the Bay of Benin and Bonny Island in
the Bay of Biafra. Most of the enslaved people taken to these ports
were captured during raids and wars. Generally, the captives were
taken back to the conquerors' territory for forced labour, and over
time they were sometimes acculturated and assimilated into the
conquerors' society. Several slave routes ran throughout Nigeria,
linking inland areas with the main coastal ports. Some of the most
prolific slave traders were linked to <font color="#6b8e23">the Oyo
Empire </font>in the south-west, the Aro Empire in the south-east and
the Sokoto Caliphate in the north.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The slave trade was carried out by
European state and non-state actors, such as the UK, the Netherlands,
Portugal and private companies, as well as several African states and
non-state actors. As anti-slavery sentiment grew at home and economic
realities changed, Britain banned the international slave trade in
<font color="#a9a9a9">1807. </font>After the <font color="#dcdcdc">Napoleonic
Wars, </font>Britain established the West African Squadron in an
attempt to stop the international slave trade. It intercepted ships
from other countries that were leaving the coast of Africa with
slaves; the seized slaves were taken to <font color="#2f4f4f">Freetown</font>,
a colony in West Africa originally established to resettle slaves
freed from Britain. Britain intervened in the power struggle for the
Lagos kingship by bombing <font color="#556b2f">Lagos </font>in 1851,
ousting the pro-slavery <font color="#6b8e23">Oba Kosoko</font>,
helping to install the submissive Oba Akitoye, and signing a treaty
between Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as
a crown colony in August 1861 by the Lagos Cession Treaty. British
missionaries expanded their activities and travelled further inland.
In 1864, Samuel Ajayi Crowther became the first African bishop of the

form of confidence fraud perpetrated by individuals and criminal

which is </font>involved (the law is loosely legislated to allow for
this), and a fraudster who claims to have money he needs from that
bank. The victim is persuaded to exchange bank account details on the
assumption that the money will be transferred to him and he will get
to keep his share. In reality, the money is withdrawn instead and/or
large payments are deducted (which seem small compared to the
imaginary wealth he expects). In 2003, the Economic and <font color="#6b8e23">Financial

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Several <font color="#a9a9a9">churches

Romanesque building was badly damaged by fire</font>. The <font color="#6b8e23">envelope
and transept </font>were completed in 1320, followed by the
construction of an ambitious cathedral tower. The final building was
the nave in <font color="#a0522d">1420</font>, but by then the <font color="#228b22">era
of the great cathedrals had come to an end and the declining economy
prevented the ambitious project from being completed</font>, as
construction of the nave was halted before the planned flying
buttresses were completed. In <font color="#191970">addition to the
cathedral, Utrecht had four collegiate churches: The </font><font color="#8b0000">Church
of St Salvator </font>(demolished in the 16th century), located in
Dome Square and dating from the early 800s. St. John's Church
(Janskerk), dating from 1040; St. Peter's Church, construction of
which began in 1039; and St. Mary's Church, construction of which
began around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, the
monastery survives). In addition to these churches, <font color="#483d8b">the
city was also home to St. Paul's Monastery, the 15th-century St.
Nicholas Beguinage and the 14th-century Chapter House of the Teutonic
Knights.</font></p>

As the main course of the Rhine moved southwards, the old riverbed,
which still flowed through the heart of the city, was increasingly
channelled, and a quay system was built as a port system within the
city. Storage facilities (werfkelders) were built on the quays, on
top of which a main street with houses was built. The quays and
cellars are accessed from a platform at water level with stairs
descending from the street level, forming a unique structure.[nb 2]

medieval centre. In 1853, the <font color="#228b22">Dutch government
allowed Rome to restore the bishopric of Utrecht, and Utrecht </font>once
again <font color="#228b22">became the centre of Dutch Catholicism.</font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The clauses of the non-aggression
pact between the Nazis and the Soviet Union included a guarantee by
each side not to go to war against the other and a written commitment
that neither side would ally or aid the enemy of the other. In
addition to the non-aggression provisions, the treaty included a
secret protocol dividing the <font color="#a9a9a9">territories of
Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland </font>into
German and Soviet 'spheres of influence' in anticipation of possible
'territorial and political reorganisations' of these countries.
Germany then invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. After the
Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement came into force on 16 September,
Stalin ordered his own invasion of Poland on 17 September. After the
Winter War, the Soviet Union annexed part of <font color="#dcdcdc">south-eastern
Finland </font>(Karelia) and the Salla region in Finland. The Soviet
Union then annexed <font color="#2f4f4f">Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
and parts of Romania </font>(Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and the
Hertza region). Concerns about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had
been put forward as a justification for the <font color="#556b2f">Soviet
</font>invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940
violated the agreement because it went beyond the Soviet sphere of
influence agreed with the Axis powers.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the early 1930s, the rise to
power of the <font color="#a9a9a9">Nazi Party </font>increased
tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union and other countries
inhabited by ethnic Slavs, who were considered &quot;Untermenschen&quot;
(inferior) according to Nazi racial ideology. In addition,
anti-Semitic Nazis associated <font color="#dcdcdc">ethnic Jews </font>with
both communism and financial capitalism, both of which they opposed.
Thus, according to Nazi theory, the Slavs of the Soviet Union were
ruled by 'Jewish Bolshevik masters'. In 1934 Hitler himself had
spoken of an inevitable struggle against both pan-Slavism and
neo-Slavism, the victory of which would lead to 'permanent domination
of the world', although he said that they would 'go part of the way
with the Russians if it helps us'. The resulting manifestation of
German anti-Bolshevism and the increase in the Soviet Union's foreign
debt caused a dramatic decline in trade between Germany and the
Soviet Union.[b] Soviet imports of goods into Germany fell to 223
million German marks in 1934 as a more isolationist Stalinist regime
consolidated power and the abandonment of military control of the
post-World War I <font color="#2f4f4f">Treaty of Versailles </font>reduced
Germany's dependence on Soviet imports[clarification needed].[c]</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hitler's vehement anti-Soviet
rhetoric was one reason why the <font color="#a9a9a9">United Kingdom
and France </font>decided that Soviet participation in the 1938
Munich Conference on Czechoslovakia would be both dangerous and
futile. The ensuing Munich Agreement marked the partial annexation of
Czechoslovakia to Germany at the end of 1938 and its complete
dissolution in March 1939, as part of the pacification of Germany by
the <font color="#dcdcdc">Chamberlain </font>and Daladier cabinets.
This policy immediately raised the question of whether the Soviet
Union could avoid being next on Hitler's list. The Soviet leadership
believed that the West wanted to encourage German aggression in the
East and that France and Britain might remain neutral in a war
started by Germany in the hope that the warring states would tire
each other out and <font color="#556b2f">put an end to both the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since it was impossible for Germany
to act economically independently or to form an alliance with
Britain, closer relations with the Soviet Union to obtain raw
materials were essential, and not only for economic reasons.
Moreover, in the event of war, the expected <font color="#a9a9a9">blockade
of Britain </font>would leave Germany massively short of several key
raw materials. Following the Munich Agreement, the resulting increase
in Germany's need for military supplies and the Soviet Union's
demands for <font color="#dcdcdc">military aircraft, </font>negotiations
took place between the two countries from late 1938 to March 1939.
The Soviet Union's Third Five-Year Plan called for new technological
and industrial equipment. German war planners had estimated that

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 6</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Soviet Union, fearful of the
Western powers and the possibility of a &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">capitalist
blockade</font>&quot;, had little faith in the possibility of
avoiding war, and little faith in the Polish army, and wanted only an
iron military alliance with France and Britain, which would guarantee
support for a two-pronged attack on Germany; Stalin's commitment to a
policy of collective security was therefore purely conditional.
Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided and that
the <font color="#dcdcdc">Soviet Union</font>, weakened by the <font color="#2f4f4f">Great
Purge, </font>could not be the main military contributor, a view
which was contradicted by many military sources, particularly the
Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung Army on the Manchurian
frontier. <font color="#556b2f">France </font>was more eager than
Britain to find a treaty with the Soviet Union; as a power on the
continent, it was more willing to make concessions and more fearful
of the dangers of a Soviet-German treaty. These contrasting attitudes
partly explain why the Soviet Union has often been accused of playing
a double game in 1939: openly negotiating alliances with Britain and
France and secretly considering German proposals.</p>

Discussions focused on possible guarantees for Central and Eastern

Germany would constitute an 'indirect attack' against the Soviet
Union. <font color="#dcdcdc">Britain </font>opposed such proposals,
fearing that the language proposed by the Soviet Union might justify
Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic States or induce these

sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July the tripartite

Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland were divided

Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence.

the agreement was that Germany would not interfere with <font color="#556b2f">Soviet

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the Baltic states were forced
to accept the treaties, Stalin turned his gaze to Finland, confident
that Finland's surrender could be achieved without much effort. The
Soviet Union demanded territory on the Karelian Isthmus, islands in
the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital
Helsinki, which Finland refused. The Soviets staged the bombing of
Mainila and used it as an excuse to withdraw from the non-aggression
pact. The Red Army attacked in November 1939. At the same time,
Stalin established a puppet government <font color="#a9a9a9">in the
Democratic Republic of Finland</font>. [clarification] The head of
the Leningrad Military District, Andrei Zhdanov, commissioned Dmitri
Shostakovich to write a festive piece, &quot;Suite on Finnish
Themes&quot;, to be performed as the Red Army marching bands passed
through Helsinki. After the Finnish defence had unexpectedly lasted
<font color="#dcdcdc">more than three </font>months and inflicted
heavy losses on the Soviet troops, the Soviets settled for a truce.
Finland ceded the south-eastern parts of Karelia (10% of Finnish
territory), resulting in the loss of some <font color="#2f4f4f">422
000 </font>Karelian people (12% of the Finnish population). Official
Soviet casualty figures for the war were over 200 000, although

agreement after relations had been strained by disagreements over
Romanian policy, the Soviet Union's war with Finland, delays in the
delivery of goods under the German agreement, and Stalin's concern
that Hitler's war against the West might end quickly after France
signed an armistice. The interruption caused significant resource
problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations had improved
again, as the countries had redrawn the <font color="#dcdcdc">borders
of Hungary and Romania</font>, agreed on some Bulgarian claims, and
Stalin was again convinced that Germany was facing a long war in the
West as Britain improved its air campaign against Germany and
implemented the US-British agreement on fighter aircraft and bases.
In late August, <font color="#2f4f4f">however, Germany </font>organised
its own invasion of Romania, targeting the oil fields. This action

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As to the timing of the German
rapprochement, many historians agree that the expulsion of Maxim
Litvinov, whose Jewishness was frowned upon by Nazi Germany, removed
an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. <font color="#a9a9a9">Stalin
</font>immediately ordered <font color="#dcdcdc">Molotov </font>to
'clear the ministry of Jews'. Given Litvinov's previous attempts to
build an anti-fascist coalition, his association with the doctrine of
collective security with France and Britain, and his pro-Western
orientation by Kremlin standards, his dismissal showed that the
Soviet Union had the potential to move closer to Germany.[f]
Similarly, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that
the Soviet Union was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to
France and Britain the existence of a possible negotiating option
with Germany. One British author wrote that Litvinov's disappearance
also meant the loss of an admired technician or shock absorber, while
Molotov's 'modus operandi' was 'more genuinely Bolshevik than
diplomatic or cosmopolitan'. Carr argued that the Soviet replacement
of Foreign Minister Litvinov by Molotov on 3 May 1939 did not mark an
irreversible move towards alliance with Germany, but was rather
Stalin's way of conducting tough negotiations with the British and
French by appointing a proverbial hard man, Molotov, to the post of
Foreign Commissar. Historian Albert Resis noted that Litvinov's
dismissal gave the Soviets the freedom to pursue fast-paced German
negotiations, but they did not abandon the British-French
negotiations. <font color="#2f4f4f">Derek Watson </font>argued that
Molotov was able to secure the best deal with Britain and France
because he was not burdened by the burden of collective security and
was able to negotiate with Germany. <font color="#556b2f">Geoffrey
Roberts </font>argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets in
the negotiations between Britain and France because Litvinov was
sceptical or perhaps even opposed to such talks.</p>

air, vacuum, paper, mica and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used
as components of electrical circuits in many common electrical
devices. Unlike a resistor, the ideal capacitor does not waste

disconnected, a voltage may build up after a short time due <font color="#a9a9a9">to
hysteresis in the dielectric material.</font> This effect can be

the most important factor is the type of dielectric material.
Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic capacitors or polysulfone

In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies are present,

after it has been short-circuited or discharged. A capacitor with

Electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance, but suffer from
poor tolerances, high instability, gradual loss of capacitance,
especially under heat, and high leakage current. Poor quality
capacitors can leak electrolyte, which is detrimental to printed
circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte <font color="#556b2f">decreases
</font><font color="#6b8e23">at low temperatures, </font>which
increases the equivalent series resistance. Although capacitors are
widely used for power supply conditioning, their poor high-frequency
characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications.
Electrolytic capacitors degrade spontaneously if they are not used
for a period of time (about a year), and when they are switched on at
full power they may short-circuit, causing permanent damage to the
capacitor, usually resulting in fuse blowing or failure of the
rectifier diodes (for example, in older equipment, an arc is
generated in the rectifier). They can be restored before use (and
damage) <font color="#228b22">by applying the operating voltage in
steps</font>, often done in antique vacuum tube equipment over a 30
minute period using an inverter to supply the alternating current.
Unfortunately, using this technique may be less satisfactory for some
semiconductor devices, which can be damaged if operated below their
normal power range, in which case the power supply must first be
isolated from the consuming circuits. Such remedies may not be
suitable for modern high-frequency power supplies, which <font color="#191970">also
produce full output voltage at lower inputs.</font></p>

The capacitors act as a <font color="#556b2f">local backup for the DC
power supply </font>and bypass the AC currents of the power supply.

observation and induction, thus laying the foundations of the
scientific method. Aristotle also produced many biological writings
that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causality and
the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature,
particularly of the habits and characteristics of the plants and
animals of the world around him, classified over <font color="#6b8e23">540

Kuo </font>(<font color="#dcdcdc">1031-1095)</font>, a versatile
scientist and statesman who first described the magnetic needle

improved the design of the astronomical gnomon, arm ring, star tube
and clepsydra, and described the use of dry docks <font color="#2f4f4f">for

flooding and discovering marine fossils in the Taihang Mountains
(hundreds of kilometres from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo developed a

also adopted the theory of gradual regional climate change over time

Yu Hao's architectural works would be little known, as would the
inventor of the movable type printing press, Bi Sheng (990-1051).
Shen's contemporary Su Song (1020-1101) was also a brilliant
polymatician, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star
charts, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise on botany, zoology,
mineralogy and metallurgy, and had a large astronomical clock tower
erected in Kaifeng city in 1088. His clock tower featured a mechanism

Buridan and Nicole Oresme began to reinterpret parts of Aristotle's

(1707-1783), Mikhail Lomonosov (1711-1765) and Jean le Rond
d'Alembert (1717-1783), epitomised by Denis Diderot's <font color="#dcdcdc">Encyclopédie
of </font>1751-1772. The influence of this process was not limited to
science and technology, but also affected philosophy (Immanuel Kant,

Voltaire), and <font color="#2f4f4f">the French Revolution of 1789

the synthesis of <font color="#a9a9a9">Darwinian evolution and
Humboldt's biogeography </font>in the late 19th and early 20th

microbiology and soil science - particularly <font color="#dcdcdc">the

particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In
the 1930s, Arthur Tansley and others began to develop the field of
ecosystem ecology, which combined experimental soil science with
physiological energy concepts and field biology techniques. The
history of ecology in the 20th century is closely linked to the
history of environmental thinking. The Gaia hypothesis, first

Modern sociology emerged in <font color="#dcdcdc">the early 19th

sociologists (e.g. Émile Durkheim) was to use structuralism to

Weber was concerned about the modernisation of society through the
concept of rationalisation, which <font color="#556b2f">he believed
trapped individuals in the 'iron cage' of </font>rational thought.
Some sociologists, such as Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois, made
more use of micro-sociological, qualitative analyses. This
micro-level approach played an important role in American sociology,
and the theories of George Herbert Mead and his student Herbert
Blumer led to the creation of the symbolic interactionist approach to

&quot;functional&quot;. This approach of structural functionalism was
challenged in the 1960s, when sociologists began to see it as a
justification for <font color="#2f4f4f">the inequalities of the
</font>status quo. In response, a <font color="#556b2f">conflict
theory </font>was developed<font color="#556b2f">, </font>based in
part on the philosophy of Karl Marx. Conflict theorists saw society
as an arena in which <font color="#6b8e23">different groups compete
for control of resources</font>. Symbolic interactionism also became
central to sociological thinking. Erving Goffman saw social
interaction as a theatrical performance in which individuals prepare
'behind the scenes' and try to control their audience through
impression management. Although these theories are prominent in
sociological thought today, there are other approaches such as

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 63</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Much of the study of the history of
science has been devoted to answering questions about <font color="#a9a9a9">what
science is</font>, how it works and whether there are broad patterns
and trends. Sociology of science in particular has focused on <font color="#dcdcdc">the
ways in which scientists work </font>and has looked closely at the
ways in which they 'produce' and 'construct' scientific knowledge.
Since the 1960s, the general trend in the study of science (sociology
of science and history of science) has been to <font color="#2f4f4f">emphasise
the 'human component' of scientific knowledge </font>and to
de-emphasise the view that scientific knowledge is self-evident,
value-free and context-free. The field of science and technology
studies, which overlaps with, and often is also related to, the
history of science, focuses on the social context of science in both
modern and historical times.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Humboldtian science refers to an
early 19th century approach that <font color="#a9a9a9">combined
scientific fieldwork with the sensibilities, ethics and aesthetic
ideals of the Romantic era</font>. It helped create a discipline
separate from natural history, provided the basis for ecology and was
inspired by the scientist, naturalist and explorer <font color="#dcdcdc">Alexander
von Humboldt. </font>Later, 19th century positivism argued that all
genuine knowledge admits of verification and that all genuine
knowledge presupposes that <font color="#2f4f4f">the only valid
knowledge is scientific.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The mid-20th century saw the
publication of several studies on the role of science in the social
context, starting with <font color="#a9a9a9">Thomas Kuhn's The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962</font>, which opened up
the study of science to new disciplines by arguing that the
development of science was partly sociologically determined and that
<font color="#dcdcdc">positivism did not explain the actual
interactions and strategies of the human participants in science</font>.
As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science can be viewed in a more
nuanced way, for example through <font color="#2f4f4f">competing
paradigms or conceptual systems within </font>a broader context that
includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes beyond
science. &quot;Partly through selection and partly through
distortion, scientists of earlier eras are implicitly presented as
having worked on the same fixed problems and according to the same
fixed canons that the latest revolution in scientific theory and
method made seem scientific.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Other studies, such as Jerome Ravetz
1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems, referred to the
role of the scientific community <font color="#a9a9a9">as a social
structure </font>in the acceptance or rejection of (objective)
scientific knowledge.<font color="#dcdcdc">The scientific war of the
</font>1990s was particularly influenced by French philosophers who
denied or seemed to deny the objectivity of science in general. They
also illustrated the differences between the idealised model of pure
science and actual scientific practice; while <font color="#2f4f4f">Scientism</font>,
which revived the positivist approach, saw in precise measurement and
rigorous calculation a basis on which to definitively <font color="#556b2f">resolve
enduring metaphysical and moral disputes</font>. More recently,
however, some leading critical theorists have acknowledged that their
postmodern deconstructions have sometimes been counterproductive and
provide intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno
Latour noted that &quot;dangerous extremists use the same social
constructionist argument to destroy hard-won evidence that could save
our lives&quot;. Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this
field called scientific research? Is it enough to say that we didn't

like Tamagotchi, and therefore inspired by Tamagotchi's cute and
rounded design. The small screen size (<font color="#2f4f4f">16 x 16

with easily recognisable shapes. Many of the early Digimon characters
- including <font color="#556b2f">Tyrannomon</font>, the first

</font>Many other designs were created by <font color="#a0522d">Kenji

&quot;X-Antibody&quot; creatures and the Digimon trading card game.
Watanabe was inspired by <font color="#228b22">American </font>comic<font color="#228b22">

&quot;<font color="#556b2f">Digivolution&quot;</font>, which <font color="#6b8e23">changes

</font>series: Digimon Adventure, its sequel <font color="#dcdcdc">Digimon
Adventure 02</font>, Digimon Tamers, Digimon Frontier, Digimon Data
Squad and Digimon Fusion. While the first two series are set in the
<font color="#2f4f4f">same fictional universe, the </font>third,
fourth, fifth and sixth series are each set in their own unique
world. Each series is broadly based on the original <font color="#556b2f">plot</font>,
but with elements added to make them unique. In Tamers, however, the
Adventure universe is referred to as a commercial enterprise - in
Japanese it is a trading card game, and in English dubbing it is a
series within a series. It also features a character from the
Adventure universe. In addition, both series have spawned various
films. Digimon continue to be popular, with new card series, video
games and films being produced and released: new card series include
Eternal Courage, Hybrid Warriors, Generations and Operation X; the
video game Digimon Rumble Arena 2; and previously unreleased films
Revenge of Diaboromon, Runaway Locomon, Battle of Adventurers and
Island of Lost Digimon. <font color="#6b8e23">On 3 January </font>2005,

Digimon television series</font>, which began airing on <font color="#dcdcdc">March
7, 1999 </font><font color="#2f4f4f">in Japan </font>on Fuji TV and
Kids Station and on <font color="#556b2f">August 14, 1999 in </font>the
United States on Fox Kids, dubbed by Saban Entertainment for the
North American English-language version. It is based on a group of
seven children who, while at summer camp, <font color="#6b8e23">travel
to a digital world </font>inhabited by creatures called
&quot;DigiDestined&quot; (Chosen Children in the Japanese version)
and learn that they have been chosen to save both the digital and
real worlds from evil. Each child was given a <font color="#a0522d">Digivice</font>,
which chose them to be transported to DigiWorld, and assigned to be
paired with a Digimon companion, such as Tai Agumon and Matt Gabumon.
The children are assisted by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai,
who helps them through a hologram. The <font color="#228b22">Digivix
</font>help their Digimon allies to digivolve into stronger beings in
times of danger. Digimon usually attain higher forms when their human
counterparts find themselves in dangerous situations, such as
fighting evil forces in their Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon Champion
forms. Later, each character found a human crest for himself: Tai the
emblem of Courage, Matt the emblem of Friendship, Sora the emblem of
Love, Izzy the emblem of Knowledge, Mimi the emblem of Sincerity, Joe
the emblem of Reliability, T.K. the emblem of Hope and later Kari the
emblem of Light, which allowed their Digimon to digitally evolve into
their Ultimate forms. The group consisted of the <font color="#191970">original
seven characters </font>Taichi &quot;Tai&quot; Kamiya, Yamato &quot;Matt&quot;
Ishida, Sora Takenouchi, Koushiro &quot;Izzy&quot; Izumi, Mimi
Tachikawa, Joe Kido, and Takeru &quot;T.K.&quot; Takaishi. Later in

Digimon series </font>is a direct continuation of the first, and
started on <font color="#dcdcdc">2 April 2000</font>. Three years
later, when most of the original DigiDestines were already
<font color="#2f4f4f">fourteen-year-olds </font>in high school, the
world of Digimon was supposed to be safe and peaceful. But a <font color="#556b2f">new
evil </font>has emerged in the form of the Digimon <font color="#6b8e23">Emperor</font>,
who, unlike the previous enemies, is human, just like the
DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has <font color="#a0522d">enslaved
the Digimon </font>with Dark Rings and Control Circles, making normal
Digivolution somehow impossible. However, five set-digi-eggs with
engraved emblems had been assigned to the three new DigiDestined,
along with T.K. and Kari, the two previous DigiDestined in the
series. This new evolutionary process, called Armor Digivolution,
will help the new DigiDestined to overcome the evil lurking in the
digital world. Eventually, the DigiDestined will defeat the Digimon
Emperor, better known on Earth as Ken Ichijouji, only through the
great sacrifice of Ken's own Digimon, Wormmon. Just when things were
thought to be settled, new Digimon enemies, made from deactivated
Control Spires, begin to appear and cause trouble in Digworld. To
make up for his past mistakes, Ken <font color="#228b22">joins the
DigiDestines</font>, being a DigiDestine himself, and his partner
Wormmon is resurrected to fight them. Soon they are rescuing
countries like <font color="#191970">France and Australia </font>from
their control spheres and defeating MaloMyotismon (BelialVamdemon), a
digitally evolved form of Myotismon (Vamdemon) from the previous
series. They stop evil from destroying two worlds, and in the end,
every person on Earth gets their own <font color="#8b0000">Digimon

Digimon series, which </font>began airing on <font color="#dcdcdc">April
1, 2001</font>, is largely set in the &quot;real world&quot;, where
the Adventure and Adventure 02 series are television shows, and where
<font color="#2f4f4f">Digimon toys </font>(based on real objects)
become a key element in empowering the real Digimon who appear in
this world. The plot revolves around three tamperers, Takato Matsuki,
Rika Nonaka and Henry Wong. It began when Takato created his own
Digimon companion <font color="#556b2f">by slipping a mysterious blue
card through a card reader, which </font>then became the D-power.
Guilmon takes shape from Takato's sketches <font color="#6b8e23">as
the new Digimon </font>(Tamers' only human connection to the
Adventure series is Ryo Akiyama, a character who appeared in some
Digimon video games and who appeared in some parts of the Adventure
story). Some of the changes in this series include the way the
Digimon are digivolved with the introduction of
Biomerge-Digivolution, and the way their &quot;Digivics&quot; work.
In this series, Tamperers can <font color="#a0522d">slide playing
cards through their &quot;Digivics</font>&quot; and give their
Digimon partners certain advantages, such as in card games. This is
called &quot;<font color="#228b22">Digi-Modify</font>&quot; (Card
Slash in Japanese). The same process was often used to digivolve
digimon, but as usual, emotions play a big role in the digivolving
process. Unlike the two seasons that preceded it and most of the
seasons that followed, Digimon Tamers takes a darker and more
realistic approach to its story, including Digimon who do not
reincarnate after their deaths, and more complex character
development in the original Japanese-language version. The anime has
become controversial over the decade, and there has been debate about
how appropriate this series really is for its &quot;target audience&quot;,
especially <font color="#191970">given the Lovecraftian nature of the
final arc.</font> In the English dub, the dialogue is lighter,
although still not as much as in the earlier series.</p>

</font><font color="#dcdcdc">Digimon series, which </font>began <font color="#2f4f4f">on
April 7, 2002</font>, departs radically from the previous three
series by focusing on a new and very different evolution, <font color="#556b2f">Spirit
Evolution</font>, in which human characters use <font color="#6b8e23">their
D-Tectors </font>(this series' Digivice) to transform into a special
Digimon called <font color="#a0522d">Legendary Warriors, a </font>departure
from the usual formula of having digital companions. After receiving
unusual phone messages from Ophanimon (one of the three dominant
Digimon along with Seraphim and Cherubim), Takuya Kanbara, Koji
Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto, Tommy Himi and Koichi Kimura
go to the subway station and take a train to the digital world.
Summoned by Ophanimon, the Digidestined realize they must find the
Ten Legendary Spirits and stop the forces of Cherubimon from
physically destroying the digital world. After finding the ten
legendary warrior spirits and defeating Mercurymon, Grumblemon,
Ranamon and Arbormon, they eventually end up fighting Cherubimon in
the hope of thwarting his attempt to rule the digital world. After
defeating Cherubimon, the Digidestined face an even greater challenge
in trying to stop the royal knights - Dynasmon and Crusadermon - from
destroying the digital world and using the information they have
gathered to revive the digital world's original ruler, the tyrannical
Lucemon. In the end, the Digidestined fail to stop <font color="#228b22">Lucemon
from </font>resurrecting, but they do manage to stop him from
escaping into the real world. In the final battle, all the legendary
spirits the Digidestined have gathered so far unite to create
Susanoomon. With this new form, the digidestined will be able to
effectively defeat Lucemon and save the digital world. Overall,
Frontier is much lighter in tone than Tamers, but still darker than
Adventure and Adventure 02.</p>

break, the </font><font color="#dcdcdc">fifth </font>Digimon series
started on <font color="#2f4f4f">2 April 2006</font>. Like Frontier,
Savers is unrelated to the previous series and also marks a new
beginning for the Digimon series, as <font color="#556b2f">the
characters and storyline were radically changed </font>to reach a
wider audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by <font color="#6b8e23">members
of the D.A.T.S. (&quot;Digital Accident Tactics Squad&quot;).
</font>D.<font color="#6b8e23">A.T.S. is an </font>organisation
created to hide the existence of the digital world and digital
monsters from the rest of humanity and to secretly solve all
digital-monster-related incidents on Earth. Later, D.A.T.S. becomes
involved in a massive conflict between Earth and the digital world,
initiated by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, who
is determined to exploit the digital world. The English version was
dubbed by Studiopolis and premiered on Toon Disney's Jetix on October
1, 2007. The digital revolution in Data Squad requires the activation
of the human DNA (&quot;Digital Natural Ability&quot; in the English
version and &quot;Digisoul&quot; in the Japanese version), a strong
empathy for digital monsters and the will to succeed. &quot;Digimon
Savers&quot; also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst
Mode, which is effectively a higher level than Mega (previously the
strongest form a digimon could take). Like Tamers before it, the plot
has a dark tone throughout the story, and the anime was originally
aimed at an older audience in Japan, consisting of late teens and
twenty-somethings <font color="#228b22">aged 16-21. As </font>a
result, Studiopolis dubbed the anime in Jetix, which had much more
editing, alterations, censorship and cut footage, and because the
anime had been edited and localised for a Western American audience,
like previous series, and because the English dubbing standard was
mainly aimed at younger <font color="#191970">children </font><font color="#8b0000">aged
6-10, </font>and because it had a lower TV Y7-FV rating than previous
dubs. This included Americanized names and American surnames for the
Japanese characters, as well as much more Americanization (Marcus
Damon instead of Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining, and
more edits similar to those often made by 4Kids (such as removing
Japanese text for cultural streamlining). Despite all this, the
setting was still in Japan and the characters in the dub were
Japanese. This series was the first to show Japanese cultural
concepts (such as manju) unfamiliar to American audiences, which were
left uncut and used in the English dub. Despite strict censorship and
English dubbing aimed at young children, some Digimon attacks named
after real weapons, such as RizeGreymon's three-headed revolver, were
not edited and used in English dubbing. <font color="#483d8b">Well Go
USA </font>released it on DVD instead of Disney. The North American
English dub was televised in the US on Jetix and in Canada on the
Family Channel.</p>

confirmed a new sixth Digimon title, the official name of which was
revealed in the June issue of Shueishan V Jump magazine: Digimon Xros
Wars. It began airing in Japan on TV Asahi from <font color="#dcdcdc">6

series, with <font color="#2f4f4f">a younger and lighter tone
</font>throughout the story <font color="#2f4f4f">than </font>series
one, two and four. The story follows a boy named<font color="#556b2f">
Mikey Kudō </font>(Taiki Kudo in Japanese) who ends up in a digital
world with his friends, where they meet Shoutmon and his Digimon
friends. Mikey uses a digital device known as the Fusion Loader (Xros
Loader in Japanese) and is able to combine <font color="#6b8e23">several
Digimon </font>together to increase his powers. Shoutmon is the usual
core of the combination, and uses a technique known as &quot;DigiFuse&quot;
(Digi-Xros in Japanese). Forming the Fusion Fighters (Team Xros Heart
in Japanese), Mikey, Shoutmon and their friends travel across the
digital world to free it from the evil Bagra army, led by Bagramon
(Lord Bagra in English), and Midnight, a shadowy group led by
AxeKnightmon and fronted by Nene before she joined the Fusion
Fighters. Fusion Fighters will also face off against <font color="#a0522d">Blue
Flare</font>, led by Christopher Aonuma (Kiriha Anouma in Japan). The
second arc of Xros Wars was subtitled The Evil Death Generals and the
Seven Kingdoms. In it, the main cast changed and got a new wardrobe,
while Angie (Akari in Japan) and Jeremy (Zenjiro in Japan) stayed in
the human world, leaving Mikey, Christopher and Nene as the main
characters to face the Seven Death Generals of the Bagra Army and
AxeKnightmon's new pawn: Nene's brother Ewan (Yuu in Japan). A new
evolution called Super Digivolution was introduced at the end of the
first arc. The <font color="#228b22">English dubbed version of the

more closely; sometimes the comics dealt with themes not covered in

in the English adaptations of TV series and films (such as Ryo's
story or the <font color="#6b8e23">films </font>that remained unaired

from Digimon Magazine, which returned to printing translated German

been criticised for a number of reasons. The company's <font color="#dcdcdc">customer
satisfaction </font><font color="#2f4f4f">is often among the lowest

</font>history of <font color="#556b2f">violating net neutrality
policies</font>, and despite Comcast's commitment to <font color="#6b8e23">a
narrow </font>definition of net neutrality, critics favor a
definition that excludes the distinction between Comcast's private
network services and the rest of the Internet. Critics also point to
the <font color="#a0522d">lack of competition in most of Comcast's
service area</font>; there is little competition among cable
providers. Given Comcast's bargaining power as a major Internet
service provider, some suspect that Comcast could use paid peering
agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds.
Comcast's ownership of both content production (<font color="#228b22">NBCUniversal</font>)
and content distribution (as an ISP) has raised competition concerns.
These and other problems led The Consumerist magazine to name Comcast

It sought to find out why the company has been so widely criticized
by customers, the media and even its own employees. The series argued
that part of the problem is internal and that Comcast employees are
putting up with unreasonable corporate policies. According to the
report, &quot;<font color="#a0522d">customer service </font>has been
replaced by an obsession with sales; there are too few technicians,
while technical support is poorly trained; and internal fragmentation
is holding the company back.&quot; The broadside, written by an

</font>2015, a customer named Ricardo Brown received an invoice from
Comcast changing his name <font color="#dcdcdc">to &quot;Asshole
Brown&quot;</font>. Brown's wife Lisa believed that a Comcast
employee changed the name in response to the Browns' request to
cancel their cable service. He was denied cancellation unless he paid
a $60 fee and was instead referred to a conservation specialist.
Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing the
matter to the attention of numerous company customer service agents,
explaining that Ricardo is the customer's legal name, so the Browns
turned to consumer advocate <font color="#2f4f4f">Christopher
Elliott. </font>Elliott published <font color="#556b2f">the facts of
the case and a copy of the invoice on </font>his blog. Soon after,
Elliott contacted Comcast, and Comcast offered the Browns an apology,
a <font color="#6b8e23">$60 </font>refund, and <font color="#a0522d">promised
to track down and fire the responsible employee. </font>The Browns
instead asked for a full refund for their negative experience, and
Comcast agreed to refund the family for the last <font color="#228b22">two

the next two years of service free of charge. Comcast released a
statement explaining, &quot;We have spoken with our customer and
apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name
change. We have zero tolerance for such disrespectful behavior and
are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened.
We are working with our client to rectify the matter and will take
appropriate action to prevent this from happening again.&quot;

</font>TB usually affects <font color="#556b2f">the lungs, but it </font>can
also affect other parts of the body. Most infections have no symptoms
and are therefore called <font color="#6b8e23">latent </font>tuberculosis.
Around <font color="#a0522d">10% of </font>latent infections progress
to active disease, which if left untreated kills around <font color="#228b22">half
of </font>those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are
chronic cough with bloody sputum, <font color="#191970">fever</font>,
night sweats and weight loss. The historical term &quot;<font color="#8b0000">consumption</font>&quot;
was coined to describe weight loss. Infection of other organs can
cause a wide range of symptoms.</p>

other types of TB. These are collectively referred to as

the <font color="#a9a9a9">granulomatous </font>inflammatory diseases.
Macrophages, T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and fibroblasts combine to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Slow progress has led to
frustration, expressed by <font color="#a9a9a9">Mark Dybul, </font>Executive
Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria:
&quot;We have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and a public health
threat on the planet, but we are not doing it.&quot; Several
international organisations are working to increase transparency of
treatment, and a growing number of countries have introduced
mandatory reporting of cases to governments, although compliance is
often poor. Commercial care providers can sometimes over-prescribe
second-line drugs and complementary therapies, fuelling calls for
<font color="#dcdcdc">further regulation</font>. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Brazilian
</font>government<font color="#2f4f4f">'s </font>provision of
universal TB treatment reduces this problem<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font>
On the other hand, the reduction in TB infections is not necessarily
related to the number of programmes aimed at reducing infection
rates, but may be linked to improvements in the education, income and
health of the population. According to <font color="#556b2f">World
Bank </font>calculations in <font color="#556b2f">2009, the </font>cost
of the disease could exceed USD 150 billion per year in 'high burden'
countries. No progress has been made in eradicating the disease,
which may also be due to a lack of follow-up of patients - as in the
case of 250 million Chinese <font color="#6b8e23">migrants.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">One way to reduce stigma may be to
set up <font color="#a9a9a9">TB clubs </font>where infected people
can share their experiences and offer support, or counselling. Some
studies have shown that TB education programmes are effective in
reducing stigma and can therefore <font color="#dcdcdc">increase
treatment adherence. Nevertheless, as </font>of 2010, no studies have
been conducted on the relationship between stigma reduction and
mortality, and similar interventions to reduce AIDS-related stigma
have had limited effectiveness. Some have argued that <font color="#556b2f">stigma
</font>is worse than <font color="#6b8e23">the disease </font>and
that <font color="#a0522d">health care providers </font>may
inadvertently reinforce stigma because people with TB are often
perceived as <font color="#228b22">difficult or otherwise
undesirable. A </font>better understanding of <font color="#191970">the
