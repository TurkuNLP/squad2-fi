<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">William Penn
</font>founded the city in 1682 as the capital of the colony of
Pennsylvania. Philadelphia played an important role in the American
Revolution, <font color="#dcdcdc">hosting the meeting of the founding
fathers of the United States, </font>who signed the Declaration of
Independence in 1776 and the Constitution in 1787. Philadelphia was
one of the nation's capitals during the Revolutionary War, and served
as <font color="#2f4f4f">the temporary capital of the United States
</font>while Washington was under construction. In the 19th century,
Philadelphia became a major industrial centre and railroad hub,
growing with the arrival of European immigrants. It became a prime
destination for African Americans during the Great Migration, and its
population exceeded two million by <font color="#556b2f">1950</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Following similar changes in the
country's economy after 1960, Philadelphia experienced a loss of
manufacturing businesses and jobs to lower-taxed areas of the United
States and often overseas. As a result, Philadelphia's economic base,
which had traditionally been <font color="#a9a9a9">manufacturing,
</font>weakened significantly. In addition, the consolidation of
several American industries (notably retail, financial services and
health care) reduced the number of companies headquartered in
Philadelphia. The economic impact of these changes would reduce
Philadelphia's tax base and local government resources. Philadelphia
struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic
changes, which were accompanied by a significant demographic shift as
wealthier residents moved to nearby <font color="#dcdcdc">suburbs </font>and
more <font color="#2f4f4f">immigrants </font>moved into the city. In
fact, the city was approaching bankruptcy <font color="#556b2f">in
the late 1980s</font>. The revival began in the 1990s, when
gentrification turned many parts of the city around and reversed
decades of population decline.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The region's many universities and

city has developed into an educational and economic hub. With a gross
domestic product of <font color="#a9a9a9">$388 billion, </font>Philadelphia
ranks ninth among world cities and <font color="#dcdcdc">fourth </font>in
the country. Philadelphia is the centre of economic activity in
Pennsylvania, home to <font color="#2f4f4f">seven </font>Fortune 1000
companies. Philadelphia's skyline is growing, with several nationally
significant skyscrapers. Known for its arts, culture and history, the
city attracted more than <font color="#556b2f">39 million </font>domestic
tourists in 2013. Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals
than any other American city, and Fairmount Park is the largest
landscaped urban park in the world. The city's 67 National Historic
Landmarks helped generate $10 billion in tourism. Philadelphia is the
birthplace of the <font color="#6b8e23">US Marines and is </font>also
home to many of the first buildings in the United States, including
the first library (1731), the first hospital (1751) and medical

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Before the arrival of Europeans in
the Philadelphia area, the Lenape Indians (Delaware Indians) lived in
the village of Shackamaxon. <font color="#a9a9a9">The Lenape are a
</font>Native American tribe and a First Nations government. Also
called Delaware Indians, their historic territory was in the Delaware
River watershed, western Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley. In
the 1700s, expanding European settlements pushed most of the Lenape
out of their Delaware Indian homelands, and they also suffered losses
in intertribal conflicts. Lenape communities were weakened by new
diseases, mainly <font color="#dcdcdc">smallpox, </font>and violent
conflicts with Europeans. The Iroquois sometimes fought against the
Lenape. The surviving Lenape migrated west <font color="#556b2f">to
the upper Ohio River.</font> The American Revolutionary War and
American independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the US
government sent most of the remaining Lenape in the eastern United
States to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding
areas) under a policy of Indian Removal. In the 2000s, most of the
Lenape now live in the US state of <font color="#6b8e23">Oklahoma,
</font>with some communities also living in Wisconsin, Ontario
(Canada) and their traditional homelands.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Europeans arrived in the Delaware
Valley in the early 1600s, and the first settlements were established
by the <font color="#a9a9a9">Dutch, </font>who in 1623 built <font color="#dcdcdc">Fort
Nassau </font>on the Delaware River across the Schuylkill River from
present-day Brooklawn, New Jersey. <font color="#2f4f4f">The Dutch
</font>considered the entire Delaware River valley part of their New
Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers, led by renegade
Dutchmen, established a New Sweden colony at Fort Christina (now
Wilmington, Delaware) and quickly spread throughout the valley. In
1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks, who militarily
defeated the English colony of Maryland. In 1648, the Dutch built
Fort Beversreede on the west bank of Delaware, south of the
Schuylkill, near Philadelphia's present-day Eastwick neighborhood, to
reassert their dominance in the area. The Swedes responded by
building the fortress of Nya Korsholm, which was named Uuseks
Korsholm after a town in what is now Finland. In 1655, a Dutch
expedition led by Peter Stuyvesant, Governor-General of New
Netherland, took control of the Swedish colony and ended its claim to
independence, although the Swedish and Finnish settlers still had
their own militia, religion and court, and considerable autonomy
under Dutch rule. The English conquered the colony of New Netherland
in <font color="#556b2f">1664</font>, but the situation did not
really change until 1682, when the territory was incorporated into
William Penn's Pennsylvania charter.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1681, Charles II of England
granted <font color="#a9a9a9">William Penn a </font>charter for the
colony of Pennsylvania, which later became the Pennsylvania Colony,
as partial repayment of a debt. Despite the royal charter, Penn
bought land from the local <font color="#dcdcdc">Lenape </font>to be
on good terms with the Indians and ensure peace for his colony. Penn
made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany at Shackamaxon,
under an elm tree in what is now Fishtown. Penn named the town
Philadelphia, which is Greek for brotherly love (from philos, &quot;love&quot;
or &quot;friendship&quot;, and adelphos, &quot;brother&quot;). <font color="#2f4f4f">As
a Quaker, </font>Penn had experienced religious persecution and
wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could freely practice
their religion. This tolerance, far greater than in most other
colonies, led to better relations with local indigenous tribes and
contributed to Philadelphia's rapid growth as the most important city
in America. Penn planned a city on the Delaware River that would
serve as a port and administrative centre. Hoping to make
Philadelphia more like an English country town rather than a city,
Penn laid out the roads <font color="#556b2f">in a grid pattern to
space </font>houses and businesses apart and to provide areas for
gardens and orchards. The town's residents did not follow Penn's
plans, as they crowded in along the Delaware River and the harbour
and subdivided and resold their plots. Before Penn left Philadelphia
for the last time, he issued a charter in <font color="#6b8e23">1701
</font>establishing it as a city. It became an important commercial
center, poor at first but with tolerable living conditions by the
1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve the
city's services and established new ones, including a fire
department, a library, and one of the first hospitals in the American
colonies.</p>

central location in the colonies made it a natural hub for American
revolutionaries. By 1750, Philadelphia had overtaken Boston to become
the largest city and busiest port in British America and the second
largest city in the British Empire after London. The city hosted the
First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary War, the
Second Continental Congress, where the <font color="#a9a9a9">Declaration

Philadelphia in <font color="#a9a9a9">1799</font>, and the federal
government moved to Washington in 1800, when the White House and
Capitol were completed. The city remained the largest in the young
nation at the turn of the 19th century, with a population of nearly
50,000. The city was an economic and cultural centre. Before 1800,
its free black community founded the <font color="#dcdcdc">African
</font>Methodist <font color="#dcdcdc">Church </font>(AME), the first
independent black denomination in the country, and the first black
Episcopal church. The free black community also established many
schools for its children with the help of Quakers. <font color="#2f4f4f">New

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Philadelphia in the 19th century was
home to a wide range of industries and businesses, the largest of
which was <font color="#a9a9a9">textiles</font>. Major companies in
the 19th and early 20th centuries included Baldwin Locomotive Works,
William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the
Pennsylvania Railroad. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1876, </font>the
Centennial Exposition, the first official world's fair in the United
States, celebrated industry and the centennial of the United States.
Settlers, mostly <font color="#2f4f4f">Irish and Germans, </font>settled
in Philadelphia and the surrounding areas. Population growth in the
surrounding neighborhoods led to the Act of Consolidation of 1854,
which expanded the boundaries of the City of Philadelphia from the
current two square miles of Center City <font color="#556b2f">to
</font>about <font color="#556b2f">130 square miles </font>in

the destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing <font color="#556b2f">the
Great Famine of the </font>1840s. Housing was built for them on the
south side of South Street, and later settlers occupied it. They
established a network of Catholic churches and schools and ruled the
Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish and anti-Catholic nativist
riots had broken out in Philadelphia in 1844. In the second half of
the century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy settled
in the city, as did African-Americans from the southern United
States. <font color="#6b8e23">Between 1880 and 1930, </font>Philadelphia's

Philadelphia was known as &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">corrupt and

<font color="#dcdcdc">Republican </font>political machine. The first
major reform came in <font color="#2f4f4f">1917</font>, when outrage
over a police murder led to the reduction of the Philadelphia City
Council from two chambers to one. In July 1919, Philadelphia was one
of more than 36 industrial cities nationally affected by racial
riots, pitting whites against blacks during the post-World War I Red
Summer, when recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs. In the
1920s, the public flouting of prohibition laws, mob violence and
police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of US
Marine Brigadier General Smedley Butler as Director of Public Safety,
but political pressure prevented long-term success in the fight
against crime and corruption.</p>

industrial restructuring, leading to the <font color="#dcdcdc">loss
of many middle-class union jobs</font>. In addition, suburbanisation
had drawn many wealthier residents away to outlying towns along the
railways and to newer housing. Neighborhood revitalization and
gentrification began in the late 1970s and continues into the 2000s,
with much of the development occurring in the Center City and
University City areas. After many of the older manufacturers and
businesses left Philadelphia or went out of business, the city began
to attract <font color="#2f4f4f">service businesses </font>and market
itself more aggressively <font color="#556b2f">as a tourist

Center City. Historic sites such as Independence National Historical

features long, straight streets running east-west and north-south in
a grid pattern. The original urban plan was designed to allow easy
movement and to separate residential buildings in an open area that
would help prevent the spread of fires. <font color="#dcdcdc">The
Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers </font>served as early boundaries
between which the city's early street plan remained. In addition,

Publick Square (Franklin Square), Northwest Square (Logan Square),
Southwest Square (Rittenhouse Square) and Southeast Square

structures and bunkers, as described in the story <font color="#556b2f">The
Death Of PCF 43. </font>Firing heavily from the river banks with
small arms fire, Kerry &quot;directed the units to turn the beach and
attack the Viet Cong positions&quot; and &quot;expertly directed&quot;
his boat's fire, which caused the enemy to flee, while coordinating
the transfer of ninety South Vietnamese soldiers to shore (according
to the original citation signed by <font color="#6b8e23">Admiral
Zumwalt</font>). As Kerry's boat moved a short distance upriver, a
B-40 rocket launch hit it; Kerry charged the enemy positions, and as
his boat crashed ashore, a Viet Cong insurgent armed with a rocket
launcher emerged from the cobwebs and fled. While the boat's gunner
opened fire and wounded the Vietnamese in the leg, and as other boats
approached and offered covering fire, Kerry jumped from the boat in
pursuit of the Vietnamese insurgent, killing him and seizing his
loaded rocket launcher.</p>

for Truth (SBVT, later renamed <font color="#556b2f">Swift Vets and

included several members of Kerry's unit, including Larry Thurlow,
who commanded the Swift boat that ran alongside Kerry's unit, and
Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat. The campaign inspired
the widely used political slur &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">swiftboating&quot;,

opposition to the war. Marine Jack Smith read a statement explaining
why the veterans returned their military awards to the government.
For more than two hours, <font color="#2f4f4f">nearly a thousand

given him to throw</font>. As Kerry threw his medal over the fence,

originally projected to defeat the Republican candidate, former state
representative Paul W. Cronin, and conservative Democrat Roger P.
Durkin, who was running <font color="#a9a9a9">as an independent</font>.
A week after the primaries, a poll showed Kerry <font color="#dcdcdc">26
percentage points </font>ahead of Cronin. His campaign called for a
national health insurance plan, reduced prescription drugs for the
unemployed, <font color="#2f4f4f">a jobs program to clean up the
Merrimack River </font>and rent control in Lowell and Lawrence. But a
major obstacle was the district's leading newspaper, the <font color="#556b2f">conservative
</font>The Sun. The paper wrote an editorial against him. It also
published critical news stories about his out-of-state donations and
&quot;carpet-bagging&quot; since he had only moved to the district in
April. Later released &quot;Watergate&quot; tapes from the Nixon
White House showed that Kerry's winning the nomination had attracted
the personal attention of <font color="#6b8e23">President Nixon</font>.

election Durkin withdrew and endorsed Cronin, hoping Kerry would
lose. In a poll taken a week earlier, Kerry had been 10 percentage
points ahead of Cronin and Dukin 13%. In the final days of the
campaign, Kerry felt it was &quot;slipping away&quot; and Cronin
emerged victorious with <font color="#a9a9a9">110,970 </font>votes

Kerry complained in a letter to supporters that &quot;for two weeks
[The Sun] called me un-American, an anti-war agitator for the new
left, unpatriotic and branded me in every other way possible as 'un'
and 'anti'. It's hard to believe that one newspaper could be so
influential, but they were.&quot; He later felt that <font color="#6b8e23">his

the House vote on the $14 million Contra aid package, but Kerry said:
&quot;I am willing..... to take a risk in an effort to test the

behaviour is to the left of the Senate Democratic caucus. During the
2004 presidential election, conservative groups and the Bush campaign
portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal, and the Bush campaign often
pointed out that in <font color="#a9a9a9">2003 </font>Kerry was rated
the best liberal in the Senate by the<font color="#dcdcdc"> National
Journal.</font> However, this rating was based only on legislative
votes over the past year. In fact, according to National Journal,
Kerry is the <font color="#2f4f4f">11th most liberal </font>member of
the Senate in terms of career voting record. By most analyses, Kerry
is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic
senator. Kerry has stated his opposition to privatizing Social
Security, his support for abortion rights for adult women and minors,
his support for same-sex marriage, his opposition to the death
penalty except for terrorists, his support for most gun control
legislation, and his general support for trade agreements. Kerry
supported <font color="#556b2f">the North American Free Trade
Agreement </font>and China's preferential status, but opposed <font color="#6b8e23">the

said <font color="#a9a9a9">on 9 October </font>2002: 'I will vote to
give the President of the United States the authority to use force,
if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that the
lethal arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his possession is a
real and serious threat to our security'. Bush invoked this
resolution when ordering the invasion of Iraq in <font color="#dcdcdc">2003.
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">On 23 January 2003, </font>Kerry gave a
speech at Georgetown University in which he said: &quot;We must
disarm <font color="#556b2f">Saddam Hussein </font>without question.
He is a brutal and murderous dictator who runs a repressive regime
and poses a particularly serious threat because he is constantly
prone to misjudgment. The threat that Saddam Hussein has weapons of
mass destruction is therefore real.&quot; However, Kerry warned that
the administration should use all diplomatic means before going to
war: &quot;Mr. President, don't rush to war, take the time to build a
coalition, because winning a war is not hard, winning peace is hard.&quot;</p>

Kerry then won landslide victories in Nevada and Wisconsin. Kerry
thus won the Democratic nomination for President of the United States

he announced his choice of John Edwards as his running mate.
Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who was Kerry's campaign adviser in

after the election Kerry had said he wished he had never chosen
Edwards and that the two had since stopped talking to each other.
Kerry then refused to respond to Shrum's claim on ABC's This Week,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 2004, the Forbes 400 estimated
that Teresa Heinz Kerry had a net worth of <font color="#a9a9a9">$750
million</font>. However, estimates have often varied, ranging from
<font color="#dcdcdc">around $165 million to as much as $3.2 billion</font>,
according to a Los Angeles Times investigation. Whichever figure is
correct, Kerry was the wealthiest US senator while in the Senate.
Heinz aside, Kerry is wealthy in his own right and is the beneficiary
of at least four foundations inherited from relatives of the Forbes
family, including his mother <font color="#2f4f4f">Rosemary Forbes
Kerry, </font>who died in <font color="#556b2f">2002. </font>Forbes
magazine (named after the Forbes publishing family, which is not
related to Kerry) estimates that if Kerry were elected, and if the
Heinz family fortune were taken into account, he would have been the
<font color="#6b8e23">third richest </font>US president in history,
adjusted for inflation. The estimate was based on the combined wealth
of Heinz and Kerry, but the couple signed a prenuptial agreement to
keep their assets separate. According to Kerry's 2011 financial
disclosure form, his personal wealth ranges from $230,000,000 to
$320,000,000, including assets of his spouse and dependent children.
This included just over three million dollars worth of assets of the
H.J. Heinz Company, which rose to over six hundred thousand dollars
in 2013 when Berkshire Hathaway announced its intention to buy the
company.</p>

north-western part of </font>Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry.
Most of this area is covered by the <font color="#dcdcdc">Thar
Desert</font>, which extends into neighbouring parts of Pakistan. The
Aravalli Mountains do not intercept the moisture-generating winds of
the southwest monsoon winds from the Arabian Sea, as they are
parallel to the incoming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern
region in the shadow of the rain. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Thar
Desert </font>is sparsely populated; the town of <font color="#556b2f">Jodhpur

to the Thar Desert. There are some large areas of the desert,
including <font color="#6b8e23">Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner
and Nagour</font>. This area is also important from a defence point
of view. <font color="#a0522d">Jodhpur Airbase </font>is the largest
airbase in India and is also home to army and BSF bases<font color="#a0522d">.</font>
Jodhpur also has one civilian airport. The northwestern thornbush

the Aravall. The average <font color="#228b22">annual </font>rainfall
in this area is less than <font color="#228b22">400 mm.</font>
Temperatures can exceed 48 °C in the summer months and fall below
freezing in winter. The areas of Godwar, Marwar, Shekhawat and the
town of Jodhpur are located in the thornbush belt. The River Luni and
its tributaries are the main river basin of Godwar and Marwar
districts, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and flowing
southwest into the large Rann of Kutch wetland in neighbouring
Gujarat. The river is saline downstream and is drinkable only as far
as Balotara in Barmer district. The Ghaggar River, which originates
in Haryana, is an intermittent river that disappears into the sands
of the Thar desert in the northern part of the state and is
considered a remnant of the primitive Saraswati River.</p>

culture is a combination of American, Spanish, Filipino, other
Micronesian islanders and Mexican traditions, with only a few
indigenous pre-Hispanic customs remaining. These influences are
reflected in the local language, music, dance, seafaring, cuisine,
fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks and bayogu), songs and
fashion. During the Spanish colonial period (<font color="#a9a9a9">1668-1898),
</font>most of the population converted to <font color="#556b2f">Roman
Catholicism </font>and religious festivals such as <font color="#6b8e23">Easter

cuisine is largely based on <font color="#a0522d">corn, </font>and
includes tortillas, tamales, atole and chilaquiles, a clear influence
of Spain's trade between Mesoamerica and Asia. The modern Chamorro
language is a <font color="#228b22">Malay-Polynesian </font>language
with many Spanish and Filipino influences. Many Chamorros also have
Spanish surnames because they have converted to Roman Catholic
Christianity and adopted names from the Catálogo alfabético de

inafa'maole. Historian Lawrence Cunningham wrote in 1992: 'In the
Chamorro mind, the <font color="#a0522d">land and its products belong
to everyone</font>. Inafa'maolek, or interdependence, is the core
value of Chamorro culture...'. Inafa'maolek is based on the spirit of
cooperation and sharing. This is the foundation or core around which
everything in Chamorro culture revolves. It is a strong concern for
reciprocity rather than individualism and private property rights.&quot;</p>

that the reptile has no natural predators on the island. The brown

developed by &quot;a syllogistic method of reasoning in which

secondly, of composition, by giving composers different suggestions

that he had a fundamental pedagogical influence on the young Galileo,
his eldest son (cf. <font color="#191970">Coelho</font>, ed. Music
and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei), arguably one of the most
influential empiricists in history. Through his tuning studies,
Vincenzo discovered the truth behind the misunderstood myth of the
'hammers of Pythagoras' (the square of the figures in question
produced the pitch intervals in question, not the actual figures as
was believed), and this and other discoveries that proved the
traditional authorities wrong developed a radically empirical
attitude, passed on to Galileo, which regarded 'experience and proof'
as a necessary condition for valid rational research.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In response to the &quot;continental
rationalism&quot; of the early and mid-16th century, <font color="#a9a9a9">John
Locke </font>(<font color="#dcdcdc">1632-1704</font>), in his <font color="#556b2f">1689
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding
</font>(<font color="#556b2f">1689), put </font>forward the highly
influential view that the only knowledge a human being can have is a
posteriori, i.e. based on experience. Locke is known for his claim
that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a '<font color="#6b8e23">blank
slate</font>', in Locke's words a '<font color="#a0522d">white sheet
of paper</font>' <font color="#228b22">on which the experiences of
the senses are written as the human life progresses.</font> Our
thoughts have two sources: sensations and reflection. In both cases,
a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former
are unanalysed and are divided into primary and secondary properties.
Primary properties are necessary for the object in question to be
what it is. Without certain primary properties, an object would not
be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the order
of its atomic structure. <font color="#191970">If an apple had a
different structure, it would no longer be an apple.</font> Secondary
properties are sensory information that we can perceive from its
primary properties. For example, an apple may be perceived as a
different colour, size and texture, but it is still recognised as an
apple. Primary properties therefore determine what an object
essentially is, while secondary properties determine its
characteristics. Complex ideas combine simple ideas and are divided
into substances, modes and relations. According to Locke, our
knowledge of things is a <font color="#8b0000">perception of ideas
that are in harmony or contradiction with each other, </font>which is
very different from <font color="#483d8b">Descartes' </font>pursuit
of certainty.</p>

things exist only either as a result of being perceived or by virtue

God replaces man by performing the act of perception when man is not
present to perform it.) In his Alciphron, Berkeley argued that all

own principles implicitly contained a rational justification for such

leave it to human instincts, habits, and customs. According to the
extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, which both <font color="#6b8e23">Hume's
and George Berkeley's </font>arguments anticipated, the physical
object is a kind of construct born of our experience. <font color="#a0522d">Phenomenalism
</font>is the view that <font color="#228b22">physical objects,
properties and events (everything that is physical) are reducible to
mental objects, properties and events</font>. Ultimately, only mental
objects, properties, events exist - hence the closely related term
subjective idealism. According to phenomenalist thinking, the visual
experience of a real physical thing is the experience of a particular
set of experiences. Such a set of experiences has a permanence and
coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences to which, for
example, hallucinations belong. As John Stuart Mill put it in <font color="#191970">the
mid-19th century</font>, matter is <font color="#8b0000">'the
permanent possibility of sensation'.</font> Mill's empiricism went
much further than Hume's in another respect: he argued that induction
is necessary for all meaningful knowledge, including mathematics. As

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">According to
Mill's empiricism, </font>therefore, <font color="#dcdcdc">knowledge
</font><font color="#a9a9a9">of any kind is </font>not based on
direct experience but is <font color="#2f4f4f">an inductive inference
from direct experience</font>. The problems that other philosophers
have had with Mill's position focus on the following issues: first,
Mill's formulation encounters difficulties in describing what direct
experience is by distinguishing only between <font color="#556b2f">actual
and possible sensations.</font> This misses some key discussions
about the conditions under which such 'groups of persistent sensory
possibilities' can exist at all. <font color="#6b8e23">Berkeley
</font>placed <font color="#a0522d">God in </font>that gap; the
phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question
unanswered. Ultimately, such a position leads to a version of
subjective idealism, because it fails to recognise a side of
'reality' that goes beyond mere 'sensory possibilities'. Questions
about how floor joists continue to support the floor even though they
are not perceived, how trees continue to grow even though they are
not perceived and touched by human hands, etc. remain unanswered, and
perhaps unanswerable under these conditions. Second, Mill's
formulation leaves open the troubling possibility that '<font color="#228b22">gap-filling
entities </font>are purely possibilities and not realities at all'.
Third, Mill's position, which calls mathematics only another kind of
inductive reasoning, misunderstands mathematics. It fails to take
full account of <font color="#191970">the structure and method of
mathematical science</font><font color="#8b0000">, the products of
which are produced by internally consistent deductive procedures that

phenomenalist </font>phase of post-Hume empiricism <font color="#dcdcdc">came
to an </font>end <font color="#dcdcdc">in the 1940s, by which </font>time
it had become obvious that claims about physical things could not be
translated into claims about actual and potential sensory data. If a
statement about a physical object can be translated into a statement
about sensory information, <font color="#2f4f4f">the former must at
least be deducible from the latter</font>. But it became clear that
there is no finite set of actual and possible sensory data statements
from which we could infer even one physical object statement. Recall
that a reversible or paraphrasal statement must be formulated for
normal observers under normal perceptual conditions. However, there
is no finite set of statements, formulated in <font color="#6b8e23">purely
sensory terms</font>, that can express the satisfaction of the
condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to
phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make
the hypothetical claim that if a doctor were to inspect an observer,
the observer would appear normal to the doctor. But of course the
doctor himself must be the normal observer. If we are to specify the
normality of this doctor by sensory means, we must refer to <font color="#a0522d">a
second doctor </font>who, when examining the sensory organs of the
first doctor, would himself have to possess the sensory information
that a normal observer has when examining the sensory organs of the
subject who is the normal observer. And if we are to specify
sensorially that the second doctor is a normal observer, <font color="#228b22">we
must refer to the third doctor</font>, and so on (see also third

</font><font color="#a9a9a9">and Bertrand Russell (</font><font color="#556b2f">1872-1970</font>)
a powerful tool for rationally reconstructing all scientific
discourse into an ideal, logically complete language, free from the
ambiguities and deformities of natural language. This gave rise, they
believed, to metaphysical pseudo-problems and other conceptual
confusions. Combining Frege's thesis that <font color="#a0522d">all
mathematical truths are logical </font>with the early Wittgensteinian
idea that <font color="#228b22">all logical truths are mere
linguistic tautologies</font>, they arrived at a twofold
classification of all propositions: analytic (a priori) and synthetic
(a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong demarcation
principle between propositions that make sense and those that do not:
the so-called <font color="#191970">verification principle.</font>

meaningless. As a result, <font color="#8b0000">most metaphysical,

</font>and gave Peirce full credit for its legacy, but Peirce later
reacted negatively to the tangents created by the movement and
renamed the idea he originally considered '<font color="#191970">pragmatism'.

</font>(<font color="#dcdcdc">1839-1914) </font>was highly
influential in laying the foundations for the modern empirical
scientific method.Although <font color="#556b2f">Peirce was highly
critical of many elements of Descartes' rationalism</font>, he did
not reject rationalism altogether. In fact, he agreed with the main
ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational
concepts can be meaningful, and the idea that rational concepts
necessarily go beyond the information provided by empirical
observation. <font color="#a0522d">In later years, </font>he even
emphasized the conceptualist side of the debate between strict
empiricism and strict rationalism that was going on at the time,
partly <font color="#228b22">to counterbalance the excesses to which

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Peirce's major achievements included
placing inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning in a
<font color="#a9a9a9">complementary </font>rather than <font color="#dcdcdc">competing
</font>mode, the latter having been the primary trend among educated
people since David Hume wrote <font color="#2f4f4f">a century
</font><font color="#556b2f">earlier</font>. To this Peirce added the
concept of abductive reasoning. The combined three forms of reasoning
serve today as the primary conceptual basis of the empirically based
scientific method. Peirce's approach &quot;presupposes that (1) the
objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characteristics
(properties) of real things do not depend on the things we observe,
and (3) everyone with sufficient experience of real things agrees on
the truth about them&quot;. According to Peirce's doctrine of
fallibilism, <font color="#a0522d">scientific conclusions are always
tentative. The </font>rationality of the scientific method depends
not on the certainty of its conclusions but on <font color="#228b22">its
self-correcting nature</font>: <font color="#191970">by continuing to
apply the method, science can discover and correct its own errors </font>and
thus ultimately lead to the discovery of truth'.</p>

</font>(<font color="#2f4f4f">1903</font>), <font color="#556b2f">Peirce
</font>listed the &quot;three cotary propositions of pragmatism&quot;
(L: cos, cotis whetstone), which he called &quot;the maxims of
pragmatism&quot;, saying that they &quot;set the maxims of pragmatism
on edge&quot;. The first of these he listed was the
peripatetic-sensory perception mentioned above, but he also pointed
out that this connection between sensory perception and intellectual
perception is a two-way street. In other words, it can be taken to
mean that whatever we perceive in the intellect is also initially in
the senses. Thus, <font color="#6b8e23">if theories are theoretical,
so are the senses, </font>and perception itself can be seen as a
species of abductive reasoning, the difference being that it is
beyond control and therefore beyond criticism - in a word,
incorrigible. This in no way contradicts the fallibility and
verifiability of scientific concepts, for only immediate perception<font color="#a0522d">,
in its unique individuality or 'this-ness' </font>- what the
Scholastics called its haecceity - is beyond control and correction.
Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are universal in nature, and
transient sensations find, in another sense, a correction within
them. This notion of perception as abduction has occasionally
received new impetus <font color="#228b22">in AI and cognitive
science research</font>, most recently, for example, with Irvin

James </font>(<font color="#2f4f4f">1842-1910</font>) used the term
&quot;radical empiricism&quot; to describe a branch of his pragmatism

although in fact the two concepts are intertwined in <font color="#a0522d">James's

to exclude the notion that the search for supernatural explanations
for natural phenomena could add any value. James's &quot;<font color="#191970">radical
empiricism</font>&quot; is thus not radical in the context of the
term &quot;empiricism&quot;, but <font color="#8b0000">is instead
quite consistent with the modern use of the term &quot;empirical&quot;</font>.

The </font>role of sensory experience in Dewey's theory is crucial,

Therefore, man adapts his previous experience of things in order to
experiment and test the pragmatic values of that experience. The
value of such experience is measured empirically and scientifically,
and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as tools for
future experiments in both physics and ethics. Thus, ideas retain
their empirical flavour in Dewey's system in the sense that they are
known only after the fact.</p>

idealism manifests itself as skepticism about the possibility of

human ideas - especially <font color="#a0522d">beliefs and values -
shape </font>society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes even
further and asserts that all beings are composed of mind or spirit.

interrelated meanings. It comes from the <font color="#a9a9a9">Greek
</font>word ide (ἰδεῖν), which means &quot;to <font color="#dcdcdc">see</font>&quot;.
The term entered the English language by <font color="#2f4f4f">1743.
In </font>common usage, as in <font color="#556b2f">Woodrow </font>Wilson's
political idealism, it usually refers to the primacy of ideals,
principles, values and goals over concrete reality. Idealists are
understood to represent the world as it could or should be, in
contrast to <font color="#6b8e23">pragmatists </font>who focus on the
world as it currently is. In art, idealism similarly <font color="#a0522d">reinforces

a standard of perfection, as opposed to aesthetic naturalism and

Berkeley </font>are anti-realists of a mind-independent world, while
transcendental idealists like <font color="#2f4f4f">Immanuel Kant </font>are
strongly sceptical of such a world and advocate epistemological
rather than metaphysical idealism. Thus Kant defines idealism as 'the
claim that we can never be sure <font color="#556b2f">whether all our
supposed external experience is merely imaginary</font>'. He argued
that idealism &quot;does not allow us to <font color="#6b8e23">prove
rigorously the </font>reality of external objects. On the contrary,
however, the reality of the object of our inner sense (self and
state) is immediately clear through consciousness.&quot;  Not all
idealists, however, limit what is real or knowable to our immediate
subjective experience. <font color="#a0522d">Objectivist </font>idealists
make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this
world is essentially separate from or ontologically prior to the
mental. Thus Plato and <font color="#228b22">Gottfried Leibniz </font>affirm
a reality beyond our subjective consciousness that is objective and
knowable - a rejection of epistemological idealism - but suggest that
this reality is based on ideal entities, a form of metaphysical
idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of
the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental
abstract forms, while <font color="#191970">for Leibniz </font>they
were proto-mental and concrete monads.</p>

idealistic orientation. The theology of Christian science involves a
kind of idealism: it teaches that <font color="#8b0000">all that

Plato &quot;the earliest exponent of metaphysical objective

perceive it and give it existence through eternal ideas that our

sought to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be considered
idealistic in the modern sense, although the claim of quantum physics
that human consciousness is an immutable and primary condition for

reality would lend more credence to Plato's dualistic position.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hegel certainly seeks to preserve
what he regards as <font color="#a9a9a9">German idealism</font>,
especially Kant's insistence that <font color="#dcdcdc">ethical
reason can and does transcend finite tendencies</font>. For Hegel,
there must be <font color="#2f4f4f">some identity of thought and
being in </font>order for the &quot;subject&quot; (<font color="#556b2f">any
human observer)</font>) to know any perceived &quot;object&quot; (any
<font color="#6b8e23">external entity</font>, possibly even another
human being) at all. According to Hegel's notion of &quot;subject-object
identity&quot;, subject and object both have <font color="#228b22">Spirit
</font>(Hegel's replacement, redefined, non-supernatural &quot;God&quot;)
as their conceptual (not metaphysical) internal reality - and in this
sense they are identical. But until the Spirit's &quot;self-realization&quot;
takes place, and Spirit steps from the position of <font color="#191970">Spirit
</font>to that of Absolute Spirit, the subject (the human mind)
mistakenly thinks that every &quot;object&quot; it perceives is
something &quot;alien&quot;, i.e. something separate or distinct from
the &quot;subject&quot;. In Hegel's words. Self-realization occurs
when Hegel (part of the non-supernatural mind of Spirit, which is the
collective mind of all men) arrives on the scene and realizes that
each &quot;object&quot; is himself, because both subject and object
are essentially Spirit. When self-actualization occurs and Spirit
becomes <font color="#8b0000">Absolute Spirit</font>, the &quot;finite&quot;
(human, human) becomes &quot;infinite&quot; (&quot;God&quot;,
divine), replacing the imaginary or &quot;imagined&quot; supernatural
God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: &quot;Hegelianism
... is a religion of <font color="#483d8b">self-worship</font>, the
fundamental theme of which is given in Hegel's image of man striving
to be God himself, claiming 'something more, namely the infinite'.&quot;
The image Hegel presents is &quot;the image of a self-glorifying
humanity that strives compulsively and ultimately successfully to
ascend to divinity.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Bradley </font>was
the obvious target of <font color="#dcdcdc">G. E. </font>Moore's
radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not
understand the <font color="#2f4f4f">claim that something is real</font>.
According to <font color="#556b2f">Moore</font>, we know for certain,
through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things
are real, whether they are objects of thought or not. His 1903
article <font color="#6b8e23">The Refutation of Idealism </font>is
one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He
examines each of the three terms in Berkeley's aphorism esse <font color="#a0522d">est
percipi</font>, 'to be is to be perceived', and concludes that it
must mean that object and subject are necessarily related such that
'to be yellow' and 'to perceive yellow' are identical - 'to be
yellow' is 'to experience yellow'. But it also seems that there is a
difference between &quot;being yellow&quot; and &quot;sensing yellow&quot;
and &quot;that the essay is considered percipi, solely because what
is experienced is considered identical with its being experienced&quot;.
While this was by no means a complete refutation, it was analytic
philosophy's first strong stand against its idealist predecessors, or
at least against the type of idealism represented by <font color="#228b22">Berkeley.
</font>This argument did not show that <font color="#191970">GEM </font>(in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Pluralistic idealism, like <font color="#a9a9a9">Gottfried
Leibniz, </font>holds that there are many individual minds that
together underlie the existence of the perceived world and make the
existence of the physical universe possible. Unlike <font color="#dcdcdc">absolute
</font>idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence
of a single ultimate mental reality or 'absolute'. Leibniz's form of
idealism, known as <font color="#2f4f4f">panpsychism</font>,
considers '<font color="#556b2f">monads' as </font>actual atoms and
entities of the universe with perceptual capacity. Monads are
'essential forms of being', elementary, individual, subject to their
own laws, non-interactive, each reflecting the universe as a whole.
Monads are centres of force that are substance, while space, matter
and motion are phenomenal, and their form and existence depend on
simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony
between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world
of objects, created by God, the central monad. Leibniz's cosmology
embraced traditional <font color="#6b8e23">Christian theism. </font>Inspired
by <font color="#191970">Leibniz, </font><font color="#a0522d">the
English </font>psychologist and philosopher <font color="#228b22">James
Ward </font>had also advocated a kind of pluralistic idealism.

with a <font color="#2f4f4f">strict ethical rigorism</font>&quot;,
which he defined as &quot;a theory of infinitely numerous gods&quot;.
The theory was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of
soul, the rational, living aspect of a living substance, which cannot
exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an
essence, and nous, <font color="#6b8e23">rational thought</font>,
reflection and understanding. Although <font color="#a0522d">Aristotle
is </font>an eternal controversialist, he probably considers the

'Czechoslovak' was designated as the official language of the
republic, both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. The
Slovak written language was partly modelled on <font color="#228b22">written
Czech</font>, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in
the Slovak half of the republic. Slovak scholars resisted the
influence of Czech on the Slovak language, and when Slovakia seceded
from Czechoslovakia in <font color="#191970">1938 </font>as the
Slovak state (which allied with Nazi Germany in World War II),
literary Slovakia deliberately distanced itself from Czech. After the
Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, the Slovak
language developed somewhat on its own (under Czech influence);
<font color="#8b0000">during the </font>Prague Spring of <font color="#8b0000">1968,

a </font>German-language Old Czech grammar book entitled
<font color="#2f4f4f">Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der böhmischen

Dobrovský had intended his book <font color="#556b2f">to be

However, Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovský's book
to argue <font color="#228b22">for the revival of the Czech language</font>.
Changes made during this period included spelling reform (notably í
replacing the former j and j with g), the use of t (rather than ti)
at the end of infinitive verbs, and the omission of capitalisation of
nouns (a late borrowing from German). These changes distinguish Czech
from Slovak. <font color="#191970">Contemporary scholars </font>disagree

word order is <font color="#dcdcdc">flexible </font>and is used <font color="#2f4f4f">for
topicalisation and focus</font>. Although Czech has a <font color="#556b2f">periphrastic
</font>passive structure (as in English), colloquial word order
changes often produce <font color="#6b8e23">a passive</font>. For
example, if you change &quot;Peter killed Paul&quot; to &quot;Peter
killed Paul&quot;, the order of subject and object <font color="#a0522d">is
reversed</font>: Petr zabil Pavla (&quot;Peter killed Paul&quot;)
becomes &quot;Paul, whom Peter killed&quot; (Pavla zabil Petr). Pavla
is in <font color="#228b22">the accusative</font>, the grammatical
object of the verb (in this case, the victim).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In Czech, nouns and adjectives are
classified into one of <font color="#a9a9a9">seven </font>grammatical
cases. Nouns <font color="#dcdcdc">are inflected </font><font color="#2f4f4f">to
indicate their use in a sentence. </font>Czech is a
nominative-accusative language, so Czech marks subject nouns <font color="#556b2f">in
the nominative </font>and object nouns in the accusative. The
genitive marks possessive nouns and some movement types. The other
cases (instrumental, <font color="#a0522d">locative, vocative and
dative</font>) express semantic relations such as secondary objects,
movement or position (dative case) and <font color="#228b22">accompaniment
</font>(instrumental case). The case of an adjective is the same as
the case of <font color="#191970">the noun it describes.</font> When

<font color="#a9a9a9">marks </font>one of two grammatical aspects of
its verbs: <font color="#dcdcdc">the perfect and the imperfect</font>.
Most verbs are part of <font color="#2f4f4f">conjugated aspectual

Although the verbs have similar <font color="#556b2f">meanings</font>,
in perfect verbs the action is <font color="#6b8e23">finished </font>and
in imperfect verbs it is in progress. This is different from the past

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the fall of Rome, the <font color="#a9a9a9">Catholic
Church became the sole maintainer of </font>literate scholarship in
Western Europe. In the early Middle Ages, the <font color="#2f4f4f">Church
established cathedral schools </font>as centres of higher education.
Some of these institutions eventually developed into <font color="#556b2f">medieval
universities</font>, the forerunners of many of Europe's modern
universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral was
home to the famous and influential <font color="#6b8e23">Chartres

Christendom were well integrated with the rest of Western Europe,
encouraging freedom of research and producing a wide range of great
scholars and natural philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas of the
University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of Oxford University, an
early exponent of the systematic method of scientific
experimentation, and St Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological
field research. Founded in 1088, the <font color="#a0522d">University

education </font>(or initial education) consists of the <font color="#2f4f4f">first
five to seven years of formal, structured education</font>. In
general, primary education consists of six to eight years of
schooling, starting at the age of five or six, but this varies
between and sometimes within countries. Globally, around 89% of
children aged 6-12 years are enrolled in primary education, and this
proportion is increasing. <font color="#6b8e23">Most countries have

between primary and secondary education </font>is somewhat arbitrary,
but usually occurs around the age of 11 or 12. Some education systems
have separate upper secondary schools, and the transition to the
final stage of secondary education takes place at around fourteen
years of age. Primary schools are most often referred to as
elementary or comprehensive schools. Primary schools are often
divided into infant schools and primary schools.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In most of the world's current
education systems, secondary education comprises <font color="#a9a9a9">formal
education during adolescence</font>. It is characterised by the
transition from compulsory, comprehensive basic education, typical of
minors, to optional, selective tertiary education for adults,
'post-secondary' or 'higher' education (e.g. <font color="#dcdcdc">university,
vocational school).</font> Depending on the system, some or all of
the schools in this period may be called secondary schools, upper
secondary schools, upper secondary schools, upper secondary schools,
upper secondary schools, higher education institutions or vocational
schools. The precise meaning of these terms varies from one system to
another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education
also varies from country to country and even within countries, but
generally it runs from around the seventh to the tenth year of
schooling. Secondary education mainly takes place <font color="#2f4f4f">in
the teenage years. In the </font>United States, Canada and Australia,
primary and secondary education is sometimes referred to as K-12
education, and in New Zealand as grades 1-13. Secondary education can
be aimed at providing general education, <font color="#556b2f">preparation
for higher education or direct vocational training.</font></p>

hardly knows which is which. He only pursues his vision of excellence
through the work he does and leaves it to others to decide whether he
is at work or at play. For himself, he always seems to be doing both.
It is enough for him to do it well.&quot; Education through leisure

in <font color="#a9a9a9">the Watauga Association</font>, a 1772
boundary treaty that is widely regarded as the first constitutional
government west of the Appalachians. Present-day Tennessee was
initially part of <font color="#dcdcdc">North Carolina </font>and
later part of the Southwest Territory. Tennessee was admitted to the
Union as the 16th state on <font color="#2f4f4f">June 1, 1796</font>.
<font color="#556b2f">Tennessee </font>was the last state to leave
the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the American

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Tennessee supplied more soldiers to
the Confederate army than any other state and more soldiers to the
Union army than any other Southern state. From the beginning of the
Reconstruction era, the state had competitive party politics, but a<font color="#a9a9a9">

disenfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor
whites from voting. This sharply reduced competition in state
politics until <font color="#dcdcdc">civil rights legislation </font>was
passed in the mid-1900s. Tennessee moved from an
agricultural-dominated economy to a more diversified economy in the

Tanasi (or &quot;Tanase&quot;) in what is now Monroe County,
Tennessee. The town was located on the river of the same name (now
known as the Little Tennessee River) and appears on maps as early as
<font color="#556b2f">1725</font>. It is not known whether this was
the same town as the one Juan Pardo encountered, although recent

from the coast that it is not directly affected by hurricanes, the
state's location means that it can still be affected by the remnants
of tropical cyclones that weaken over land and can cause significant
rainfall, such as Tropical Storm Chris in 1982 and <font color="#a9a9a9">Hurricane
Opal </font>in 1995. On average, the state experiences thunderstorms
on about <font color="#dcdcdc">50 </font>days each year, some of
which can be intense and include large hail and damaging winds.

strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating tornadoes
of April 2011 that killed 20 people in North Georgia and Southeast

Reconstruction, the power struggle in southern society continued.
Through violence and intimidation of freedmen and their allies, white
Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other southern
states in the late 1870s and 1880s. Over the next decade, state
legislatures passed increasingly restrictive laws to control <font color="#a9a9a9">African
Americans</font>. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1889, </font>the General
Assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform, the
cumulative effect of which was to effectively disenfranchise most
rural and small-town African Americans and many <font color="#2f4f4f">poor
whites</font>. The legislation included the introduction of a poll
tax, the timing of registration, and registration requirements. Tens
of thousands of taxpayers were without representation for decades
into the 20th century. The disenfranchisement legislation was linked
to the <font color="#556b2f">Jim Crow laws of the </font>late 19th
century<font color="#556b2f">, which </font>regulated racial
segregation in the state. In 1900, African Americans made up nearly

former free coloured people were given the right to vote; most joined
the <font color="#a9a9a9">Republican </font>Party. Numerous African
Americans were elected to local office and some to state office.
After Reconstruction, party politics in Tennessee remained
competitive. However, the white-dominated state government passed
four laws <font color="#dcdcdc">in the 1880s</font>, the last of
which established a poll tax for voter registration. These laws
disenfranchised most African-Americans, and their power in the

cities where they had a significant population was greatly reduced.
In 1900, African Americans made up <font color="#556b2f">23.8 percent
of the </font>state's <font color="#556b2f">population</font>, and
were concentrated in Middle Tennessee and West Tennessee. In the
early 1900s, the state legislature adopted a form of commission
governance for cities based on voting for a few <font color="#6b8e23">Board
of Commission </font>seats in a wide area; several cities adopted
this as another means of limiting African American political
participation. In 1913, the state legislature passed a bill allowing

<font color="#2f4f4f">as </font><font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;</font><font color="#2f4f4f">a
fusion of art and music</font><font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;</font><font color="#556b2f">.
The </font>era saw a strong assimilation of ideas <font color="#6b8e23">from
literature, art, film, philosophy, politics and critical theory </font><font color="#a0522d">into
musical and pop-cultural contexts. </font>Artists sought to reject
the general distinction between <font color="#228b22">high culture
and low culture </font>and returned to the art-school tradition as
seen in the work of artists such as <font color="#8b0000">Captain
Beefheart and David Bowie</font>. Post-punk artists were influenced
by writers such as <font color="#483d8b">William S. Burroughs and
J.G. Ballard</font>, avant-garde political scenes such as
Situationism and Dada, and intellectual movements such as
<font color="#3cb371">Postmodernism</font>. Many artists saw their
work in explicitly political terms. Moreover, in some places, the
creation of post-punk music was closely linked to the development of
powerful subcultures that played an important role in the production
of music-related art, multimedia performances, fanzines and
independent record labels. Many post-punk artists retained <font color="#663399">an
anti-corporatist </font>approach to recording and instead embraced
alternative means of producing and releasing music. <font color="#008080">Journalists
</font>also became an important part of the culture, and popular
music magazines and critics immersed themselves in the movement.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The term &quot;post-punk&quot; has
been <font color="#a9a9a9">controversial</font>. Some critics, such
as <font color="#2f4f4f">AllMusic's </font><font color="#6b8e23">Stephen

mean &quot;a more adventurous and artistic form of punk&quot;, while
others have suggested that it refers to a range of artistic
sensibilities and approaches rather than any <font color="#a0522d">unifying
style</font>. Music journalist and post-punk scholar <font color="#191970">Simon
Reynolds </font>has advocated <font color="#191970">post-punk</font>
as &quot;less a musical genre than a <font color="#8b0000">space of

the 2000s, a </font>post-punk revival developed in British and
American alternative and indie rock, which soon spread to other
countries. The earliest sign of a revival was <font color="#2f4f4f">the
emergence of various underground bands in </font><font color="#556b2f">the
mid-1990s. </font>However, the first commercially successful bands -
<font color="#6b8e23">The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, Neils

bands such as <font color="#228b22">Rapture, Radio 4 and LCD
Soundsystem. The </font><font color="#191970">2010s </font>also saw
the emergence of some darker post-punk bands on the indie scene, such
as <font color="#8b0000">Cold Cave, She Wants Revenge, Eagulls, The
Soft Moon, She Past Away and Light Asylum, who </font>also joined the
darkwave fervour, and A Place to Bury Strangers, which combined early
post-punk with shoegaze. These bands tend to attract a fan base that
is a mix of <font color="#483d8b">indie music </font>subculture,
older post-punk fans and the current gothic subculture. In the 2010s,
<font color="#bc8f8f">Savages </font>played music reminiscent of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Introduced by the ORFU in <font color="#dcdcdc">1903,
</font>the Burnside rules, similar to American football, were
designed to <font color="#2f4f4f">distinguish it from the more
rugby-oriented game</font>. Burnside's rules reduced teams <font color="#556b2f">to
12 men per side</font>, introduced the snap-back system, required the
attacking team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the
sideline throw-in, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all
kicking goals were worth two points and that the opponent had to get
within 10 yards of the defenders during all kicks. The rules were
intended to standardise the rules throughout the country. The <font color="#6b8e23">CIRFU,
QRFU and CRU </font>initially refused to accept the new rules. No
forward passes were allowed in the Canadian game until <font color="#a0522d">1929,
</font>and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to
six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans
had adopted the same changes. The main differences between the
Canadian and <font color="#228b22">American </font>games stem from
<font color="#191970">rule changes </font>that were adopted on the
American side of the border but not on the Canadian side (originally
both sides had three downs, goalposts at the goal line and unlimited
passing, but on the American side these rules were changed but not on
the Canadian side). The width of the Canadian field was one rule that
was not based on the American rules, as the Canadians played on wider
fields and in stadiums that were not as narrow as the American
stadiums.</p>

</font>football field is 150 yards (137 m) long and <font color="#dcdcdc">65
</font>yards (59 m) wide, the ends are 20 yards (18 m) deep and the
goal lines are 110 yards (101 m) apart. On each goal line are 40-foot
(12 m) high goal posts consisting of two vertical poles connected by
an 18 1⁄2-foot (<font color="#2f4f4f">5.6 </font>m) long crossbar 3
feet (10 m) above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both
poles anchored to the ground), although in higher caliber
competitions <font color="#556b2f">a tuning fork is </font>preferred
(supported by a single curved pole behind the finish line, with each
pole starting 3 m (10 ft) above the ground). The <font color="#6b8e23">sides
of the field </font>are marked with white side lines, the finish line
is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the
field at 5-yard (4.6 m) intervals from the finish line. These lateral
lines are called <font color="#a0522d">yard lines and are </font>often
marked with a distance in yards and an arrow pointing towards the
nearest goal line. In earlier decades, arrows were not used, and each
yard line was usually marked with the distance to the goal line,
including the goal line itself, which was marked with the number '0';
nowadays, in most stadiums, the <font color="#228b22">10-, 20-, 30-,
40- and 50-yard lines are marked with numbers</font>, and the <font color="#191970">goal

</font><font color="#2f4f4f">downs </font>or lose the ball to his
opponent. Once the ten yards are gained, the offense gets another
three downs (instead of the four downs used in American football).
Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team gains 10 yards on its
first play, it loses two more downs and gains <font color="#6b8e23">three
more downs</font>. If a team fails to gain 10 yards on two downs, it
will usually <font color="#a0522d">punt </font><font color="#228b22">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In this type of football, there are
many rules that need to be followed. Firstly, the only player on the
pitch who can be legally tackled is the player in possession of the
football (<font color="#dcdcdc">the ball carrier)</font>. Secondly,
the receiver, i.e. <font color="#2f4f4f">the attacking player </font>sent
onto the field to receive the pass, may not be tackled (his movement
may not be impeded, he may not be blocked, etc.) unless he is within
<font color="#556b2f">one yard of </font>the line of scrimmage
(instead of the 5 yards (4.6 m) used in American football). Any
player may block another player's pass as long as he does not <font color="#6b8e23">hold
on to or trip over </font>the player he intends to block. The kicker
may not be contacted <font color="#a0522d">after the kick </font>but
before the kicking foot returns to the ground (this rule does not
apply to the player who has blocked the kick), nor may the
<font color="#228b22">quarterback, who has </font>already thrown the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Violations of the rules are punished
by penalties, usually resulting in <font color="#a9a9a9">a loss of </font>5,
10 or 15 yards against the penalised team. Minor infractions, such as
offside (a player on either side entering the scrimmage area before
the play starts) are penalized <font color="#dcdcdc">five </font><font color="#2f4f4f">yards</font>,
more serious infractions (such as possession) are penalized <font color="#556b2f">10
yards, </font>and serious infractions (such as covering the face) are
usually penalized <font color="#6b8e23">15 </font><font color="#a0522d">yards</font>.
Depending on the penalty, penalty yards can be assessed from the
original starting point, from where the infraction occurred (for
example, pass interference), or from where the ball ended up after
the play. Penalties on offense may or may not result in a loss of a
down; penalties on defense may result in the offense automatically
gaining a <font color="#228b22">first down.</font> For particularly
serious behaviour, the match official(s) may eject players from the
game (ejected players may be substituted) or, in exceptional cases,
declare the game over and award a win to either side. Penalties do
not affect the yardage line that the offense must gain to gain <font color="#191970">first
down </font>(unless the penalty results in a first down); if the
penalty on the defense results in a first down yardage, the offense
gains first down.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By 1763, the war in central Europe
was effectively at a stalemate. Frederick had recaptured most of
Silesia and Saxony, but not the latter's capital Dresden. His
economic situation was not bad, but <font color="#a9a9a9">his kingdom
was destroyed and his army severely weakened</font>. His troops had
been dramatically reduced, and he had lost so many effective officers
and generals that a new invasion might be impossible. The <font color="#dcdcdc">new
Prime Minister, Lord Bute, had cut off British aid, and </font>the
Russian Emperor had been superseded by his wife <font color="#2f4f4f">Catherine,
who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war</font>.
However, Austria, like most of the participants, was in <font color="#556b2f">serious
financial crisis and had to reduce the size of its army, which had a
</font>major impact on its offensive power. Having effectively
endured a long war, its administration was indeed in disarray. At
that time it still held Dresden, south-eastern Saxony, the county of
Glatz and southern Silesia, but the prospects of victory were dim
without Russian support. <font color="#6b8e23">The Treaty of

more say over the path its army should take, and managed to slip out
of the war of its own volition. Most importantly, now that a somewhat

united under <font color="#2f4f4f">George III of Great Britain</font>,
it could amass considerable power, even bring Britain into the fold,
in future conflicts. This power dynamic is important for future and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Richard Phillips Feynman
(/ˈfaɪnmən/; 11 May 1918 - 15 February 1988) was an American
theoretical physicist known for his work on the path integral form of
quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics
of superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, and particle physics,
for which he proposed <font color="#a9a9a9">the razor model</font>.
For his contribution to the development of quantum electrodynamics,
Feynman, together <font color="#dcdcdc">with Julian Schwinger and
Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, </font>was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in
<font color="#2f4f4f">1965. </font>He developed a widely used
pictorial representation of the mathematical expressions governing
the behaviour of subatomic particles, later known <font color="#556b2f">as
Feynman diagrams</font>. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of
the world's most famous scientists. In a 1999 survey of 130 leading
physicists by the British magazine Physics World, he was <font color="#6b8e23">ranked
as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time</font>.</p>

Poland; both his parents were Ashkenazi Jews. They were not
religious, and in his youth Feynman described himself as a &quot;confirmed
<font color="#556b2f">atheist</font>&quot;. He also stated, &quot;To
select for acceptance peculiar elements derived from some supposed
Jewish inheritance opens the door to all sorts of nonsense about race
theory&quot;, and added &quot;... at the age of thirteen I not only
converted to other religious views, but also ceased to believe that
Jews were in any way a 'chosen people'.&quot; Later in life, while
attending a Jewish theological seminary, he encountered the <font color="#6b8e23">Talmud

Feynman's first seminar was attended by Albert Einstein, Wolfgang
Pauli and John von Neumann, among others. He received <font color="#6b8e23">his</font>
doctorate from Princeton in 1942; his supervisor was John Archibald
Wheeler. Feynman's thesis applied the principle of stationary action
to problems in quantum mechanics, inspired by the desire to quantify
the Wheeler-Feynman absorption theory of electrodynamics, and laid
the foundations for the 'path integral approach' and Feynman
diagrams, and was entitled '<font color="#a0522d">The Principle of
Least Action in Quantum Mechanics</font>'.</p>

his curiosity by learning to break into the combination locks on

his colleagues. In one case, he found the combination of a locked
filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use
(it turned out to be 27-18-28 after the natural logarithm base e =
2.71828...), and he discovered that the three filing cabinets where a

been called &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">the great explainer</font>&quot;.
He gained a reputation for being very careful in his explanations to
his students and for his moral duty to make the subject accessible.
His guiding principle was that if a subject could not be explained in
a first-year lecture, it was not yet <font color="#2f4f4f">fully
understood</font>. Feynman took great pleasure in coming up with such
a 'freshman-level' explanation of the connection between spin and
statistics, for example. He said that <font color="#556b2f">groups of
particles with a </font>spin of ½ &quot;repel&quot;, while groups
with an integer spin &quot;cluster&quot;. This was a brilliantly
simplified way of showing how Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein
statistics evolved as a result of studying how fermions and bosons
behave in a 360° rotational motion. He also considered this question
in his more advanced lectures, and he demonstrated the solution in
his Dirac Memorial Lecture in 1986. In the same lecture, he also
explained that <font color="#6b8e23">antiparticles </font>must exist,
because if particles had only positive energies, they would not be
confined to the so-called '<font color="#a0522d">light cone'.</font></p>

Feynman's idea of these diagrams started from the approximation of a
hard sphere, and interactions could initially be thought of as
collisions. It was only decades later that physicists thought to
analyse the knots in Feynman's diagrams in more detail. Feynman

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Feynman was then able to model the
whole of physics in terms of the spin and fundamental force coupling
fields of these particles, using diagrams of a small number of
particles interacting in space-time. Feynman tried to explain the
strong interactions that drive nucleon scattering with a parton
model. The <font color="#a9a9a9">parton model </font>was developed to
complement the <font color="#dcdcdc">quark model </font>developed by
his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the
two models was obscure; Gell-Mann derisively called Feynman's partons
&quot;put-ons&quot;. In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that
quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, <font color="#2f4f4f">not
real particles, because </font>the statistics of the omega-minus
particle, if interpreted as three identical strangely bound-together
quarks, seemed impossible if quarks were real. Experiments in deep
inelastic scattering on the Stanford linear accelerator in the late
1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point
particles that scattered electrons, similar to <font color="#556b2f">Ernest
</font>Rutherford's 1911 experiment in which alpha particles
scattered into gold nuclei. It was natural to identify these as
quarks, but Feynman's razor model sought to interpret experimental
data in a way that did not introduce new hypotheses. For example, the
data showed that about 45% of the energy momentum was carried by
electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically
neutral particles are now thought to be gluons, which carry the
forces between quarks and also carry the trivalent colour quantum
number that solves the Omega minus problem. Feynman did not dispute
the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in
1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the
discovery implied the existence of <font color="#6b8e23">a sixth
quark</font>, which was discovered in the decade following his death.</p>

By this time in the early 1960s, Feynman was exhausting himself
working on several major projects simultaneously, including a request
while at Caltech to &quot;clean up&quot; undergraduate teaching.
After three years of dedication, he produced a series of lectures
that eventually became <font color="#dcdcdc">The Feynman Lectures on
Physics</font>. He wanted a picture of a drum head sprinkled with
powder at the beginning of the book to show the modes of vibration.
The publishers, concerned that the picture might suggest <font color="#2f4f4f">links
with drugs and rock'n'roll</font>, changed the cover to red, but
added a picture of him playing <font color="#556b2f">drums in </font>the

Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time authors for
several years. Although most universities did not adopt the books as
textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide an
in-depth understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and
miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including <font color="#6b8e23">The

teaching Carl, using discussions about <font color="#a9a9a9">ants and
Martians, </font>for example, as a tool to put problems and questions
into perspective. He was surprised to learn that the same teaching
tools were not useful with Michelle. <font color="#dcdcdc">Mathematics
</font>was a shared interest between father and son; both entered the
computer industry as consultants and were involved in developing a
new method of using multiple computers to solve complex problems - a
method later known <font color="#2f4f4f">as parallel computing</font>.
The <font color="#556b2f">Jet Propulsion Laboratory </font>used
Feynman as a computing consultant for critical tasks. A colleague

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Feynman travelled to Brazil, where
he held courses at the BCPF (<font color="#a9a9a9">Brazilian </font>Centre
for <font color="#a9a9a9">Physics Research), </font>and near the end
of his life he planned to visit the Russian <font color="#dcdcdc">city
of Tuva, a </font>dream that never came true due to the bureaucratic
problems of the Cold War. The <font color="#2f4f4f">day after his
death, </font>he received a letter from the Soviet government giving
him permission to travel to Tuva. Later, <font color="#556b2f">Feynman's
daughter Michelle </font>would make the trip. His eagerness to get to
Tuva gave rise to the phrase 'Tuva or Bust' (also the title of a book
about his efforts there), which was often thrown around among his
circle of friends in the hope that they might one day see it first
hand. The documentary <font color="#6b8e23">Genghis Blues </font>mentions
some of his attempts to communicate with Tuva and recounts his
friends' successful journey there. Responding to Hubert Humphrey's
congratulations on the Nobel Prize, Feynman admitted that he had long

Tripoli and Benghazi, which were attacked by police and Gaddafi
students. The RCC responded with mass arrests and the introduction of
compulsory military service for young people. Conservative clerics
and the Muslim Brotherhood, who were persecuted as
anti-revolutionaries, also dissented. In January 1977, <font color="#556b2f">two

retaliation he planned to destroy the RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, a
British ship chartered by American Jews to sail <font color="#6b8e23">to

Egypt and <font color="#a9a9a9">Syria </font>planned the Yom Kippur

Egypt agreed to peace talks instead of continuing the war. Gaddafi
became openly hostile to the Egyptian leader and called for Sadat to
be deposed, and when Sudanese President <font color="#dcdcdc">Gaafar
Nimeiry </font>sided with Sadat, by 1975 Gaddafi supported <font color="#2f4f4f">the

African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973.
Gaddafi was intent on spreading Islam and in 1973 founded the Islamic
Call Society, which opened 132 centres across Africa in a decade. In

</font>Libya signed the Hassi Messaoud Defence Pact, ostensibly to

and introduce Sharia law; he declared &quot;man-made&quot; laws to be
unnatural and dictatorial, allowing only Allah's law. Within a year,
he backtracked and declared that Sharia was not suitable for
Jamahiriya because it guaranteed <font color="#dcdcdc">protection of

Green Book. His insistence on putting his own work on a par with the
Koran led conservative clerics to accuse him <font color="#2f4f4f">of

a border war with <font color="#556b2f">Egypt </font>broke out, in

Magariaf </font>in 1981, which organised military strikes against the

orders to kill these 'stray dogs', under the leadership of Colonel
Younis Bilgasim, the revolutionary committees set up foreign branches
to suppress counter-revolutionary activity and assassinate various
dissidents. Although nearby states, such as Syria, also used
mercenary groups, Gaddafi was unusual in publicly boasting about his

relations with Lebanon and Shia communities around the world also
deteriorated following the disappearance of Imam Musa al-Sadr, who
had visited Libya in August 1978; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of
killing or imprisoning him, which Gaddafi denied. Relations with
Syria improved as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad became
hostile to Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980 they proposed a
political union in which Libya would pay Syria's <font color="#556b2f">£1
billion </font>debt to the Soviet Union; although Assad withdrew
under pressure, they remained allies. Another important ally was
Uganda, and in 1979 Gaddafi sent 2 500 troops to Uganda to defend

which took place in November <font color="#556b2f">1981.</font> The
civil war resumed, and Libya sent troops back into the country and
clashed with French forces supporting those in southern Chad. Many
African states were fed up with Libya's policy of interference in
foreign policy; by 1980, nine African states had severed diplomatic
relations with Libya, and in 1982 the OAU cancelled its planned
conference in Tripoli to prevent Gaddafi becoming president. Gaddafi
proposed political unity with Morocco, and in August 1984 Gaddafi and
Moroccan monarch <font color="#6b8e23">Hassan II </font>signed the
Oujda Pact to form the Arab-African Union, a union that was
considered surprising given the major political differences and
long-standing animosity between the two governments. Relations
remained strained, particularly because of Morocco's friendly
relations with the United States and Israel; in August 1986 Hassan
dissolved the alliance. Internal political threats continued to
plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, a joint NFSL-Muslim Brotherhood militia
unsuccessfully raided his Bab al-Azizia home, followed by the arrest
of 5,000 dissidents.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1981, the new US President Ronald
Reagan took a hard-line approach to Libya, mistaking it for <font color="#a9a9a9">a
Soviet puppet regime</font>. Gaddafi, for his part, emphasised his
commercial relations with the Soviet Union, visited Moscow again in
April <font color="#dcdcdc">1981 and 1985 </font>and threatened to
join <font color="#2f4f4f">the Warsaw Pact.</font> The Soviet Union,
however, was wary of Gaddafi because it regarded him as an
unpredictable extremist. In August 1981, when the United States began
military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte - a sea area that Libya
claimed as part of its territorial waters - it shot down two Libyan
Su-22 aircraft that were monitoring them. Reagan closed the Libyan
embassy in Washington and urged US companies operating in the country
to reduce the number of American personnel stationed there. In March
1982, the United States imposed an oil embargo on Libya, and in
January 1986 it ordered all US companies to cease operations in the
country, although several hundred workers remained. Diplomatic
relations were also severed with the United Kingdom after Libyan
diplomats were accused of shooting Yvonne Fletcher, a British <font color="#6b8e23">police
officer </font>who was standing outside the London embassy, in April
1984. In the spring of 1986, the US Navy resumed exercises in the
Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan army retaliated but failed when the US sank
several Libyan ships.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When the United States blamed Libya
for the <font color="#a9a9a9">1986 Berlin disco bomb attack </font>that
killed <font color="#dcdcdc">two </font>American soldiers, Reagan
decided to take military action. The Central Intelligence Agency was
critical, believing that <font color="#2f4f4f">Syria </font>posed a
greater threat and that an attack would strengthen Gaddafi's
reputation; Libya was, however, considered a 'soft target'. The UK
supported Reagan, but other European allies opposed it as they
considered it contrary to international law. In Operation El Dorado
Canyon, which took place on 15 April 1986, US warplanes carried out
several air strikes in Libya, bombing military installations across
the country and killing around <font color="#556b2f">100 </font>Libyans,
including several civilians. One of the targets had been Gaddafi's
home. Gaddafi himself was unharmed, but two of his sons were injured,
and he claimed that his four-year-old adopted daughter <font color="#6b8e23">Hanna
</font>was killed, although her existence has since been questioned. 
Immediately after the attack, Gaddafi retreated to the desert to
meditate, and there were occasional clashes between Gaddafi and army
officers seeking to overthrow the government. Despite international
condemnation of the United States, Reagan was applauded at home. When
Gaddafi publicly denounced US imperialism, his reputation as an
anti-imperialist was reinforced both at home and throughout the Arab
world, and in June 1986 he ordered a change of name of the month in
Libya.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 1980s, Libya implemented
a series of liberalising economic reforms to cope with declining oil
revenues. In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the launch of a 'revolution
within a revolution', starting with industrial and agricultural
reforms and the reopening of small businesses. The Revolutionary
Committees were restricted; in March 1988 the newly created Ministry
of Mass Mobilisation and Revolutionary Leadership curtailed their
role by limiting their violent and judicial role, and in August 1988
Gaddafi publicly criticised them, claiming that &quot;they deviate,
harm and torture&quot; and that &quot;a true revolutionary does not
engage in repression&quot;. In March, hundreds of political prisoners
were released and Gaddafi falsely claimed that there were no more
political prisoners in Libya. In June, the Libyan Government
published a major Green Charter for Human Rights in the Age of the
Masses, which in its <font color="#2f4f4f">27 articles set out
</font>objectives, rights and guarantees to improve the human rights
situation in Libya, limiting the use of the death penalty and calling
for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures proposed in the
Charter would be implemented the following year, but others were not.
In 1989, the government also established the Al-Gaddafi International
Human Rights Prize, awarded to individuals from the Third World who
fought against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's prize
went to <font color="#556b2f">South African </font>anti-apartheid
activist <font color="#6b8e23">Nelson Mandela.</font> From 1994 to
1997, the government set up purge committees to root out corruption,

was purged of elements deemed disloyal, and in 1988 Gaddafi announced
the creation of a popular militia to replace the <font color="#a9a9a9">army
and police</font>. In 1987, Libya began producing <font color="#dcdcdc">mustard
gas at a </font>facility <font color="#2f4f4f">in Rabba, </font>despite
publicly denying that it was stockpiling chemical weapons and
unsuccessfully trying to develop nuclear weapons. This period also
saw the rise of an internal Islamist opposition, which formed groups
such as the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.
Several assassination attempts against Gaddafi failed, and in 1989
security forces raided mosques believed to be centres of
counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, increasingly
marginalised members of the army launched a failed coup in <font color="#556b2f">Misrata,
in </font>September 1995 Islamists launched an uprising in <font color="#6b8e23">Benghazi,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1989, Gaddafi hailed the creation
of the Maghreb Arab League, which brought Libya into an economic pact
with <font color="#a9a9a9">Mauritania</font>, Morocco, Tunisia and
Algeria, as the beginning of a new pan-Arab alliance. At the same
time, Libya increased its support for anti-Western militants such as
the Provisional IRA, and in 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over
Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew and <font color="#dcdcdc">11
</font>people on the ground. A British police investigation
identified two Libyans - <font color="#2f4f4f">Abdelbaset al-Megrahi
</font>and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah - as the prime suspects and a
statement was issued in November 1991 calling for their extradition.
When Gaddafi refused, invoking the Montreal Convention, the United
Nations (UN) adopted Resolution <font color="#556b2f">748 in </font>March
1992, which launched economic sanctions against Libya, with serious
repercussions on the country's economy. As a result, the country
suffered economic losses estimated at <font color="#6b8e23">$900
million.</font> Further problems with the West arose when the United
States shot down two Libyan military aircraft off the Libyan coast in
January 1989. Many African countries opposed the UN sanctions, and
Mandela criticised them during a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997,
when he praised Libya for its work to combat apartheid and awarded
Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. The sanctions were only lifted in
1998 when Libya agreed, in a process overseen by Mandela, to allow
the extradition of suspects to a Scottish court in the Netherlands.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As the 20th century drew to a close,
Gaddafi increasingly rejected Arab nationalism because his pan-Arab
ideals had failed; instead, he turned to pan-Africanism and
emphasised Libya's African identity. Between 1997 and 2000, Libya
entered into cooperation agreements or bilateral assistance
arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 Libya joined the
<font color="#a9a9a9">Community of Sahel and Saharan States</font>.
In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the
following month he attended the OAU summit <font color="#dcdcdc">in
Algiers</font>, where he called for greater political and economic
integration of the continent and advocated the creation of a United
States of Africa. He became one of the founders of the <font color="#2f4f4f">African
</font>Union (AU), which replaced the OAU in July 2002; at the
opening ceremony he declared that African states should reject
conditional aid from developed countries, in direct contradiction to
the message of South African President <font color="#556b2f">Thabo
Mbeki.</font> At the third AU summit, held in Libya in July 2005, he
called for greater integration and advocated a common AU passport, a
common defence system and a common currency, using the slogan 'The
United States of Africa is hope'. In June 2005, Libya joined the
Common Market for <font color="#6b8e23">Eastern and Southern Africa
</font>(COMESA) and in August 2008, a committee of traditional
African leaders declared Gaddafi 'King of Kings'. On 1 February 2009,
his 'coronation ceremony' was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
coinciding with Gaddafi's election as AU chairman for one year.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At that time, Libya returned to the
international arena. In 1999, Libya began secret negotiations with
the British government to normalise relations. In 2001, Gaddafi
condemned the September 11 attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda,
expressed his sympathy for the victims and called on Libya to join
the war on terrorism against militant Islamism. His government
continued its crackdown on domestic Islamism at a time when Gaddafi
was calling for wider application of Sharia law. Libya also
strengthened ties with China and North Korea, and was visited by
Chinese President <font color="#a9a9a9">Jiang Zemin in </font>April
2002. As a result of the events of <font color="#dcdcdc">the Iraq
war, </font>Libya gave up its possession of weapons of mass
destruction in December 2003 and dismantled its chemical and nuclear
weapons programmes. Relations with the United States improved as a
result, and British Prime Minister <font color="#2f4f4f">Tony Blair
</font>met Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. The following
month, Gaddafi travelled to the European Union (EU) headquarters <font color="#556b2f">in
Brussels</font>, marking an improvement in relations between Libya
and the EU, and the EU lifted the remaining sanctions in October. In
October 2010, the EU paid Libya <font color="#6b8e23">€50 million
to </font>prevent African migrants from entering Europe. Gaddafi
encouraged this move, saying it was necessary to avoid European
cultural identity being lost in the way of a new 'black Europe'.
Gaddafi was removed from the US list of states sponsoring terrorism
in 2006, but he nevertheless continued his anti-Western rhetoric, and
at the Second Africa-South America Summit in Venezuela in September
2009 he joined Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in calling for an
'anti-imperialist' front in Africa and Latin America. Gaddafi
proposed the creation of a South Atlantic Alliance to rival NATO. In
the same month, he also addressed the United Nations General Assembly
in New York for the first time, where he condemned 'Western
aggression'. In spring 2010, Gaddafi declared jihad against
Switzerland after Swiss police accused two members of his family of
criminal activities in the country, leading to a breakdown in
bilateral relations.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Libyan economy was increasingly
privatised, and although the rulers rejected the socialist policy of
nationalised industry set out in the Green Paper, they asserted that
they were creating &quot;people's socialism&quot; instead of
capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms and called for large-scale
privatisation in a speech in <font color="#a9a9a9">March 2003. In
</font>2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private companies
and by 2004, Libya had attracted <font color="#dcdcdc">$40 billion in
</font>foreign direct investment, <font color="#2f4f4f">six times
more than </font>in 2003. The Libyan population reacted against the
reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006 revolutionary
hardliners took over the GPC cabinet; although they slowed the pace
of change, they did not stop it. In 2010, plans were announced to
privatise <font color="#556b2f">half of </font>Libya's economy over
the next decade. No political liberalisation took place and Gaddafi
maintained his dominant position. In March 2010, however, the
government transferred more power to local councils. A growing number
of reformist technocrats entered the government, most famously
Gaddafi's son and heir, <font color="#6b8e23">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi,
who was </font>openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led
a group that proposed a new constitution, although it was never
adopted, and was appointed head of the PSLC in October 2009. Saif was
involved in promoting tourism and set up several private media
channels in 2008, but they were nationalised in 2009 following
government criticism. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologised on behalf
of Arab countries to African leaders for their involvement in the
African slave trade.</p>

Gaddafi withdrew to <font color="#dcdcdc">Sirte </font>after the fall
of Tripoli and announced his willingness to negotiate a handover to
the transitional government, but this proposal was rejected by the
NTC. Gaddafi surrounded himself with bodyguards, constantly changed
his residence to avoid NTC bombings and devoted his days to prayer
and reading the Koran. On 20 October, Gaddafi fled District 2 in
Sirte in a civilian and military convoy, hoping to take refuge in the
Jarref Valley. At around 8.30am, NATO bombers attacked, destroying at
least 14 vehicles and killing at least <font color="#556b2f">53
people</font>. The convoy dispersed and Gaddafi and his family fled
to a nearby villa, which was bombed by rebel forces from Misrata.

Gaddafi and assaulted him, causing serious injuries; the events were
filmed on a mobile phone. The video shows Gaddafi being poked or
stabbed in the buttocks with 'some kind of stick or knife' or
possibly a bayonet. He was pulled into the front of a pick-up truck,
from which he fell off as the truck drove away. His semi-naked,
lifeless body was put into an ambulance and taken to <font color="#a9a9a9">Misrata</font>;
there he was pronounced dead. According to official NTC reports, Mr
Gaddafi had been caught in the crossfire and died of his bullet
wounds. According to other witnesses, Gaddafi was fatally shot in the
stomach by the rebels; the rebel, who identified himself as <font color="#dcdcdc">Senad

presumably as a result of an extrajudicial execution. Some 140

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As a schoolboy, Gaddafi adopted the
ideologies of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, influenced in
particular by <font color="#a9a9a9">Nasserism</font>, the ideas of
Egyptian revolutionary and President Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom Gaddafi
accepted as his hero. In the early 1970s, Gaddafi formulated his own
approach to Arab nationalism and socialism, known as the <font color="#dcdcdc">Third
International theory, which </font>has been described as a
combination of 'utopian socialism, Arab nationalism and the <font color="#2f4f4f">Third
World revolutionary theory </font>then in vogue'. He set out the
principles of this theory in <font color="#556b2f">the three </font>volumes
of the Green Book, in which he sought to 'explain the structure of an
ideal society'. His Arab nationalist views led him to believe that
the entire Arab world had to be united and that the Arab peoples had
to be united under a single nation state. He described his economic
approach as &quot;Islamic socialism&quot;, although biographers
Blundy and Lycett noted that Gaddafi's socialism had a &quot;peculiarly
Marxist undertone&quot;, and <font color="#6b8e23">political
scientist </font>Sami Hajjar argued that Gaddafi's model of socialism
was a simplified version of the theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels. Gaddafi saw his socialist Jamahiriyah as a model to be
followed by Arab, Islamic and non-aligned countries.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Gaddafi's ideological worldview was
shaped by his environment, namely his Islamic faith, his Bedouin
upbringing and his disgust at the actions of European colonialists in
Libya. He was driven by a 'divine mission', believing himself to be
an agent of Allah's will and thinking that he had to achieve his
goals 'at any cost'. Gaddafi, who was brought up in <font color="#dcdcdc">Sunni
</font>Islam<font color="#dcdcdc">, called for </font>the
introduction of Sharia in Libya. He wanted unity throughout the
Islamic world and encouraged the spread of the faith elsewhere. In
<font color="#2f4f4f">2010, </font>during a visit to Italy, he paid a
modelling agency to find 200 young Italian women for a lecture urging
them to convert. He also funded the construction and renovation of
two mosques in Africa, including the Kampala mosque in Uganda.
However, he clashed with conservative Libyan clerics over his
interpretation of Islam. Many criticised his efforts to encourage
women to enter traditionally male-only sectors of society, such as
the armed forces. Gaddafi wanted to improve the status of women, but
considered the sexes &quot;separate but equal&quot; and therefore
believed that women should generally remain in their traditional
roles.</p>

Gaddafi's ideology. He believed that the state of Israel should not
exist and that any Arab compromise with the Israeli government was a
betrayal of the Arab people. Largely <font color="#a9a9a9">because of
his support for Israel</font>,<font color="#a9a9a9"> </font>Gaddafi
despised <font color="#dcdcdc">the United States</font>, considered
the country imperialist and called it 'the embodiment of evil'. In
many of their speeches, <font color="#2f4f4f">Blundy and Lycett
</font>described his anti-Semitism as 'almost Hitlerian'. From the
late 1990s onwards, his views seemed to become more moderate. In
2007, he advocated <font color="#556b2f">Isratin's one-state solution
</font>to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, stating that &quot;[the
Israeli-Palestinian] solution is the establishment of a democratic
state for Jews and Palestinians...&quot;. This is the basic solution,
or else the Jews will be destroyed in the future because the
Palestinians have [strategic] depth.&quot; Two years later, he argued
that a one-state solution would &quot;transcend old conflicts and
look towards a united future based on common culture and respect&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Gaddafi remained a controversial and
divisive figure on the world stage throughout his life and after his
death. Supporters praised Gaddafi's regime for creating a virtually
classless society through internal reforms. They highlight the
regime's achievements in fighting homelessness and ensuring access to
food and clean drinking water. They point out that under Gaddafi all
Libyans received <font color="#a9a9a9">free </font>education up to
university level and point to the dramatic increase in literacy rates
since the 1969 revolution. Supporters have also praised the
achievements in health care, praising the universal and free health
care provided under Gaddafi's regime, which brought diseases such as
<font color="#dcdcdc">cholera and typhoid under </font>control and
increased life expectancy. Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed
that during the first decade of Gaddafi's rule, the lives of most
Libyans &quot;undoubtedly changed for the better&quot;, as material
conditions and prosperity improved significantly, while Lillian Craig
Harris, <font color="#2f4f4f">a specialist in Libyan studies, </font>noted
that in the early years of Gaddafi's regime, Libya's &quot;national
wealth and international influence soared and the national standard
of living has risen dramatically&quot;. Such high living standards
declined in the 1980s <font color="#556b2f">as a result of economic
stagnation</font>. Gaddafi claimed that his Jamahiriya was a
'concrete utopia' and that he had been appointed 'with the consent of
the people', and some Islamic supporters believed that he had a
barakah. His opposition to Western governments won him the respect of
many <font color="#6b8e23">Euro-American far-right extremists.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Critics labelled Gaddafi &quot;despotic,
cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid&quot;, and Western governments and
the press portrayed him as &quot;a vicious dictator of an oppressed
people&quot;. During the Reagan administration, the United States
considered him 'public enemy No 1', and Reagan famously called him
'<font color="#a9a9a9">mad dog of the Middle East</font>'. According
to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under
Gaddafi's regime because of his extensive control over civilians.
Western commentators typically described Gaddafi's Libya as a 'police
state'. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of
detained political opponents were often denied a fair trial and
sometimes tortured or executed without trial, notably in <font color="#dcdcdc">Abu
Salim </font>prison, the site of an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996
in which HRW estimates that <font color="#2f4f4f">1 270 </font>prisoners
were slaughtered. Dissidents or '<font color="#556b2f">stray dogs'
</font>abroad were publicly threatened with death and sometimes
killed by government hit squads. Human rights activists have also
criticised his government's treatment of non-Arab Libyans, and
Gaddafi's Libya persecuted Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees and
foreign workers. According to journalist Annick Cojean and
psychologist Seham Serwega, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and
imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped
several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's regime was often
criticised for not being democratic, and Freedom House consistently
gave Libya a '<font color="#6b8e23">Not Free</font>' rating for civil
liberties and political rights under Gaddafi.</p>

Although the Turkish Cypriots made up only 18% of the population, the
partition of Cyprus and the creation of a Turkish state in the north
became the policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s.
For a time, Turkish leaders supported the annexation of Cyprus to
Turkey, considering Cyprus as an &quot;extension of Anatolia&quot;.
Since the 19th century, the majority Greek Cypriot population and its
Orthodox Church had sought a union with Greece, which became Greek
national policy in the 1950s. Following nationalist violence in the
1950s, Cyprus gained independence <font color="#2f4f4f">in 1960</font>.
In 1963, 11 years of violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots began, forcing more than <font color="#6b8e23">25 000
</font>Turkish Cypriots to leave their homes and ending Turkish
Cypriot representation in the Republic. On 15 July 1974, Greek
Cypriot nationalists and members of the Greek military junta staged a
coup d'état in an attempt to incorporate Cyprus into Greece. The
action triggered the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the
occupation of what is now northern Cyprus the following month after a
ceasefire broke down and the displacement of more than 150 000 Greek
Cypriots and 50 000 Turkish Cypriots. A separate Turkish Cypriot
state was created in the north in 1983. These events and the
resulting political situation are the subject of ongoing controversy.</p>

Greek nationalism and by the 20th century the idea of an enosis, or

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Greek Cypriot population, on the
other hand, had begun to hope that the British administration would
lead to an enosis. The idea of an enosis was historically part of the
<font color="#a9a9a9">Megali idea</font>, a wider political
aspiration for a Greek state comprising the Greek-inhabited areas of
the former Ottoman Empire, including Cyprus and Asia Minor, with
Constantinople as its capital. It was actively promoted by the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Orthodox Church of Cyprus, </font>whose members
were educated in Greece. These religious officials, together with
Greek military officials and professionals, some of whom continued to
promote the Megali idea, later founded the guerrilla organisation
<font color="#2f4f4f">Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agonisto (EOKA), the
National Organisation of the Fighters of Cyprus. </font>Greek
Cypriots considered the island to be historically Greek and believed

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Initially, Turkish Cypriots were in
favour of the continuation of <font color="#a9a9a9">British </font>rule.
However, the Greek Cypriot demands for enosis worried them, as they
considered the annexation of Crete to Greece, which led to the exodus
of the Turkish Cretans, as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a
pro-partition stance in response to the military action of the EOKA.
The <font color="#dcdcdc">Turkish Cypriots </font>also considered
themselves a distinct ethnic group on the island and believed that
they had a right to self-determination separate from the Greek
Cypriots. At the same time, in the 1950s, the Turkish leader Menderes
considered Cyprus as an &quot;extension of Anatolia&quot;, rejected
the division of Cyprus along ethnic lines and advocated the
annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalist slogans centred
on the idea that &quot;Cyprus is Turkish&quot; and the ruling party
declared Cyprus to be part of the Turkish fatherland, which was vital
for its security. When it was realised that the Turkish Cypriot
population accounted for only <font color="#2f4f4f">20% </font>of the
island's population, annexation was not an option, national policy
was changed to favour partition. The slogan <font color="#556b2f">&quot;partition
or death&quot; </font>was a frequent feature of Turkish Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot demonstrations from the late 1950s and throughout the
1960s. Although after the Zurich and London conferences Turkey seemed
to accept the existence of a Cypriot state and to move away from its
policy of partition, the goal of the Turkish Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot leaders remained the creation of an independent Turkish state
in the north of the island.</p>

in which 96% of the participating Greek Cypriots voted in favour of
enosis. At that time, the Greek population of the island accounted
for <font color="#dcdcdc">80.2% of the </font>total population (1946

based on a constitution, but this was eventually rejected. In <font color="#2f4f4f">1955,

union with Greece through armed struggle. At the same time, the
Turkish Cypriots countered by forming the Turkish Cypriot Resistance
Organisation (TMT), which called for Taksim, or partition. The
British had also adopted a <font color="#556b2f">'divide and rule'
policy </font>at the time. Woodhouse, a British official in Cyprus,
revealed that the then British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan
'urged the British in Cyprus to incite the Turks in order to
neutralise Greek bigotry'. British officials also condoned the
creation of a Turkish underground organisation, T.M.T. In a letter
dated 15 July 1958, the Minister for Colonisation had advised the
Governor of Cyprus not to act against T.M.T., despite its illegal
activities, in order to avoid damaging British relations with the

film, a <font color="#483d8b">140-minute </font>science fiction
adventure called <font color="#3cb371">Firelight, </font>which later
inspired Close Encounters. The film was made <font color="#bc8f8f">for

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">His first professional television
work came when he was hired to direct a segment of a <font color="#dcdcdc">pilot
episode of Night Gallery in </font><font color="#a9a9a9">1969</font>.

friend of </font>Spielberg's until her death. The episode is unusual
in that the camerawork is more stylized than in his later, more
'mature' films. After this and the Marcus Welby, M.D. episode,
Spielberg got his first feature film: <font color="#a0522d">an

</font>This <font color="#8b0000">futuristic </font>sci-fi episode
impressed Universal Studios, who signed him to a short contract. He
did a second episode of Night Gallery and worked on shows like <font color="#3cb371">Owen

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Based on his work, Universal signed
a contract with Spielberg <font color="#a9a9a9">for four </font>TV
films. The first was the Richard Matheson film adaptation Duel. The
film is about a <font color="#dcdcdc">psychotic </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Peterbilt
281 tanker </font><font color="#dcdcdc">driver </font>who chases the
terrified driver of a small Plymouth Valiant (<font color="#556b2f">Dennis
Weaver) </font>and tries to run him off the road. The special praise
for this film by the influential British critic <font color="#6b8e23">Dilys
Powell </font>was highly significant for Spielberg's career. A second
TV film (<font color="#a0522d">Something Evil</font>) was made and
released to capitalise on the popularity of The Exorcist, which was a
big bestseller at the time but had not yet been released as a film.
He fulfilled his contract by directing a TV pilot of the Savage
series, starring <font color="#228b22">Martin Landau. </font>Spielberg's
debut as a feature-length film was The Sugarland Express, about a
married couple being hunted by the police as they try to regain
<font color="#191970">custody of their child. </font>Spielberg's
depiction of the police chase was praised by critics, and The
Hollywood Reporter noted that &quot;a new major director is on the
horizon. &quot;223 However, the film did <font color="#8b0000">poorly
at </font>the box office and received limited distribution.</p>

Steven Spielberg announced that he would direct a scientifically
accurate film from a script by Kip Thorne and producer Lynda Obst
about a &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">team of explorers who travel
through a wormhole to another dimension&quot;</font><font color="#dcdcdc">.
</font>In January 2007, screenwriter <font color="#6b8e23">Jonathan
Nolan </font>met with them to discuss adapting Obst and Thorne's
treatment into a narrative screenplay. The scriptwriter suggested
adding a &quot;time element&quot; to the basic idea of the treatment,
which Obst and Thorne welcomed. In March of that year, Paramount
hired Nolan and scientists from <font color="#a0522d">Caltech to </font>form
a workshop to adapt the treatment under the name Interstellar. In
July of the following year, Kip Thorne said that people were
pressuring him to play himself in the film. Spielberg later dropped
Interstellar, which was eventually directed by <font color="#228b22">Christopher
Nolan</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">His family-friendly works have a
strong theme of childlike, even naïve wonder and faith, as evidenced
by such works as <font color="#a9a9a9">Close Encounters of the Third
Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Hook, A.I. Artificial Intelligence
and The BFG</font>. According to <font color="#dcdcdc">Warren
Buckland</font>, these themes are portrayed through the use of
<font color="#2f4f4f">low-angle camera shots, which have </font>become
one of the hallmarks of Spielberg's directing<font color="#dcdcdc">.
In the </font>cases where his films feature children (<font color="#556b2f">E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park, </font>etc.),
this filming style is more obvious, but it is also used in films such
as Munich, Secret Serviceman Ryan, The Terminal, Minority Report and
Amistad. If you look at each of his films you can see that the
director has used this shot, in particular the water scenes in Jaws
are shot <font color="#6b8e23">from the low angle of a person
swimming.</font> Another child-oriented theme in Spielberg's films is
the loss of innocence and coming of age. In Empire of the Sun, Jim, a
well-groomed and pampered English youth, loses his innocence while
suffering in World War II <font color="#a0522d">China. </font>Similarly,
in Catch Me If You Can, <font color="#228b22">Frank </font>naively
and foolishly believes that he can get his broken family back if he
can raise enough money to support them.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The most enduring theme of his films
is the <font color="#a9a9a9">tension between parent-child
relationships</font>. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent
or ignorant. In Peter Banning's Hook, a reluctant married parent at
the beginning of the film regains the respect of his children as the
film progresses. The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T. is
the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained
relationship with his father, a <font color="#dcdcdc">professor of
medieval literature, who </font>always seemed to be more interested
in his work, particularly his research on the <font color="#2f4f4f">Holy
Grail, </font>than in his own son, although he does not seem to
realise or understand the negative impact his distant nature has had
on Indy (he even believes he was a good <font color="#556b2f">father
</font>in the sense of teaching his son 'self-reliance', which was
not Indy's view). Even Oskar Schindler, from the film Schindler's
List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich portrays
Avner as a man separated from his wife and newborn daughter. There
are exceptions, of course; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man,
while <font color="#6b8e23">John Anderton </font>in Minority Report
is a broken man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is
probably the most autobiographical feature of Spielberg's films, as
Spielberg himself suffered the divorce of his parents as a child and
the absence of his father. In addition to this theme, the main
characters in his films often come from families where the parents
are divorced, such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (the mother of the
main character Elliot is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (<font color="#a0522d">Frank
</font>Abagnale's mother and father divorced early in the film). A
little known is also Tim in Jurassic Park (at the beginning of the
film, another minor character mentions Tim and Lex's parents'
divorce). The often shown family split is often resolved in the
ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father
figures, <font color="#228b22">Tim </font>sees Dr Alan Grant as a
father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return these
fatherly feelings to Tim. By the end of the film, however, he has
changed, and the children even fall asleep with their heads on his
shoulders.</p>

Spielberg is known for his habit of working with actors and

Richard Dreyfuss in several films, including <font color="#a9a9a9">Jaws</font><font color="#dcdcdc">,
Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Always</font>. In addition to
his role in Indiana Jones, Spielberg cast <font color="#2f4f4f">Harrison
Ford </font><font color="#556b2f">as a teacher </font>in E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial (although the scene was eventually cut). Although
Spielberg directed veteran voice actor Frank Welker only once (in
Lost Ark Explorers, in which he voiced many animals), Welker has lent
his voice to several Spielberg-produced productions<font color="#6b8e23">,
from Gremlins </font>to its sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch, as well
as the films Earth Before Time, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and
television series such as <font color="#a0522d">Tiny Toons,

several occasions, playing him in <font color="#228b22">films such as
Secret Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal and Bridge of Spies</font>.
Spielberg has worked with Tom Cruise twice on <font color="#191970">Minority

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A famous example of Spielberg
working with the same professionals is his long-standing
collaboration with <font color="#a9a9a9">John Williams </font>and the
use of his music in all his films since <font color="#dcdcdc">The
Sugarland Express </font>(with the exception of <font color="#2f4f4f">Bridge
of Spies, The Color Purple and Twilight Zone: The Movie</font>). One
of Spielberg's trademarks is the use of Williams' music to enhance
the visual impact of scenes and to try to create a lasting image and
sound of the film in the memory of the audience. These visual scenes
often use images of the sun (e.g. in Empire of the Sun, Saving
Private Ryan, the final scene of Jurassic Park and the closing
credits of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (where <font color="#556b2f">they
ride off into the sunset</font>)), the last two of which feature
Williams' music in that final scene. Spielberg is a contemporary of
<font color="#6b8e23">George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, John Milius and Brian De Palma</font>, collectively known
as &quot;Movie Brats&quot;. In addition to his main directorial role,
Spielberg has produced a remarkable number of films, including early
hits by Joe Dante and Robert Zemeckis. Spielberg has not often worked
with the same screenwriter on his films, with the exception of <font color="#a0522d">Tony

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Some argue that lifts began as
simple cable or chain lifts (see traction lifts below). An elevator
is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed upwards
mechanically. A modern lift consists of a cabin (also called a
&quot;cage&quot;, &quot;carriage&quot; or &quot;trolley&quot;)
mounted on a platform in an enclosed space called a shaft or
sometimes a &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">hoistway&quot;. </font>In the
past, the mechanisms for operating the lift were operated by <font color="#dcdcdc">steam
and water hydraulic pistons or by hand.</font> In a traction lift,
the lifts are pulled up by steel cables that run over a deeply
grooved pulley, commonly called a wire rope in the industry. <font color="#2f4f4f">A
counterweight </font>balances the weight of the lift. Sometimes two
lifts are built so that <font color="#556b2f">their lifts always move
synchronously in opposite directions </font>and counterbalance each
other.</p>

commonly, the doors <font color="#dcdcdc">have two panels that meet
in the middle and slide open sideways. In </font><font color="#2f4f4f">a
cascaded telescopic configuration </font>(which can allow wider
entrances in limited space), the doors move on independent rails so
that when open they are hidden behind each other and when closed they
form cascading layers to one side. This can be configured so that two
sets of such cascading doors operate like the centre-opening doors
described above, allowing the lift car to be very wide. In less
expensive installations, a single large <font color="#556b2f">&quot;slab
door&quot; </font>can also be used: a single-panel door the width of
the doorway that opens to the left or right side. Some buildings have

The brake is mounted between the motor and the gearbox or between the
motor and the pulley or at the end of the pulley to keep the lift

type, <font color="#2f4f4f">spring-actuated </font>and held open

the lift from falling (see inherent safety and security technology).
However, it can also be of some disc type, such as 1 or more fingers

high-speed, high and high-capacity lifts with machine rooms (with the

the cables are attached to a drive plate above the cab</font>, or
they can be 'lowered' below the cab, and then <font color="#a9a9a9">passed
</font>over a drive belt to a counterweight attached to the opposite
end of the cables, which reduces the force required to move the cab.
The counterweight is located <font color="#dcdcdc">in the hoistway
</font>and runs on a separate rail system; as the carriage rises, the
counterweight falls and vice versa. This action is controlled by a
traction machine, which is driven by <font color="#2f4f4f">a
controller</font>, typically a relay logic or computer device that
controls the starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the
lift car. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the
weight of the lift cabin plus <font color="#556b2f">40-50% </font>of
the lift capacity. The grooves in the drive pulley gear are specially
designed to prevent slippage of the wire ropes. &quot;Traction&quot;
is provided to the ropes by the grooves in the turnout, hence the
name. As the ropes age and the drive grooves wear, some of the
traction is lost and the ropes need to be replaced and the wire rope
repaired or replaced. <font color="#6b8e23">Wear on the pulley and
ropes </font>can be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes
are equally taut, so that the load is evenly distributed. A rope
tension gauge is a simple way to equalize rope tension and prolong

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Statistically speaking, <font color="#a9a9a9">cable
lifts </font>are very safe. Their safety record is unrivalled
compared to other vehicle systems. In 1998, it was estimated that
about <font color="#dcdcdc">eight in one million (1 in 12 million) of
all lift journeys </font>were caused by an anomaly, and most of these
were <font color="#2f4f4f">minor issues such as doors not opening. </font>Of
the 20 to 30 lift fatalities that occur each year, most are caused by
maintenance - for example, <font color="#556b2f">technicians leaning
too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts. </font>Most
other deaths are caused by other types of accidents, such as people
blindly stepping through doors that open into an empty shaft, or
being strangled by scarves stuck to the doors. In fact, before the
September 11 attacks, the only known free-fall accident in a modern
cable car occurred in <font color="#6b8e23">1945, when a B-25 bomber
crashed into the Empire State Building </font>in a fog and broke the
cables. The elevator cables fell from the 75th floor to the bottom of
the building, and the only person in the elevator - the operator -
was seriously injured (but not killed). However, in 2007, an incident
at Seattle Children's Hospital in which a ThyssenKrupp ISIS
machine-room-less elevator fell free until the safety brakes were
engaged. This was due to a design flaw in which the cables were
connected to a single common point, and Kevlar ropes tended to
overheat and cause a slip (or in this case a free fall). While it is
possible (though highly unlikely) that a lift rope will break, all
modern lifts are equipped with a number of safety devices to prevent
the lift from free-falling and falling. The cabin of the lift is
usually supported by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in tall buildings)
hoist ropes or slings, each of which alone can carry the full load of
the lift plus 25% more weight. There is also a device that detects
whether the lift is descending faster than its maximum design speed;
if this happens, the device causes the copper (or silicon nitride in
the case of tall buildings) brake shoes to compress along the
vertical rails of the shaft, bringing the lift to a rapid stop, but
not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called a governor,
and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, an oil/hydraulic
or spring bumper or a polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic bumper
or a combination of both (depending on the ride height and speed) is
installed at the bottom of the shaft (or at the bottom of the cab and
sometimes at the top of the cab or shaft) to provide some cushioning
against potential shocks. However, in Thailand in November 2012, a
woman died in a free-falling lift, reportedly the &quot;first legally
recognised death caused by a falling lift&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Past problems with hydraulic lifts
include underground electrolytic destruction of <font color="#a9a9a9">the
cylinder and bulkhead</font>, pipe failures and steering failures.
Single bulkhead cylinders, usually built prior to the <font color="#dcdcdc">1972
ASME A17.1 </font>Elevator Safety Code amendment that required a
second bulkhead with a hollow bulkhead section, could fail
catastrophically. Previously, the code allowed only <font color="#2f4f4f">single-bottom
</font>hydraulic cylinders. In the event of a cylinder failure, fluid
loss would result in <font color="#556b2f">uncontrolled downward
movement of the lift.</font> This results in two major hazards: a
shock at the bottom can occur when the lift stops suddenly, and the
lift can hit the entrance if the operator is partially in the lift.
Since it is impossible to check the system continuously, the rules
require <font color="#6b8e23">regular testing of the pressure
capability.</font> Another solution to prevent the cylinder from
exploding is to install a gripping device on the piston. One
commercially available device is known by the marketing name
&quot;LifeJacket&quot;. This is a device which, in the event of
uncontrolled downward acceleration, grips the piston and stops the
trolley. A device called an overspeed or break valve is attached to
the hydraulic inlet or outlet of the cylinder and adjusted to the
maximum flow rate. If the pipe or hose breaks (ruptures), the flow
rate of the break valve exceeds the set limit and mechanically stops
the flow of hydraulic fluid from the outlet, causing the piston to
stop and the car to come to a downward stop.</p>
