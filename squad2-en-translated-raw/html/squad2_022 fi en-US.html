from the Balkans in the west (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeon) and

from the ashes and was followed in 224 AD by the empire of Alexander

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In <font color="#a9a9a9">633 AD, </font>the
Rashidun Arabs invaded and conquered Iran by <font color="#dcdcdc">651
AD</font>, converting the Iranians largely from their original
beliefs of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism <font color="#2f4f4f">to
Sunni Islam</font>. Arabic replaced Persian as the official language,
but Persian remained the language of both the common people and
literature. Iran became a major player in the golden age of Islam,
producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists and
thinkers. The establishment of the Safavid dynasty in 1501 converted
the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam and made
Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. The Safavid
conversion of Iran from Sunni to Shia marked one of the most
important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. From 1736
onwards, under Nader Shah, Iran achieved its greatest territorial
expansion since the Sassanid Empire and briefly held what was then
arguably the most powerful empire. In the 19th century, Iran
irrevocably lost parts of its territories in the Caucasus, which for
centuries had been part of the concept of Iran, to neighbouring
<font color="#556b2f">Imperial Russia.</font> Popular unrest
culminated in the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906, which
established a constitutional monarchy and the country's first Majles
(parliament). After the British-US coup of 1953, Iran gradually
became a close ally of the US and the rest of the West, remaining
secular but becoming increasingly autocratic. Growing discontent
against foreign influence and political oppression culminated in <font color="#6b8e23">the
1979 revolution, </font>which led to the establishment of the Islamic
Republic on 1 April 1979.</p>

originally referred to the area inhabited by Persians on the western

The <font color="#a0522d">Roman Empire </font>conquered much of

The first <font color="#191970">Anglo-Saxons </font>arrived as Roman

political changes, particularly in England. The Norman conquest of
England in 1066 and the partial Angevin conquest of Ireland from 1169
onwards led to much of Britain and part of Ireland coming under the
rule of a new Norman elite. By the late Middle Ages, Britain had been
divided into the kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control of
Ireland alternated between the Gaelic kingdoms, the Hibernian Normans
and the English-ruled Irish lordship, and was soon confined to The
Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crown, the 1707 Act of Union and the 1800
Act of Union sought to unite Britain and Ireland into a single
political entity, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining under the
Crown. The expansion of the British Empire and the migrations that
followed the Irish Famine and the Highland Clearances led to a
dispersal of the population and culture of the islands around the
world and a rapid depopulation of Ireland in the second half of the
19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom <font color="#3cb371">after

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The British Isles lie at the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The islands are relatively
low-lying, particularly in central Ireland and southern Britain: the
lowest point is <font color="#dcdcdc">Holme, Cambridgeshire, at -2.75
m </font><font color="#2f4f4f">(-9.02 ft)</font>. The Scottish

parts of Ireland, </font>but in these regions only seven peaks reach
over 1 000 m (3 000 ft). Lakes on the islands are generally not
large, although Lough Neagh <font color="#a0522d">in Northern Ireland
is </font>an exception, covering an area of 150 square miles (390
km2). The largest freshwater body in the UK, <font color="#228b22">Loch
Lomond, is </font>27.5 square miles (71 km2) in area and Loch Ness in
volume, while Loch Morar is the deepest freshwater body in the
British Isles, with a maximum depth of 310 metres (1 017 ft). The
British Isles have several large rivers. The longest is the <font color="#191970">River
Shannon </font>in Ireland, which is 360 kilometres (224 mi) long. The
River Severn, 354 kilometres (220 mi) long, is the longest river in
Britain. The islands have a temperate maritime climate. The North
Atlantic Current (&quot;Gulf Stream&quot;) from the Gulf of Mexico
brings considerable humidity and raises temperatures to 11°C (20°F)
above the global average at island latitudes. Winters are cool and
wet and summers are <font color="#8b0000">mild and also humid</font>.
Most of the Atlantic depressions run north of the islands, which,
combined with the general westward flow and land surface, causes the
climate to vary east-west.</p>

Scotland, pine and birch are the most common. Ireland's natural
forests are mainly <font color="#483d8b">oak, ash, elm</font>, birch
and pine. Beech and linden, which are not native to Ireland, are also
common. A wide variety of semi-natural vegetation, such as grasses

The remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, which conquered England, are
still associated with the English Crown to this day in the Channel
Islands. A century later, the marriage of the future Henry II of
England and <font color="#228b22">Eleanor of </font>Aquitaine created
the kingdom of Angevin, which was partly under the French crown. The

</font>at the invitation of a provincial king and under the authority
of Pope Adrian IV (the only Englishman to have been elected Pope).
Although the High King of Ireland was not originally intended to
remain an independent kingdom, the failure of the High King of
Ireland to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Windsor led to Henry
II of England as King of England ruling as de facto monarch with the
title of Lord of Ireland. This title was granted to his younger son,

In Ireland, power alternated between the Gaelic kingdoms, the
Hiberno-Norman Lords and the English dominion of Ireland. A similar
situation prevailed in the Principality of Wales, which was slowly
annexed to the Kingdom of England by a series of Acts. During the
15th century, the English Crown presented its claim to the French
Crown, which also freed the King of England from the vassalage of the
King of France. In 1534, <font color="#a0522d">King Henry VIII, who
had </font>initially been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in
the face of the Reformation, resigned from the Roman Church after
failing to obtain a divorce from the Pope. His response was to make
the King of England 'the only supreme head of the <font color="#228b22">Church
of England </font>on earth', thus removing the Pope's authority from
the affairs of the Church of England. Ireland, which had been held by
the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which had strictly
speaking been in the feudal possession of <font color="#191970">the
Pope </font>since the Norman invasion, was declared a separate
kingdom in personal union with England.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Scotland, meanwhile, had remained an
independent kingdom. In <font color="#a9a9a9">1603, the </font>situation
changed when the King of Scotland inherited <font color="#dcdcdc">the
English crown</font>, and with it the Irish crown. The 1600s that
followed were a <font color="#556b2f">time of </font><font color="#2f4f4f">political
upheaval, religious strife and </font><font color="#556b2f">war</font>.
English colonialism in Ireland in the 1500s was extended by
large-scale Scottish and English settlements in Ulster. Religious
divisions increased, and the English king came into conflict with
Parliament. A key controversy concerned, among other things, <font color="#6b8e23">his
policy of tolerance towards Catholicism</font>. The ensuing <font color="#a0522d">English
Civil War</font>, or <font color="#228b22">War of the Three Kingdoms,
</font>led to a <font color="#191970">revolutionary republic in
</font><font color="#8b0000">England</font>. Ireland, which was
largely Catholic, was essentially loyal to the King. After the defeat
of the Parliamentary army, the widespread distribution of land from
the loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of
the Parliamentary army gave rise to a new rising class which, over
the next 100 years, wiped out the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic
Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was <font color="#483d8b">Protestant
and British, while the </font>common people were largely Catholic and
Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to
come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the King found it
politically impossible to restore all the former landowners' lands in
Ireland. The 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688 repeated similar themes:
the Catholic King pitted religious toleration against the Protestant
Parliament of England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of
Boyne and at the militarily decisive Battle of Aughrim in Ireland.
The resistance held, and the guarantee of religious tolerance was the
cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in an evolving
political climate, the terms of Limerick were overturned, a new
monarchy was installed, and Ireland's new parliament was filled with
a new elite that passed increasingly intolerant punitive laws that
harmed dissenters and Catholics alike.</p>

in preventing the opposition from scoring; and midfielders, who take
the ball from the opposition and keep possession of it to pass it to
their team's strikers. Players who perform these functions are called
field players to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These
positions are further divided according to the area of the field
where the player spends the most time. For example, there are central
defenders and left and right midfielders. Ten field players can be
placed in any combination. The number of players in each position
determines the style of play of the team; more attackers and fewer
defenders creates a more aggressive and attacking game, while the
opposite creates a slower and more defensive style of play. Although
players usually spend most of the game in a particular position,
there are few restrictions on player movement and players can change
position at any time. The formation of a team's players is known as a
<font color="#556b2f">formation</font>. Determining the formation and
tactics of a team is usually the prerogative of <font color="#6b8e23">the
team coach.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">These ongoing efforts contributed to
the creation of The Football Association (FA) in <font color="#a9a9a9">1863,
which </font>met for the first time on the morning of 26 October 1863
<font color="#dcdcdc">in a Masonic tavern </font>in Great Queen
Street, London. The only school represented at the time was
Charterhouse. Five further meetings were held at the Masonic Tavern
between October and December, eventually producing the first
comprehensive set of rules. At the last meeting, the FA's first
treasurer, Blackheath's representative, withdrew his club from the FA
because two draft rules had been removed at the previous meeting: the
first allowed running with the ball in hand and the second allowed
preventing running by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins),
stumbling and holding on. Other English rugby clubs followed suit and
did not join the FA, but formed the Rugby Football Union in <font color="#2f4f4f">1871.
The </font><font color="#556b2f">eleven </font>remaining clubs, under
the leadership of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, adopted the original thirteen
Laws of the Game<font color="#556b2f">.</font> These rules included
the handling of the ball by 'markers' and the absence of a crossbar.
The rules made the game remarkably similar to the Victorian rules of
football that were being developed in Australia at the time. The
<font color="#6b8e23">Sheffield Football Association </font>played by
its own rules until the 1870s, and the Football Association adopted
some of its rules until there was little difference between the
games.</p>

arouses great passion and plays an important role in the lives of
individual fans, local communities and even nations. R. Kapuscinski

consists of <font color="#a9a9a9">two </font>45-minute periods,
called <font color="#2f4f4f">half-time</font>. Each half continues
uninterrupted, which means that the clock does not stop when the ball
is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time between
halves. The end of the match is called full time. <font color="#556b2f">The
referee </font>is the official timekeeper of the match and may take
into account time lost due to substitutions, injured players
requiring treatment or other interruptions. This extra time is called
extra time in the FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as
down time or injury time, although it can also be used synonymously
with injury time. The duration of the extra time is at the sole
discretion of the <font color="#6b8e23">referee</font>. The referee
alone signals the end of the match. In matches in which a fourth
referee is appointed, the referee shall announce towards the end of
half-time how many minutes of extra time he intends to add. The
fourth referee then informs the players and spectators by holding up
a board on which the count is displayed. The referee may extend the
announced extra time. Extra time was introduced in <font color="#a0522d">1891
</font>following an incident in a match between Stoke and Aston
Villa. Stoke were 1-0 down with just two minutes to go and were
awarded a penalty kick. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of
play, and by the time the ball was recovered, 90 minutes had passed
and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of
either half shall be extended until the penalty kick to be taken or
retaken has been taken, so the game must not end with a penalty kick
being taken.</p>

II, George III and George IV, who </font>reigned continuously from

early 20th century in the United Kingdom as <font color="#228b22">Neo-Georgian
</font>architecture, both also known as Georgian Revival
architecture. In America, the term 'Georgian' is generally used to
describe all buildings of the period, regardless of style; in

Baroque style of </font>Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John Vanbrugh,
Thomas Archer, William Talman and Nicholas Hawksmoor, which in fact
continued until at least the 1720s and overlapped with the more
restrained Georgian style. Architect <font color="#dcdcdc">James
Gibbs </font>was in a transitional phase, his earliest buildings
being in the Baroque style, reflecting his time in Rome in the early
1700s, but he adapted his style after 1720. Notable architects who
contributed to the shift to the Baroque were Colen Campbell, author
of the influential <font color="#2f4f4f">Vitruvius Britannicus
</font>(1715-1725), Richard Boyle, the third Earl of Burlington and
his protégé William Kent, Isaac Ware, Henry Flitcroft and the

</font><font color="#a0522d">Leoni, </font>who spent most of his

architects of the early Georgian period were James Paine, Robert
Taylor and John Wood senior. <font color="#191970">The grand tour of
Europe </font>became very common during this period for wealthy
patrons, and the Italian influence remained dominant, although
Hanover Square, Westminster (from 1713), developed and inhabited by
Whigs of the new dynasty at the beginning of the period, seems to
have deliberately adopted German stylistic elements, particularly the
vertical bands connecting the windows, in homage to the German style.</p>

in Britain, as the country already had a large number of churches,
although in the later years of the period the demand for

built were designed internally to <font color="#556b2f">maximise the
audibility and visibility of </font>preaching, so the nave was
usually wider and shorter than in medieval designs, and often there
were no side aisles. New churches often used funnels. In rural
churches in particular, the external appearance generally retained
the familiar features of the Gothic church: a spire or tower, a large
west front with one or more doors, and very large windows along the
nave, but all ornamentation was derived from the classical
vocabulary. If funds permitted, the west façade might have had a
classical <font color="#a0522d">temple portico with columns and a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late <font color="#a9a9a9">1910s
</font>and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention <font color="#dcdcdc">from
mathematics </font><font color="#556b2f">to philosophy of science and
</font><font color="#6b8e23">eventually </font><font color="#a0522d">to
metaphysics</font>. He developed a comprehensive <font color="#228b22">metaphysical
</font>system that departed radically from most of Western
philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of <font color="#191970">processes
</font>rather than material objects, and that processes are best
defined by their relations to other processes, thus rejecting the
theory that <font color="#8b0000">reality is essentially constructed
of independent constituents. </font>Today, Whitehead's philosophical
works - in particular <font color="#3cb371">Process </font><font color="#bc8f8f">and
Reality </font>- are regarded as the foundations of process
philosophy.</p>

Whitehead was born in </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Ramsgate, Kent,

Alfred Whitehead was a <font color="#556b2f">clergyman and headmaster

Whitehead</font><font color="#228b22">, Alfred North's grandfather.</font>
Whitehead himself recalled that both had been very successful
headmasters, but his grandfather was a more exceptional man.
Whitehead's mother was <font color="#191970">Maria Sarah Whitehead,
</font><font color="#8b0000">formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster</font>.
Whitehead was apparently not particularly close to his mother, as he
never mentioned her in any of his writings, and there is evidence

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The final substantive legacy of
Principia Mathematica is <font color="#a9a9a9">contradictory</font>.
It is generally accepted that <font color="#dcdcdc">Kurt </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Gödel's
</font>incompleteness theorem of <font color="#556b2f">1931 </font>showed
conclusively that for <font color="#6b8e23">any set of </font><font color="#a0522d">axioms

mathematics, there would in fact be </font><font color="#228b22">some
mathematical truths that could not be deduced </font><font color="#191970">from
them, </font>and that Principia Mathematica could therefore never
achieve its aims. However, <font color="#8b0000">Gödel could not

often considered to have a <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;</font><font color="#dcdcdc">defining
essence</font><font color="#2f4f4f">&quot; or &quot;core identity</font><font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;
that is </font>immutable and describes what the thing or person
really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as
essentially the same throughout time, and any changes are <font color="#556b2f">qualitative
and secondary to their core identity </font>(e.g. 'Mark's hair has
turned grey as he has grown older, but he is still the same person').
In Whitehead's cosmology, however, the only things that essentially
exist are <font color="#6b8e23">discrete '</font><font color="#a0522d">occasions
of experience' </font><font color="#6b8e23">that overlap </font><font color="#228b22">in
time and space </font><font color="#191970">and together form a
permanent person or thing.</font> On the other hand, what is often
taken in ordinary thinking to be the 'essence of a thing' or the
'identity/identity of a person' is an abstract generalisation of what
is taken to be the most important or significant features of that
person or thing in time. Identities do not define people, <font color="#8b0000">people
define identities</font>. Everything changes from moment to moment,
and to think that something has a 'permanent <font color="#483d8b">core</font>'
ignores the fact that '<font color="#3cb371">all things flow',

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Whitehead pointed to <font color="#a9a9a9">the
limitations of language </font>as one of the main culprits in the
perpetuation of a materialist mindset, and admitted that it can be
difficult to ever completely get rid of such ideas in everyday
speech. After all, every moment of every person's life can hardly be
given a different proper name, and <font color="#dcdcdc">it is </font><font color="#2f4f4f">easy
and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining
essentially the same thing, </font>rather than constantly keeping in
mind that <font color="#556b2f">each thing is a different thing from
what it was a moment ago</font>. <font color="#6b8e23">However, </font>the
limitations of everyday life and everyday discourse <font color="#6b8e23">should
not prevent people from understanding that 'material substances' or
'essences' are a convenient generalised description of </font><font color="#a0522d">a
continuum of </font>particular, concrete processes. No one questions
that a ten-year-old person is quite different when he turns thirty,
and in many ways not at all the same person; Whitehead points out
that it makes <font color="#228b22">no philosophical or ontological

described a universe in which all entities experience, he needed a

Whitehead rejected the theory of representational perception, in
which <font color="#8b0000">the mind has only private perceptions of
other entities.</font> For Whitehead, the term 'prehension' refers to
the fact that the perceiver actually incorporates features of the
perceived thing into himself. In this way, <font color="#483d8b">entities
are constituted by their perceptions and relations </font><font color="#3cb371">rather
than independently of them. </font>Furthermore, Whitehead sees
perception as occurring in <font color="#bc8f8f">two </font>ways,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In higher organisms (such as
humans), these two modes of perception combine in Whitehead's words
into a &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">symbolic reference</font>&quot;
that <font color="#dcdcdc">links appearance and </font><font color="#2f4f4f">causality
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">in a process so automatic that both
humans and animals find it difficult to refrain</font>. To
illustrate, Whitehead uses the example of a human encounter with a
chair. An <font color="#556b2f">ordinary person looks up, sees a
coloured shape and immediately concludes that it is a chair. </font>The
artist, Whitehead suggests, '<font color="#6b8e23">might not have
jumped at the idea of a chair</font>', but <font color="#a0522d">'might
have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful colour and a
beautiful form'.</font> This is not a normal human reaction; most
people categorise objects by habit and instinct without even thinking
about it. Moreover, animals do the same. Using the same example,
Whitehead points out that a dog <font color="#228b22">&quot;</font><font color="#191970">would
have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and jumped on it
using it as such</font><font color="#228b22">&quot;. </font>Thus the
symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perception on the one
hand and causal relations on the other, and that in fact it is <font color="#8b0000">causal
relations that </font>govern a more basic mentality (as the dog
illustrates), while sense perception indicates <font color="#483d8b">a
higher order mentality </font>(as the artist illustrates).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">For Whitehead, the essence of
religion was <font color="#a9a9a9">individual</font>. Although he
acknowledged that individuals can never be completely separated from
their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own
sake before it is an external fact in relation to others. His most
famous remark about religion is that <font color="#dcdcdc">'</font><font color="#2f4f4f">religion
is what the individual does with his solitude </font><font color="#dcdcdc">...
and if you are never solitary, you are never religious'. </font>Whitehead
saw religion <font color="#556b2f">as a system of </font><font color="#6b8e23">universal
truths that transforms human nature</font>. He drew particular
attention to the fact that <font color="#a0522d">while religion is
often a good influence, it is not necessarily good </font>- an idea
he called a &quot;dangerous delusion&quot; (for example, religion may
encourage the violent destruction of adherents of a rival religion).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">While Whitehead saw religion as
beginning <font color="#a9a9a9">in solitude</font>, he also saw
religion as inevitably extending beyond the individual. In line with
his process metaphysics, in which relationships are primary, he wrote
that religion requires <font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;</font>the
realization of<font color="#dcdcdc"> the value of the objective
world, which is a community, derivable from the interrelationships of
its constituents&quot;. In other words, </font>the universe is a
community that makes itself whole through the relationality of each
individual entity to all others - <font color="#2f4f4f">meaning and
value exist not only for the individual itself</font><font color="#556b2f">,
but only in the context of a universal community.</font> Whitehead
further writes that each entity &quot;cannot find such value until it
has combined its individual claim with the claim of the objective
universe. Religion is the allegiance of the world. <font color="#a0522d">Spirit
immediately surrenders to this universal claim and appropriates it to
itself. &quot;In </font>this way, <font color="#191970">the

&quot;Whiteheads have been recruited from among philosophers and

from the most diverse horizons, from ecology to feminism, <font color="#a9a9a9">practices

&quot;</font>Indeed, in recent decades, attention to Whitehead's work
has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals
in <font color="#dcdcdc">Europe and </font>China and coming from
fields as diverse as <font color="#2f4f4f">ecology, physics, biology,

1932-1934 </font>(later published as 'Nature, Man and God'),
Whitehead is one of many emergent evolutionary philosophers with whom
Temple interacts. However, Whitehead's thinking did not receive much
attention outside a small group of mainly American philosophers and
theologians until the 1970s and 1980s, and even today he is not

and a few liberal graduate programmes in theology and philosophy</font>.
Outside these circles, his influence is relatively small and
fragmented, and has generally come mainly <font color="#dcdcdc">through

Whitehead himself. Whitehead was, for example, <font color="#556b2f">Bertrand
Russell's </font>teacher and long-time friend and collaborator, <font color="#556b2f">and
he also taught and supervised Willard Van Orman Quine's doctoral

philosophy, the predominant philosophical trend in English-speaking

admirers in the continental tradition, such as the French
post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly
remarked of Whitehead that <font color="#6b8e23">'</font><font color="#a0522d">he

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Process theology typically
emphasizes the <font color="#a9a9a9">relational nature of God</font>.
Rather than seeing God as indifferent or unfeeling, process
theologians see God <font color="#2f4f4f">as a </font><font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;</font><font color="#2f4f4f">co-agent
who understands</font><font color="#dcdcdc">&quot; and as a being who
is extremely affected by temporal events</font>. Hartshorne points
out that <font color="#556b2f">people would not praise a human ruler
who was unaffected by the joys or sorrows of his followers </font><font color="#6b8e23">-
so why should this be a praiseworthy quality in God? </font>Instead,
<font color="#a0522d">God is the being most affected by the world,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In physics, Whitehead's ideas have
had some influence. He put forward what can perhaps be seen as a dual
view of Einstein's general theory of relativity, see Whitehead's
theory of gravity. It <font color="#a9a9a9">has been </font><font color="#dcdcdc">severely
criticised</font>. Yutaka Tanaka, who argues that the law of gravity
contradicts experimental observations, suggests that Einstein's work
does not in fact refute Whitehead's formulation. <font color="#2f4f4f">Whitehead's
view is now obsolete with the discovery of gravitational waves</font><font color="#556b2f">.
</font>They are <font color="#6b8e23">locally observed phenomena that
largely violate Whitehead's assumption of the local flatness of
space. </font>Thus, <font color="#a0522d">Whitehead's cosmology must
be regarded as a local approximation </font>and his assumption of a
uniform geometry of space and time, in particular Minkowski's, often
as a locally sufficient approximation. An exact replacement of
Whitehead's cosmology would require the acceptance of Riemannian
geometry. Although Whitehead himself paid only secondary attention to
quantum theory, his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to
some physicists in the field. <font color="#228b22">Henry Stapp and
David Bohm </font>are among those whose work Whitehead influenced.</p>

<font color="#a9a9a9">management philosophy and organisational
theory</font>. This has led, in part, to a focus on identifying and
studying the impact of temporal events (as opposed to static things)
in organisations through a discourse of 'organisational theory',
which includes a range of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives
from a number of philosophers. One of the leading figures with an
explicitly Whiteheadian and pan-experientialist stance on management
is <font color="#dcdcdc">Mark Dibben, </font>who works on what he
calls <font color="#2f4f4f">'applied process thinking' </font>to

&quot;the holistic study of life as a continuous active experience,
as opposed to an occasional - and thoroughly passive - event&quot;.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 10</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There are several molecular
mechanisms of antibacterial resistance. <font color="#a9a9a9">Intrinsic
antibacterial resistance </font>may be part of the genetic make-up of
bacterial strains. For example, the <font color="#dcdcdc">antibiotic
target </font>may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired
resistance results from <font color="#2f4f4f">a mutation </font>in
the bacterial chromosome or from the acquisition of extrachromosomal
DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance
mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been
transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of
antibacterial resistance often occurs <font color="#556b2f">through
vertical transfer of </font><font color="#6b8e23">mutations </font>during
growth and through genetic recombination of DNA via horizontal gene
exchange. For example, <font color="#a0522d">antibacterial resistance
genes </font>can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or
species via plasmids carrying these resistance genes. Plasmids
<font color="#228b22">carrying several different resistance genes </font>can
confer resistance to several <font color="#228b22">antibacterials.</font>
Cross-resistance to multiple antibacterial agents can also occur when
the resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene confers resistance
to more than one antibacterial compound.</p>

the term &quot;antibiosis&quot;, meaning &quot;<font color="#556b2f">against
life&quot;, </font>to describe the phenomenon that these early
antibacterial drugs demonstrated. Antibiosis was first described in
1877 in bacteria, when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch discovered that
a bacterium in the air could inhibit the growth of Bacillus
anthracis. American microbiologist <font color="#a0522d">Selman
Waksman </font>later named these drugs antibiotics in 1942. Synthetic
antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and the development of
antibacterials began in Germany by <font color="#228b22">Paul Ehrlich
in </font>the late 1880s. Ehrlich discovered that certain dyes would
stain human, animal or bacterial cells, while others would not. He
then put forward the idea that it might be possible to create
chemicals that would act as selective drugs, binding to bacteria and
killing them without harming the human host. After screening hundreds
of dyes against various organisms, in 1907 he discovered a medically
useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan, now called
arsphenamine.</p>

purifying the first penicillin, penicillin G, in <font color="#a9a9a9">1942,

Purified penicillin had a strong antibacterial effect on a wide range
of bacteria and was of low toxicity to humans. Moreover, unlike
synthetic sulphonamides, biological components such as pus did not
inhibit its activity. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was
unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed
interest in finding antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and
safety. Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in
Medicine with Fleming for the successful development of penicillin as
a therapeutic drug, which Fleming had discovered by chance but was
unable to develop himself. Florey gave Dubos credit for pioneering
the deliberate and systematic search for antibacterial compounds,
which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and revived Florey's
penicillin research.</p>

phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be

make new phages, and as soon as they are ready to be released, the
cell lyses. One concern about using phages to fight pathogens is that
<font color="#556b2f">phages infect 'good' bacteria</font>, bacteria

<font color="#a9a9a9">before Windows 7 was delivered in 2009</font>.
At the <font color="#dcdcdc">Consumer Electronics Show in </font>January
2011, it was announced that the next version of Windows would add
support for ARM system chips alongside the current x86 processors,
notably from AMD and Intel. <font color="#2f4f4f">Steven Sinofsky,
</font>head of Windows, demonstrated an early version of the port on
prototype devices, and Microsoft CEO <font color="#556b2f">Steve

&quot;everywhere and on all kinds of devices without compromise&quot;.
Details also began to emerge about a <font color="#6b8e23">new
application framework for Windows 8, </font>codenamed &quot;Jupiter&quot;,
which would be used to create &quot;immersive&quot; applications
using XAML (along the lines of Windows Phone and Silverlight) that
could be distributed through a new packaging system and a rumoured
app store.</p>

8 were leaked to the public. Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on
<font color="#a9a9a9">12 April 2011</font>. <font color="#dcdcdc">It
was the first build to have window text centered </font><font color="#2f4f4f">instead
of left-aligned</font>. It was also probably the first appearance of
a Metro-style font, and had the text shhh... let's not leak our hard
work. However, its detailed build number reveals that the build was
created on 22 September 2010. The leaked copy was the Enterprise
edition. The operating system still reads &quot;Windows 7&quot;.
Milestone 2, build 7955, was leaked on <font color="#556b2f">25 April
</font>2011. The traditional Blue <font color="#6b8e23">Screen </font>of
Death (BSoD) was replaced by a new black screen, although this was
later removed. This build introduced a new ribbon in Windows
Explorer. Build 7959, which contained minor changes but was the first
64-bit version, was leaked on <font color="#a0522d">1 May 2011</font>.
The &quot;Windows 7&quot; logo was temporarily replaced by text that
read &quot;Microsoft Confidential&quot;. On 17 June 2011, the 64-bit
version of build 7989 was leaked. It introduced a new Start screen
with the same fish as the default Windows 7 Beta wallpaper, which was
later removed, and the circular dots that were present in the final
version (although the final version has a smaller cluster of circular
dots). It also had the text Welcome below them, although this was
also removed.</p>

</font>term &quot;immersive app&quot; internally <font color="#a9a9a9">before
the first official launch of Windows 8, </font>after which they were
called <font color="#dcdcdc">Metro-style apps</font>, referring to
the Metro design language. The term was dropped in August 2012; a
Microsoft spokesperson denied rumours that the change was related to
a potential trademark issue, stating that &quot;Metro&quot; was just
a code name that would be replaced before the release of Windows 8.
Following these reports, the terms &quot;Modern UI-style apps&quot;,
&quot;Windows 8-style apps&quot; and &quot;Windows Store apps&quot;
began to be used for the new apps in various Microsoft documents and
materials. In an interview on <font color="#2f4f4f">12 September
2012, </font>Soma Somasegar (<font color="#556b2f">Vice President of
Microsoft's Software Development Division) </font>confirmed that
'Windows Store apps' would be the official term for apps. On the MSDN
page about the Metro design language, the term &quot;Modern design&quot;
is used to refer to the whole language.</p>

improving usability on tablets and other touchscreen devices. The new

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the release of Windows 8,
Microsoft came under criticism (especially from <font color="#a9a9a9">free
software advocates</font>) for requiring that devices receiving
Windows 8 optional certification have secure boot by default using a
key provided by Microsoft. The concern was that secure boot could
prevent or hinder the use of alternative operating systems such as
Linux. <font color="#dcdcdc">Microsoft developer </font>Tony
Mangefeste, in a post on the Building Windows 8 blog about secure
boot, said that <font color="#2f4f4f">vendors offer ways to customise
secure boot. &quot;At the end of the day, the </font>customer
controls their computer. Microsoft's philosophy is to <font color="#556b2f">provide
the best experience for customers first and let them make the
decisions for themselves. &quot;</font>Microsoft's Windows 8
certification guidelines ultimately revealed that <font color="#6b8e23">vendors
must provide users with the means to reconfigure or disable secure
boot </font>in the device's UEFI firmware. They also showed that on
ARM devices (Windows RT), secure boot must be permanently enabled and
users cannot disable it. The Verge's Tom Warren noted, however, that
other vendors have introduced similar device restrictions in their
own ARM-based tablet and smartphone products (including products
using Microsoft's own Windows Phone platform), but still argued that
Microsoft should &quot;maintain a consistent approach across ARM and
x86 operating systems, not least because many users would like to use
Android alongside Windows 8 in their future tablets&quot;. No mandate
is given for the installation of third-party certificates that would
allow alternative software to run.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Reviews of the different versions of
Windows 8 have been mixed. Tom Warren of The Verge noted that while
Windows 8's emphasis on touch computing is significant and may
alienate desktop users, &quot;a Windows 8-powered tablet makes the
iPad feel instantly outdated&quot; due to the operating system's
hybrid model and focus on cloud computing. The Verge's <font color="#a9a9a9">David
Pierce </font>described Windows 8 as &quot;the first desktop
operating system to understand what a PC should do in 2012&quot;, and
praised Microsoft's uncompromising approach and the operating
system's emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud computing.
Pierce also hailed the Home screen as &quot;a brilliant innovation
for desktop computers&quot; compared to &quot;the folder-lit desktops
of all other operating systems&quot; <font color="#dcdcdc">because it
allows users to interact with dynamic data</font>. The ExtremeTech
article, on the other hand, said that Microsoft &quot;waffles&quot;,
and the PC Magazine review condemned the Metro-style interface. Some
of the apps in Windows 8 were considered simple and lacking in
functionality, while the Xbox apps were praised for their
contribution to the cross-platform entertainment experience. Other
improvements and features (such as <font color="#2f4f4f">file
history, storage and updated task management</font>) were also
welcomed. Ars Technica's Peter Bright wrote that while the UI changes
may be overshadowed by them, Windows 8's improved performance,
updated file management, new storage features, enhanced security
features and updated Task Manager were still positive improvements to
the OS. Bright also said the duality of Windows 8 towards tablets and
traditional PCs was a &quot;very ambitious&quot; aspect of the
platform, but criticised Microsoft for emulating <font color="#556b2f">Apple's
</font>closed distribution platform model when implementing Windows
Store.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Windows 8 user interface has
provoked <font color="#a9a9a9">mixed </font>reactions. Bright wrote
that its hot corners and edge swiping system &quot;wasn't very
obvious&quot; <font color="#dcdcdc">because </font><font color="#2f4f4f">the
OS had no instructions on how to use the interface, </font>not even
in an instructional video included in the RTM release (which
instructed users to simply point to the corners of the screen or
swipe from the sides of the screen). Despite this &quot;stumbling
block&quot;, Bright said the Windows 8 interface worked well in
places, but began to feel inconsistent when switching between Metro
and desktop environments, sometimes in inconsistent ways. The Verge's
Tom Warren wrote that the new UI was &quot;as stunning as it was
surprising&quot; and that it created an incredibly personal
experience once the user had customized it, but that its learning
curve was steep and using it with a keyboard and mouse was awkward.
He said that while forcing all users to use the new touch-based
interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary
to accelerate app development for the Windows Store. Others, such as
ZDNet's <font color="#556b2f">Adrian Kingsley-Hughes</font>, found
the interface &quot;clunky and impractical&quot; due to its
inconsistent design (and even considered it &quot;two operating
systems bolted together&quot;) and stated, that &quot;Windows 8 was
born not out of need or demand, but out of Microsoft's desire to
influence the PC industry and its decision to shape it in a way - for
touchscreens and tablets - that allows it to compete with Apple's
iPad and stay relevant in front of it&quot;.</p>

Net Applications in <font color="#a9a9a9">July </font>2013, Windows 8
overtook Windows Vista in market share with 5.1% adoption, and usage
is steadily increasing. However, Windows 8 still lags behind Windows
Vista and Windows 7 at the same point in their release cycles.
Windows 8's market share on tablets has also been steadily
increasing: according to Strategy Analytics, <font color="#dcdcdc">7.4%
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">of </font>tablets were running Windows
in Q1 2013, compared to none a year earlier. However, this is still
well below the <font color="#556b2f">43.4% </font>and <font color="#6b8e23">48.2%
</font>market share of Android and iOS respectively, although both
operating systems have been on the market much longer than Windows 8.

</font>2014, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft would reduce the price
of Windows 8 licences by 70% for devices retailing for less than USD

with Linux-based devices in the low-cost market, particularly those
running Chrome OS. Microsoft had similarly lowered the price of
Windows XP licenses to compete with the first wave of Linux-based web
machines. According to reports, Microsoft also intended to offer

on Chinese social network <font color="#556b2f">Sina Weibo</font>,
stating that the company has never &quot;assisted any government in
an attack against another government or customers&quot; or provided
customer data to the US government, has never &quot;given any

</font>he distinguished between translation methods that move 'the

</font>and those that move 'the reader towards [the author]', i.e.
<font color="#6b8e23">extreme loyalty to the strangeness of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">It is still disputed <font color="#a9a9a9">whether
the Russians were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs</font>. This
uncertainty is largely due to the paucity of contemporary sources.
Attempts have been made to address the question on the basis of
archaeological evidence, reports from foreign observers, legends and
literature dating back centuries. The controversy is to some extent
linked to the myths of the creation of the present states in the
region. The Normanist view is that the Russians were <font color="#dcdcdc">Scandinavians,
</font>while Russian and Ukrainian ethnohistorians generally claim
that the Russians themselves were <font color="#2f4f4f">Slavs.
</font>Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source on the
Eastern Slavs, the <font color="#556b2f">Russian Primary Chronicle</font>,
although this account was not written until the 13th century.
Nationalist accounts have argued that the Russians were present
before the arrival of the Varangians, that there are only a handful
of Scandinavian words in modern Russian, and that the Scandinavian
names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names.
However, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a
Scandinavian population was present by the 10th century at the
latest. Overall, it seems likely that the actual Russians were a
small minority of <font color="#6b8e23">Scandinavians who </font>formed
the ruling elite, while the majority of their subjects were Slavs.
Given the linguistic arguments put forward by nationalist scholars,
if the inhabitants of the early Russians were Scandinavians, they
must have settled quickly and adopted Slavic languages and other
cultural practices.</p>

of the Russians </font>increased military and economic pressure on
the Khazars, depriving them of territory, subjects and trade. Around
890, <font color="#dcdcdc">Oleg </font>fought an unresolved war in
the Dniester and lower Dnieper regions with the Tiverts and Ulichs,
who probably acted as vassals of the Magyars and prevented the Rus
from reaching the Black Sea. In 894, the <font color="#556b2f">Magyars
and Petsinegs </font>became involved in the wars between the
Byzantine and Bulgarian empires. <font color="#6b8e23">Byzantium
</font>arranged for the Magyars to attack Bulgarian territory from
the north, and Bulgaria in turn persuaded the Petsinegs to attack the
Magyars from their rear. The beleaguered <font color="#a0522d">Magyars
</font>were forced to move further west across the Carpathians to the
Hungarian plain, depriving the Khazars of an important ally and
buffer zone from the Russians. Hungarian migration allowed the
Russians access to the Black Sea, and they soon launched attacks on
Khazar territory along the sea coast, along the Don river and
downstream on the Volga. The Russians raided and pillaged the Caspian
Sea region from 864 onwards, with the first large-scale expedition in
<font color="#228b22">913, </font>when they raided extensively Baku,

no longer able to exact taxes from the Bulgars of the Volga, and
their relations with <font color="#2f4f4f">the Byzantines
deteriorated </font>as Byzantium increasingly allied with the
<font color="#556b2f">Persians </font>against them. The Petsinegs
were thus able to safely raid the Cossack lands from their bases
between the Volga and the Don, allowing them to expand westwards.
Relations between the Rus and the Petshenegs were complex, with the
groups alternately allied with and against each other. The Petshenegs
were nomadic pastoralists roaming the plains, raising <font color="#6b8e23">cattle
</font>which they exchanged with the Rus <font color="#a0522d">for
agricultural and other products. The </font>lucrative trade between
the Russians and the Byzantine Empire passed through
<font color="#228b22">Petsheneg-dominated </font>territory, so
generally peaceful relations were essential. Although the <font color="#191970">primary

in 920. The Petshenegs are said to have assisted the Russians in

the brothers <font color="#a0522d">developed the Glagolitic alphabet</font>,
which later became the Cyrillic alphabet, and standardised the
Slavonic language, later known as Old Church Slavonic. They
translated parts of the Bible and produced the first Slavic civil
code and other documents, and the language and texts spread
throughout the Slavic regions, including Kievan Rus. The missionary
work of Cyril and Methodius served both evangelical and diplomatic
purposes, spreading Byzantine cultural influence in support of
imperial foreign policy. In <font color="#228b22">867 </font>the

depended heavily on <font color="#2f4f4f">trade with </font>Byzantium.
Constantine Porphyrogenitus described the <font color="#556b2f">annual
procession of </font>the princes of Kiev, where they collected
tributes from their client tribes, assembled the goods in a fleet of
hundreds of boats, transported them along the Dnieper to the Black
Sea and sailed to the Dniester estuary, the Danube delta and on to
Constantinople. On their return journey, they carried silk fabrics,
spices, wine and fruit. The importance of this trade relationship led
to military action in the event of disputes. According to the primary
chronicle, the <font color="#6b8e23">Russians invaded Constantinople
again </font>in <font color="#a0522d">907</font>, probably to secure
the trade link<font color="#a0522d">.</font> The chronicle praises
Oleg's military skill and cunning, and the story is full of legendary
details. The Byzantine sources do not mention the invasion, but two
treaties of <font color="#228b22">907 and </font>911 provide for a
trade agreement with the Russians, the terms of which suggest that
the Byzantines exerted pressure by granting the Russians

</font><font color="#2f4f4f">ships</font>, including allies of the
Petsinegs, landed on the coast of Bithynia and destroyed the Asian
coast of the Bosporus. The attack was well timed, perhaps due to
intelligence, as the <font color="#556b2f">Byzantine fleet was busy
</font>in the Mediterranean <font color="#556b2f">with the Arabs, and
the </font>bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus burned
towns, churches and monasteries, slaughtered people and gathered
loot. The emperor arranged for a small number of retired ships <font color="#6b8e23">to
be equipped with </font><font color="#a0522d">Greek fire-throwers</font>,
and sent them against the Russians, enticing them to surround the
contingent before Greek fire was released. The Cremonese Liutprand
wrote that &quot;on seeing the flames, the Russians jumped overboard,
preferring water to fire. Some sank under the weight of their
breastplates and helmets, others caught fire.&quot; Those caught were
beheaded. This stunt scattered the Russian fleet, but their attacks
continued inland as far as Nicomedia, and many atrocities are
reported to have taken place, with victims being crucified and
targeted. Finally, the Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to
drive the Russians back, and the naval forces were said to have
destroyed much of the Russian fleet on their return (possibly an
exaggeration, as the Russians soon launched another attack). The end
result shows that Byzantine military power has increased since <font color="#228b22">911</font>,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Vladimir had been Prince of <font color="#a9a9a9">Novgorod
</font>when his father Svyatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to
flee <font color="#dcdcdc">to Scandinavia </font>in <font color="#2f4f4f">976
after </font>his half-brother Yaropolk murdered his other brother
Oleg and seized power in Russia<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font> In
Scandinavia, Vladimir, with the help of his kinsman Earl Håkon
Sigurdsson, the ruler of Norway, assembled a Viking army and
recaptured Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev,
Vladimir's most significant achievement was the Christianisation of
Kiev Rus, which began in <font color="#556b2f">988. </font>The
Primary Chronicle tells us that, having decided to adopt a new faith
in place of the traditional Slavic idolatry (paganism), Vladimir sent
some of <font color="#6b8e23">his most respected advisers </font>and
warriors as emissaries to various parts of Europe. They visited
Christians, Jews and Muslims in the Latin Rite before finally
arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other
things, it forbade the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because
the Jewish god had allowed his chosen people to be dispossessed of
their land. They found the ceremonies of the Roman Church boring. But
in Constantinople they were so struck by the beauty of the Hagia
Sophia Cathedral and the liturgical worship there that they made up
their minds there and then as to which religion they would follow. On
their return home, they convinced Vladimir that the Byzantine rite
was the best choice of all, and Vladimir then made a trip to
Constantinople and arranged a marriage with <font color="#a0522d">Princess
Anna</font>, sister of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Vladimir's choice of Eastern
Christianity may also have <font color="#a9a9a9">reflected his close
personal ties to Constantinople</font>, which controlled the Black
Sea and thus trade on Kiev's most vital trade route, the <font color="#dcdcdc">Dnieper
River</font>. Support for the Eastern Church had far-reaching
political, cultural and religious consequences. The church had a
liturgy written in <font color="#2f4f4f">Cyrillic letters </font>and
a series of translations from Greek for the Slavic peoples. This
literature <font color="#556b2f">facilitated </font><font color="#6b8e23">the
conversion of </font>Eastern Slavs <font color="#6b8e23">to
Christianity </font>and introduced them to rudimentary Greek
philosophy, science and historiography without the need to learn
Greek (some merchants traded with Greeks and probably understood
modern business Greek). Instead, educated people in medieval Western
and Central Europe learned Latin. Independent of Roman authority and
free from the teachings of Latin scholarship, the Eastern Slavs
developed their <font color="#a0522d">own literature and visual arts,
which </font>differed considerably <font color="#a0522d">from</font>
those of other Eastern Orthodox countries (see the section on the
Middle Ages and the Middle East). After the Great Schism of 1054, the
Church of Rus maintained contact with both Rome and Constantinople
for a time, but like most Eastern churches eventually broke away and
followed the Eastern Orthodox. Nevertheless, unlike the rest of the
Greek world, Rus' in Kiev was not very hostile to the West.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Yaroslav</font>,
known as '<font color="#dcdcdc">the wise</font>', fought for power
with his brothers. He was the son of <font color="#2f4f4f">Vladimir
the Great, and was the </font>vice-regent of Novgorod when his father
died in 1015. His eldest surviving brother, Svyatopolk the Cursed,
then killed his other three brothers and seized power in Kiev.
Yaroslav, with the active support of the Novgorodians and the help of
Viking mercenaries, defeated Svyatopolk and became Grand Duke of Kiev
in 1019. Although he consolidated power in Kiev for the first time in
<font color="#556b2f">1019</font>, it was not until <font color="#6b8e23">1036
that </font>he gained undisputed power over the whole of Kiev Rus.
Like Vladimir, Yaroslav wanted to improve <font color="#a0522d">relations
with the rest of Europe</font>, especially the Byzantine Empire.
Yaroslav's granddaughter Eupraxia, daughter of his son Vsevolod I,
Prince of Kiev, married the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. Yaroslav
also arranged the marriages of his sister and three daughters to the
kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav published the
first Eastern Slavic legal code, the Russkaya Pravda, built the
Cathedral of St Sophia in Kiev and the Cathedral of St Sophia in
Novgorod, protected the local clergy and monastic community, and is
said to have established a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed
the large Pechersk Lavra (monastery) in Kiev, which served as an
ecclesiastical academy in Kiev, Russia.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The principality of Halych in the
south-west had developed trade relations with its <font color="#a9a9a9">Polish,
Hungarian and Lithuanian </font>neighbours and had become the local
successor to Kievin Rus. In 1199, <font color="#dcdcdc">Prince Roman
Mstislavich </font>united the two previously separate principalities.
In <font color="#2f4f4f">1202, </font>he conquered Kiev and took over
the title of Grand Duke of Kiev Russia, which had been held by the
Vladimir-Suzdal rulers since 1169. His son, Prince Daniil (r.
<font color="#556b2f">1238-1264), sought </font>support from the
west. He accepted the papal crown of Rome as 'Rex Rusiae' ('King of
Russia'), apparently without breaking the treaty with Constantinople.
In 1370, the Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in
Constantinople granted <font color="#6b8e23">the Polish king
metropolitan status to his Russian subjects.</font> The rulers of
Lithuania also requested and soon afterwards received a
metropolitanate in Novagrudok. <font color="#a0522d">Cyprian, the
</font>candidate promoted by the Lithuanian rulers, became
Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and Metropolitan of Moscow in 1382, thus
uniting the Church of the Russian lands for a time. In 1439, Kiev
became a separate 'Metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia and All Russia' for
all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The rivalry between Nintendo and
Sega led to one of the most significant console wars in video game
history, with Sega presenting the Genesis as a <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;cool&quot;
console </font>with <font color="#dcdcdc">more mature games </font>aimed
at <font color="#2f4f4f">older gamers </font>and edgy ads that
sometimes attacked competitors. However, Nintendo gained an early
public relations advantage by securing the first console version of
Capcom's arcade classic Street Fighter II for the SNES, which took
over <font color="#556b2f">a year </font>to make the transition to
Genesis. Despite Genesis' head start, much larger game library and
lower price, Genesis' share of the US 16-bit console market was
estimated at only <font color="#6b8e23">60 % in </font>June 1992, and
neither console was able to maintain its ultimate leadership for
several years. <font color="#a0522d">Donkey Kong Country </font>is
said to have <font color="#228b22">helped strengthen the market
position of the SNES in the latter years of the 16-bit generation </font>and
to have maintained its position against the PlayStation and Saturn
for some time. According to Nintendo, the company had sold <font color="#191970">more
than 20 million </font>SNES units in the United States. According to
a 2014 report by Wedbush Securities, based on NPD sales data, the

while </font>PAL operates at <font color="#2f4f4f">50 Hz</font>,
resulting in approximately <font color="#556b2f">16.7% slower
</font>playback. In addition, the higher resolution of PAL results in
<font color="#6b8e23">a letterboxed look to the output image.</font>
Some commercial releases in the PAL range have this same problem, and
therefore can be played on NTSC systems without problems, while on
other NTSC consoles, playback speeds up by 20%. To correct this
problem, a <font color="#a0522d">switch can be added to set the SNES
PPU to 60 Hz mode, which is supported by most newer PAL TVs.</font>
Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run it, requiring
the switch to be turned on only after the check is complete.</p>

</font><font color="#dcdcdc">Akkadian first appears in the </font><font color="#2f4f4f">real
names of the kings of Kish </font>around 2800 BC, which have survived
in later <font color="#556b2f">king lists</font>. There are <font color="#6b8e23">texts

even then most of the administrative tablets were still written in
<font color="#228b22">Sumerian</font>, the language used by scribes.
Gelb and Westenholz distinguish three phases of the Old Akkadian
language: the pre-Sargonic period, the Akkadian Empire and the
subsequent 'Neo-Sumerian Renaissance'. Akkadian and Sumerian
coexisted as vernacular languages for <font color="#191970">about
1,000 years</font>, but by about 1800 BC <font color="#8b0000">Sumerian
</font>was becoming more of a literary language, known mainly only to
scholars and scribes. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is
little historical continuity between the pre-Sargon and post-Sargon
periods and that too much emphasis has been placed on the notion of a
'Semitic vs. Sumerian' conflict. However, it is certain that the
Akkadian language was also conquered for a short period in the
neighbouring regions of Elam, which had been conquered earlier by
Sargon.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Sumerian religion seems to have been
based on <font color="#a9a9a9">two </font>separate <font color="#dcdcdc">cosmogenetic
myths. </font>According to the first, creation was the result of a
series of <font color="#2f4f4f">hieros gami</font>, sacred marriages
involving the reconciliation of opposites and the coming together of
male and female deities, the gods. This continued to influence the
whole Mesopotamian myth. Thus, in Enuma Elish, creation was seen as a
union of <font color="#556b2f">fresh and salt water</font>, of the
male Abzu and the female Tiamat. The resulting Lahm and Lahmu, '<font color="#6b8e23">muddy
ones', were the </font>names given to the gatekeepers of Enki's
E-Abzu temple in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way
in which the mud islands were formed at the confluence of fresh and
salt water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited
its load of mud, the second hieros gamos presumably created Anshar
and Kishar, the 'heaven's joint' or axis, and the 'earth's joint',
which were in turn the parents of Anu (heaven) and Ki (earth).
Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was the hieros gamos between
Ki, known here as <font color="#a0522d">Ninhursag </font>or 'sacred
mountain', and Eridu Enki, the fresh water god who gave birth to
greenery and pasture.</p>

the family's integration into New Zealand society and the fact that

time since the global financial crisis, driven by private retail
sales and education spending. We expect growth to pick up slowly&quot;.
The IMF's 2014 Country Report noted that Tuvalu's real GDP growth has
been volatile, averaging just 1% over the past decade. The 2014

The </font>proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states that 'the most

</font>Since Mary was therefore always free from original sin, the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Mary's total sinlessness and the
consequent freedom from all stains from the first moment of her
existence was a familiar doctrine to <font color="#a9a9a9">Byzantine
Greek theologians</font>. From <font color="#dcdcdc">St Gregory of
Nazianzus </font>onwards, <font color="#dcdcdc">his explanation of
the 'purification' of Jesus and Mary </font>at <font color="#2f4f4f">the
circumcision </font>(<font color="#556b2f">Luke </font>2:22) led him
to hold that the primary meaning of <font color="#6b8e23">'purification'
</font>in Christology (and more broadly in Mariology) refers to a
totally sinless nature, manifested in glory at the moment of grace
(e.g. Jesus at his baptism). <font color="#a0522d">St Gregory
Nazianzen </font>called Mary &quot;prokathartheisa (pre-purified)&quot;.
Gregory probably sought to solve the mystery of the purification of
Jesus and Mary in the temple by considering the human natures of
Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this
way in grace and glory. Gregory's teachings on the purification of
Mary were probably related to the commemoration of <font color="#228b22">the
Mother of God </font>that burst forth in Constantinople and its
environs very close to the Christmas season. Nazianzen's name for the
moment of Mary's apparition as 'pre-purified' was subsequently used
by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the
Byzantine equivalent of the immaculate conception. This is
particularly evident in the case of the Jerusalem Fathers Sophronius
and John Damascene, who are discussed later in this article in the
section on the Churches. Around the time of Damascus, the public
celebration of &quot;the conception of St. Anne [i.e. the Virgin Mary
in her womb]&quot; was becoming popular. After this period, the
&quot;purification&quot; of the full natures of Jesus and Mary would
no longer involve only moments of grace and glory in the context of
incarnation and baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical
celebrations, but <font color="#191970">purification was eventually
associated with the celebration of Mary's conception itself </font>(along
with her presentation in the temple <font color="#8b0000">as an
infant</font>) by 2nd millennium Orthodox writers (e.g., St. Nicholas
Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although the doctrine of <font color="#a9a9a9">Mary's
immaculate conception </font><font color="#dcdcdc">appears only later
among Latin (and especially Frankish) theologians</font>, it became
increasingly prominent among Byzantine theologians of the medieval or
Byzantine East, based on the Mariology of Gregory Nazianzen. Although
hymnographers and scholars, such as <font color="#2f4f4f">the Emperor
Justinian I, </font>used to <font color="#556b2f">call Mary
'pre-purified' in </font>their poetic and confessional utterances,
the first starting point for a more comprehensive commentary on the
meaning of Nazianzenus is found in Sophronius of Jerusalem.
Elsewhere, <font color="#6b8e23">Sophronius </font>explains that
Theotokos was already immaculate when <font color="#a0522d">he was
&quot;purified&quot; at the time of Mary's apparition, </font>and
even goes so far as to point out that John the Baptist is literally
&quot;<font color="#228b22">holier than all 'men' born of woman</font>&quot;,
since Mary's transcendent holiness implies that she was even holier
than John after his sanctification in the womb. <font color="#191970">Sophronius'
</font>teaching is complemented and incorporated by <font color="#8b0000">St
John Damascene </font>(d. 749/750). In addition to praising Theotokos
in many passages for his purification in the Book of Revelation, John
gives him the unique honour of 'purifying the waters of baptism by
touching them'. This honour is most famously and first given to
Christ, especially in the Nazianzen tradition. As such, Nazianzene's
assertion of a parallel holiness between the pre-purified Mary and
the purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in
the Damascene in his discussion of Mary's holiness to also imitate
Christ's baptism in the Jordan. <font color="#483d8b">The Damascene
hymnal and De fide Orthodoxa </font>explicitly use Mary's
&quot;pre-purification&quot; as the key to understanding her absolute
holiness and immaculate human nature. In fact, the Damascene (along
with the Nazianzene) serves as the source for almost all subsequent
promotion of Mary's perfect holiness through her conception from the
'all-pure seed' of Joachim and the 'heaven-expanding' womb of St
Anne.</p>

the same time, </font>he takes the opportunity to completely reject
the view that the conception of<font color="#a0522d"> Mary </font>was
sinless. However, it is questionable whether he uses the term

Pius IX</font>'s definition. Bernard seems to have been speaking of
<font color="#191970">conception in the active sense of maternal
copulation</font>, for in his argument he states: &quot;<font color="#8b0000">How
can there be sinlessness if there is concupiscence (libido)?&quot;. </font>&quot;

its historical starting point from Sophronius, Damascene and their
imitators.</font> The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian who
suggested the immaculate conception of Mary was St Gregory Palamas.
Although many passages in his works have long been known to praise
and attribute to Mary a Christ-like holiness in her human nature,
traditional objections to Palamas' approach to the immaculate
conception typically concern a poor understanding of his doctrine of
the &quot;purification of Mary&quot; at the time of Mary's
apparition. Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzenus
when discussing the purification of Jesus in baptism and the
purification of Mary at the moment of Mary's apparition, but also
Nicaean Theophanes, Josephus Bryennius, and Gennadios Scholarios all
explicitly placed Mary's conception at the first moment of her
participation in divine energies in a completely immaculate way, to
the extent that she was always completely immaculate and graced.
Besides Emperor Manuel II and Gennadios Scholarios, St. Mark of
Ephesus also fiercely defended the title of Mary as &quot;pre-purified&quot;
against Dominican Manuel Calecas, who perhaps promoted a Thomistic
Mariology that denied Mary's all holiness from the first moment of
her existence.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The dry lands of Namibia were
inhabited from early times by the Sani, Damara, Nama and, from about
1300 AD, the Bantu, who came with the Bantu expansion from Central
Africa. From the late <font color="#a9a9a9">1700s, the </font>Orlam
clans from the Cape Colony crossed <font color="#dcdcdc">the Orange
River </font>and moved into what is now <font color="#2f4f4f">southern
Namibia. </font>Their encounters with the <font color="#556b2f">pastoral
</font>Nama tribes were largely peaceful. The missionaries who came
with the Orlam were well received and were granted access to water
sources and grazing land for an annual fee. On their way north,
however, the Orlamis encountered Herero clans in Windhoek, Gobabis
and Okahandja who were less receptive. The Nama-Herero War broke out
in <font color="#6b8e23">1880</font>, and hostilities only subsided
when <font color="#a0522d">Imperial Germany </font>sent troops into

territory, it never officially did so, although it was effectively
administered as a 'fifth province' where the white minority had
representation in South Africa's whites-only parliament and elected
its own local government, the SWA Legislative Assembly. The South
African government also appointed a SWA Administrator with wide
powers. After the United Nations replaced the Alliance in <font color="#2f4f4f">1946</font>,
South Africa refused to relinquish its previous mandate, which was
replaced by a United Nations Trusteeship Agreement that provided for
closer international supervision of the administration of the region
(as well as a definitive timetable for independence). The <font color="#556b2f">Herero

it to grant Namibia independence in the 1950s. As the European powers
granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in

under increasing pressure to do the same for Namibia. <font color="#6b8e23">In

and Mexico. Bloomberg Markets ranked the top 20 countries based on
more than a dozen criteria. The data came from Bloomberg's own
financial market statistics, IMF forecasts and World Bank data.
Countries were also assessed in areas of particular interest to
foreign investors: ease of doing business, perceived levels of
corruption and economic freedom. In order to attract foreign
investment, the government has worked to <font color="#6b8e23">reduce
red tape caused by excessive </font>government regulations<font color="#6b8e23">,
making </font>the country <font color="#a0522d">one of the least

customs sometimes require facilitation fees due to cumbersome and
costly customs procedures. The World Bank has classified Namibia as
an upper middle-income country, ranking it 87th out of 185 economies
in terms of ease of doing business.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Russian is a Slavic language of the
Indo-European language family. It is a direct descendant of the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Kievan Rus </font><font color="#a9a9a9">language</font>.
In terms of spoken language, its closest relatives are <font color="#2f4f4f">Ukrainian</font><font color="#556b2f">,
Belarusian and Russian, the </font>other three languages of the
Eastern Slavic group. In many parts of <font color="#6b8e23">eastern
and southern Ukraine and Belarus </font>these languages are spoken
interchangeably, and in some areas traditional bilingualism has led
to language mixing, for example Surzhyk <font color="#a0522d">in
eastern Ukraine </font>and Trasianka <font color="#228b22">in
Belarus. The </font>Old Novgorod dialect of Eastern Slavs, which
disappeared <font color="#191970">in the 15th or 16th century, </font>is
sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the
formation of <font color="#8b0000">modern Russian. </font>Russian
also has considerable lexical similarities with Bulgarian, due to the
common influence of Church Slavonic on both languages and later
interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, although Bulgarian has a
grammar that is clearly different from Russian. In the 19th century,
the language was often called &quot;Great Russian&quot; to
distinguish it from Belarusian, then called &quot;White Russian&quot;,
and <font color="#483d8b">Ukrainian</font>, then called &quot;Little

</font>Although most of the settlers left after the United States

remain. There are also significant Russian-speaking communities in
North America, particularly in the major urban centres of the US and
Canada, such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles,
Nashville, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Toronto, Baltimore,
Miami, Chicago, Denver and Cleveland. In many places, they publish
their own newspapers and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the

1900, especially in terms of vocabulary and pronunciation, there are
still several dialects in Russia. Some linguists divide Russian
dialects into two primary regional groups, <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;northern&quot;

(the Eastern Russian or Moscow region, which roughly consists of the
present-day Central and North-Western Federal districts) and dialects
of secondary formation (the rest of the region). The internal Russian

stability </font>ensures the safety, security and efficiency of
nuclear activities. Because of their political and military
significance, their destructive power and the potential consequences
of an accident or unauthorised act, nuclear weapons and nuclear

risks and threats associated with their peacetime and wartime
environment. The Air Force, in conjunction with other <font color="#dcdcdc">DoD

protection through a rigorous nuclear security program. The program
addresses materials, personnel, and procedures that promote nuclear
security, safeguards, and controls to ensure that nuclear accidents,

</font>transport aircraft are typically used to deliver troops,
weapons and other military supplies by a variety of methods to any
military theatre of operations around the world, usually outside
commercial air routes in uncontrolled airspace. The USAF Air Mobility
Forces workplanes are the <font color="#dcdcdc">C-130 Hercules, C-17

defined by their range as strategic airlift aircraft (C-5),
strategic/tactical (C-17) and tactical (C-130) to meet the needs of
the ground forces they mostly support. The Air Force uses the CV-22
<font color="#2f4f4f">at the </font>US Special Operations Command
(USSOCOM). It performs long-range special operations missions and is
equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks and a terrain observation radar.
Some aircraft serve in special transport roles, such as executive and
embassy support (C-12), Antarctic support (<font color="#556b2f">LC-130H)
</font>and USSOCOM support (C-27J, C-145A and C-146A). WC-130H

USAF culture as a combination of rigorous application of advanced
technology, individualism and progressive Air Force theory. <font color="#a9a9a9">Major
General Charles J. Dunlap Jr. </font>adds that the culture of the US
Air Force also includes a sense of equality, which stems from
officers seeing themselves as the primary &quot;warriors&quot; of
their unit, working alongside small groups of enlisted Air Force
soldiers who serve either as service crew or aircrew. Air Force
officers have never felt the need for formal social &quot;distance&quot;
from their enlisted troops that is common in other US armed forces.
Although the paradigm is shifting, the Air Force has for most of its
history been an <font color="#dcdcdc">organisation where, </font>unlike
its internal forces, it has <font color="#dcdcdc">fought mainly with
officers</font>, not enlisted soldiers, the latter of whom have been
<font color="#2f4f4f">mainly back-up troops</font>. When enlisted men
were put in harm's way, as in the case of members of multi-crew

created traditions that shaped a somewhat different relationship
