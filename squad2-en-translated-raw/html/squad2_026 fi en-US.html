microscopic larvae and reptiles to small crustacean adults, with the

prey on other ctenophores with huge mouths with <font color="#bc8f8f">large,

huge populations in the same area, because they specialise in

<font color="#bdb76b">externally</font>, although <font color="#4682b4">platyctenid
</font>eggs are fertilised inside the body of their parents and
remain there until hatching. The young are usually planktonic, and in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Cydippid tentacles are typically
flanked by <font color="#a9a9a9">tentilles </font>(&quot;small
tentacles&quot;), although some families have simple tentacles
without these side branches. The tentacles and tentacles are densely
covered with microscopic colloblasts, which attach to prey by
grasping it. Colloblasts are <font color="#dcdcdc">specialised
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">sponge-shaped </font><font color="#dcdcdc">cells
in the outermost layer of the epidermis and </font>have <font color="#556b2f">three
</font>main components: a dome-shaped head with <font color="#6b8e23">vesicles
</font>(chambers) containing <font color="#a0522d">adhesive
substances</font>; a stem that anchors the cell to the lower layer of
the epidermis or mesoglea; and a spiral that wraps around the stem
and is attached to the head and the root of the stem. The function of
the thread is not clear, but it may dampen stress when the prey tries
to escape, preventing the collobast from tearing apart. In addition
to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on
jellyfish, incorporate stinging nematocytes into the tentacles of
their prey - some mollusc-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate
nematocytes into their bodies for defence. The tentacles of
euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: <font color="#228b22">they
have striated muscles</font><font color="#191970">, a </font>cell
type not otherwise known in the genus Ctenophora, and are coiled in a
relaxed manner, whereas the tentacles of all other known ctenophores
are stretched in a relaxed manner. The tentacles of euploquamids <font color="#483d8b">move
in </font><font color="#8b0000">three </font><font color="#483d8b">different
ways </font>used <font color="#3cb371">to catch prey</font>: they can
swing very quickly (40-60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which can
attract prey by behaving like small plankton worms; and they wrap
around prey. The unique flapping movement is a coiling movement,
powered by contraction of striated muscle. The wriggling movement is
produced by smooth muscles, but they are of a very specialized type.
Wrapping around the prey is largely accomplished by returning the
tentacles to their inactive state, but smooth muscle can tighten the
coils.</p>

Ctenophores have been compared to spiders for their many different
predatory techniques - some hang motionless in the water using their
tentacles as 'webs', some are ambush predators like salticid jumping
spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet on the end of a fine
thread, as bolas spiders do. This diversity explains the wide range
of body shapes in a tribe with relatively few species. The bipedal
&quot;cydippid&quot; <font color="#8b0000">Lampea </font>feeds
exclusively on salps, which are close relatives of sea spiders and
form large chain-like floating colonies, and young Lampea spiders
attach themselves as parasites to salps that are too large for them
to swallow. Members of the Pleurobrachia and Bolinopsis genera often
reach high population densities in the same place and at the same
time, because they specialise in different types of prey: the long
tentacles of Pleurobrachia predominantly catch relatively strong
swimmers such as adult <font color="#483d8b">aquatic turtles</font>,
while Bolinopsis usually feed on <font color="#3cb371">smaller,

has been <font color="#dcdcdc">debated for </font>many years.
Ctenophores have been claimed to be a sister lineage to <font color="#2f4f4f">Bilateria</font>,
a sister lineage to Cnidaria, a sister lineage to Cnidaria, Placozoa
and <font color="#556b2f">Bilateria</font>, and a sister lineage to

absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g.
homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, Wnt signalling pathway and sodium
channels) showed that the latter two scenarios, i.e. that ctenophores
are either sister lines to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister
lines to all other animal families, are consistent. Several more
recent studies comparing the complete sequenced genomes of
ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported
the status of ctenophores as sister lineages to <font color="#6b8e23">all
other animals</font>. This position would suggest that neural and
muscle cell types either disappeared from the major animal lineages
(e.g. Porifera) or that they evolved <font color="#a0522d">independently
</font>in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have
argued that the placement of Ctenophora as a sister to all other
animals is a statistical anomaly due to the high rate of evolution of
the ctenophore genomes, and that <font color="#228b22">Porifera
</font>(fungi) is instead the <font color="#191970">earliest diverged

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since all modern ctenophores except
<font color="#a9a9a9">beroids </font>have cydippid-like larvae, it is
widely assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled
cydippids, with an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable
tentacles. A <font color="#2f4f4f">purely morphological </font>analysis
by <font color="#dcdcdc">Richard </font>Harbison in 1985 concluded
that cydippids <font color="#556b2f">are not </font><font color="#6b8e23">monophyletic</font>,
i.e. they do not contain all the descendants of one common ancestor
and only one, which was itself a cydippid. Instead, he found that
different families of cydippids more closely resembled <font color="#a0522d">members
of other ctenophore orders </font>than other cydippids. He also
suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was
either a cydippid or a beroid. A 2001 molecular phylogeny analysis
using <font color="#228b22">26 </font>species, including four
recently discovered species, confirmed that cydippids are not
<font color="#191970">monophyletic </font>and concluded that the last
common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also
found that the genetic differences between these species were very
small - so small that the relationships between Lobata, Cestida and
Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last
common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and
perhaps lucky enough to survive <font color="#8b0000">the
Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinction </font><font color="#483d8b">65.5
million years ago</font>, when other lineages were wiped out. When
the analysis was extended to include representatives of other tribes,
it was concluded that molluscs are probably more closely related to
bipeds than either group is to ctenophores, but this diagnosis is
uncertain.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The popular district known as the
Tower District is centred around the historic <font color="#a9a9a9">Tower
Theatre</font>, which is on the National List of Historic Places. The
theatre was built in <font color="#dcdcdc">1939 and is </font>located
at the <font color="#2f4f4f">corner of Olive and Wishon </font>Avenues
in the heart of the Tower District (the name of the theatre refers to
a well-known landmark, the <font color="#556b2f">Water Tower, which
is </font>actually located in another nearby area). The Tower
District neighborhood is north of downtown Fresno proper and <font color="#6b8e23">a
half-mile </font>south of Fresno City College. Although the district
was known as a residential neighborhood in the past, the Tower
District's early commercial establishments began as small shops and
services that came to the area shortly after World War II. The
character of local small businesses has largely survived to the
present day. To some extent, Tower District businesses developed due
to the proximity of the original <font color="#a0522d">Fresno Normal
School </font>(later renamed California State University at Fresno).
In <font color="#228b22">1916, </font>the college moved to the site

boulevard in the heart of the historic Alta Vista Tract. The stretch
of <font color="#a9a9a9">Huntington Boulevard </font>between First
Street on the west side and Cedar Avenue on the east side has many
large, stately homes. Original development of the area began around
1910 on 190 acres of what had been alfalfa fields. The Alta Vista
Tract was surveyed by <font color="#dcdcdc">William Stranahan </font>for
the<font color="#2f4f4f"> Pacific Improvement Corporation and
</font>officially platted in 1911. The tract boundaries were Balch
Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line
of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of
Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The area
was annexed into the city in January 1912 in an election that was the
first in which women voted in the community. When the Alta Vista
Tract was annexed into the city, it was uninhabited but landscaped,
although trees had to be watered by tanker truck. In 1914, developers
Billings &amp; Meyering acquired the tract, completed the street
construction, made the last necessary municipal improvements,
including water, and began marketing the area with a frenzy. Just
half a decade later, the area had <font color="#6b8e23">267

Housing Authority </font><font color="#a9a9a9">in the 1960s and
1990s</font>. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has
also built small single-family homes in the area for low-income
working families to purchase. There have been several attempts to
revitalise the suburb, including the construction of a modern
shopping centre at the corner of <font color="#2f4f4f">Fresno and B
Streets</font>, a failed attempt to build luxury apartments and a
golf course on the western edge of the suburb, and some new Section 8
apartments built along <font color="#556b2f">Church Avenue </font>on

and Foster Farms </font>both have large processing plants in the
suburb, and the <font color="#a0522d">odour </font>from these (and
other small industrial plants) has long been a problem for residents.
Fresno Chandler Executive Airport is also located on the <font color="#8b0000">West
Side</font>. Because of its location on the edge of town and years of
neglect by developers, it is not a true &quot;downtown&quot; area,
and the neighborhood is full of vacant lots, strawberry fields and
vineyards. There is <font color="#483d8b">very little </font>retail
in the area except for the area near Fresno Street and the State
Route 99 Freeway (Kearney Palm Shopping Center, built in <font color="#3cb371">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Woodward Park, in the north-east of
Fresno, was founded by the late <font color="#a9a9a9">Ralph Woodward</font>,
a long-time resident of Fresno. He bequeathed <font color="#dcdcdc">much
of his estate </font>in 1968 to establish a regional park and bird
sanctuary in northeast Fresno<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font> The park
is located on the south bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway
41 and Friant Road. With an original <font color="#556b2f">235 acres
</font>(0.95 km2) and additional acres subsequently acquired by the
City, the park now encompasses <font color="#6b8e23">300 </font><font color="#a0522d">acres
</font>(1.2 km2). Woodward Park is now full of amenities and is the
only regional park of its size in the Central Valley. The southeast
corner of the park is home to numerous bird species, providing
birders with excellent viewing opportunities. The park features a
multi-purpose amphitheater that can seat up to <font color="#228b22">2,500
people</font>, an authentic Japanese garden, a fenced dog park, a
three-mile equestrian trail, a fitness trail, three children's
playgrounds, a lake, three small ponds, seven picnic areas and eight
kilometers (5 miles) of multi-use trails that are part of the San
Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the
Lewis S. Eaton Trail system will cover 35 miles between Highway 99
and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make it a great
picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life. The park's
amphitheatre was renovated in 2010 and has hosted performances by the
likes of Deftones, Tech N9ne and Sevendust. The park is open <font color="#483d8b">from
April to October </font><font color="#3cb371">from 6am to 10pm and
from November to March from 6am to 7pm</font>. Woodward Park hosts
the annual CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) State Cross
Country Championships in late November. The park also hosts the
Woodward Shakespeare Festival, which began performances at the park
in 2005.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 5</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In unconnected mode, <font color="#a9a9a9">each
packet contains </font><font color="#dcdcdc">full address
information</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Packets are routed </font><font color="#556b2f">one
by one</font><font color="#6b8e23">, sometimes resulting in different
routing paths and </font><font color="#a0522d">disorderly delivery</font><font color="#228b22">.
</font><font color="#191970">Each packet is tagged with the
</font><font color="#483d8b">destination address, source address and
port numbers</font><font color="#8b0000">. </font>The <font color="#8b0000">packet
</font><font color="#bc8f8f">may also have a packet sequence number.
</font>This way, <font color="#663399">the packet </font>does not
need a separate path to <font color="#663399">help it find its
destination, but the </font>packet header requires much more
information, so it is larger, and this information must be searched
for in the power-hungry content memory. <font color="#008080">Each
packet is sent and </font><font color="#bdb76b">may take different
paths</font><font color="#008080">; </font>possibly the system has to
do as much work for each packet as a connection-oriented system has
to do to establish a connection, but has less information about the
application's requirements. <font color="#d2691e">At the destination,
the </font><font color="#9acd32">original message/data </font><font color="#cd5c5c">is
reassembled </font><font color="#9acd32">into the correct order </font><font color="#00008b">based
on the sequence number of the packet</font><font color="#d2691e">.
</font>Thus, a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or

using a transport layer protocol, even though intermediate nodes in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Both X.25 and Frame Relay <font color="#a9a9a9">offer
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">connection-oriented functions</font><font color="#2f4f4f">.
However, X.25 does so at the network layer of the OSI model. Frame
Relay does it at layer two, the </font><font color="#556b2f">data
link layer</font>. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame
Relay is that X.25 requires <font color="#6b8e23">a handshake between
the communicating parties </font><font color="#a0522d">before sending
</font><font color="#228b22">user packets</font>. Frame Relay does
not specify such handshakes. X.25 does not specify any functions
within the packet network. It operates only at the user network
interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any
procedure it wishes within the network. X.25 defines some limited
retransmission procedures in the UNI, and its link layer protocol
(LAPB) provides <font color="#191970">standard HDLC-type link
management procedures.</font> Frame Relay is a modified version of
the ISDN second layer protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its <font color="#8b0000">integrity
features apply only to the operations between nodes in the link, not
to end-to-end </font>operations. All retransmissions must be
performed using upper layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part
of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the <font color="#483d8b">three
</font>lower <font color="#483d8b">layers of the OSI model. </font>It
<font color="#3cb371">was widely used in </font><font color="#bc8f8f">UNI
</font><font color="#3cb371">packet switching networks in the 1980s
and early 1990s </font>to provide <font color="#663399">a
standardised interface </font>to and from packet networks. In some
implementations, X.25 was also used within the network, but its
connection-oriented characteristics made this configuration
cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay works mainly at the second
layer of the OSI model. However, its address field (Data Link
Connection ID or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer if a
minimum number of procedures are used. This frees it from many of the
burdens of the third layer of X.25, but the DLCI is still used as an
identifier in addition to the second layer link protocol between
nodes. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more
efficient than X.25. Because Frame Relay is a data link layer
protocol, it, like X.25, does not specify intra-network routing
operations. X.25's packet identifiers - virtual circuit and virtual
channel numbers - must be mapped to network addresses. The same is
true in Frame Relay for DLCI. How this is done depends on the network
provider. Since Frame Relay has no network layer procedures, it is
connection-oriented at the second layer level <font color="#008080">using
the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM) method.</font>
X.25 connections are usually established for each data transfer
session, but have a feature that allows a limited amount of traffic
to be transferred over UNI without connection-oriented handshaking.
<font color="#bdb76b">Frame Relay was used for some time to connect

Inc. </font>is an independent non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation
operated by Michigan Public Universities, <font color="#dcdcdc">founded
in 1966 </font>as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad

a means to promote education and economic development in the state</font>.
With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National
Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first
demonstrated in December 1971, when an <font color="#191970">interactive
host computer link was established between </font><font color="#8b0000">the
</font><font color="#191970">IBM mainframe systems of </font><font color="#8b0000">the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne </font><font color="#483d8b">State
University in Detroit. </font>In October 1972, connections <font color="#bc8f8f">to
the CDC mainframe at </font><font color="#663399">Michigan State
University in East Lansing </font>completed the trio. Over the next
few years, <font color="#008080">the network was extended </font>beyond
interactive host-to-host connections to <font color="#bdb76b">support
terminal-to-terminal connections</font>, host-to-host batch
connections (remote job submission, remote printing, file transfer),
interactive file transfer, gateways to the public Tymnet and Telenet
networks, host-to-host X.25interfaces, gateways to X.25 networks,
<font color="#4682b4">Ethernet-connected hosts, and eventually
</font><font color="#d2691e">TCP/IP</font><font color="#4682b4">, and
</font><font color="#9acd32">Michigan's public universities </font><font color="#4682b4">joined
the networks</font>. All this paved the way for Merit's role in <font color="#cd5c5c">the
NSFNET project from the </font>mid-1980s onwards.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The dominant explanation for the
Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to
the bacterium<font color="#a9a9a9"> Yersinia pestis</font>, which was
also responsible for the epidemic that started in southern China in
<font color="#dcdcdc">1865 </font>and eventually spread to India. The
19th century plague pathogen was first investigated by teams of
scientists visiting <font color="#2f4f4f">Hong Kong </font><font color="#556b2f">in
</font><font color="#6b8e23">1894</font>, including <font color="#a0522d">the
Franco-Swiss </font><font color="#228b22">bacteriologist </font><font color="#191970">Alexandre
Yersin</font>, who named the pathogen Yersinia pestis. In 1898,
<font color="#3cb371">Paul-Louis Simond </font>elucidated <font color="#483d8b">the
mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted</font>, and
found it to be associated with the bites of fleas whose guts had
become clogged by multiplying Y. pestis several days after they had
eaten an infected host. The blockage leads to starvation and
aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt
to remove the blockage by burping, resulting in thousands of plague
bacteria being flushed into the feeding site and infecting the host.
The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on <font color="#bc8f8f">two
rodent populations</font>: one was resistant to the disease, acting
as a host to keep the disease endemic, and the other was resistant.
When one population dies, the fleas are transmitted to other hosts,
including humans, causing a miraculous epidemic.</p>

there is insufficient evidence in the archaeological record of the

pestis was spread by rat fleas; he argues that infection must have
been human-to-human. However, no single alternative solution has
gained widespread acceptance. Many researchers who argue that Y.
pestis was the main cause of the pandemic suggest that its extent and
symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague and
other diseases such as <font color="#483d8b">typhoid, smallpox and
respiratory infections. </font>In addition to bubonic plague, others
point to septicaemic <font color="#3cb371">(</font><font color="#bc8f8f">a

that invades the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of plague,
which prolong the duration of outbreaks in all seasons and contribute
to the high mortality rate and additional symptoms recorded. In 2014,
researchers from Public Health England reported the results of <font color="#663399">25

At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen died, and a

Interestingly, although contemporary reports suggest that mass graves
were created to cope with the high death toll, recent scientific

Before 1350, Germany had about 170 000 inhabitants, a number which
had fallen by almost 40 000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so

origin, about a third of Europe's population had already died. In

<font color="#a9a9a9">igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic</font>.
The <font color="#dcdcdc">rock cycle is an </font>important

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The word pharmacy is derived <font color="#a9a9a9">from
the root word </font><font color="#dcdcdc">pharma</font>, which was
used in the 1400s and 1700s. However, the original Greek roots
pharmakos mean <font color="#556b2f">witchcraft </font><font color="#6b8e23">or
even poison.</font> In addition to its pharmaceutical functions, the
pharmacy provided general medical advice and a range of services that
today are performed exclusively by other specialists, such as surgery
and midwifery. Pharma (as it was called) often operated through a
retail shop, which <font color="#a0522d">sold </font><font color="#191970">tobacco
and patent medicines in </font><font color="#a0522d">addition to
</font><font color="#228b22">pharmaceutical </font><font color="#a0522d">ingredients.
</font>Often this place was called an apothecary, and in several
languages this is the prevailing term, although their practices more
closely resemble the modern apothecary, in English the term
apothecary would now be considered <font color="#8b0000">obsolete </font><font color="#483d8b">or
only appropriate if a wide range of herbal medicines were available.

East, advances in </font><font color="#dcdcdc">botany and chemistry
</font>led to medieval Islamic medicine making significant advances
in pharmacology<font color="#a9a9a9">. For example, </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Muhammad
ibn Zakarīya Rāzi </font>(Rhazes) (865-915) promoted the medical
use of chemical compounds. <font color="#556b2f">Abu al-Qasim
al-Zahrawi </font>(Abulcasis) (936-1013) pioneered the manufacture of
medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of
particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and
explains how to prepare the 'simple medicines' that were used to make
the complex medicines that were commonly used at the time. Sabur Ibn
Sahl (d. 869), however, was the first physician to begin a
pharmacopoeia, in which he described a wide range of medicines and
remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973-1050) wrote one of the most
valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, the Kitab al-Saydalah (Book
of Medicine), in which he explained in detail the properties of
medicines and outlined the role of pharmacists and the duties and
responsibilities of the pharmacist. Avicenna also described as many
as 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action and
indications. In fact, he devoted an entire volume to simple medicines
in The Canon of Medicine. The works of al-Maridin and Ibn al-Wafid
(1008-1074), who lived in Baghdad and Cairo, were also highly
influential, both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty
times: the younger Mesue's De Medicinis universalibus et
particularibus and the younger Abenguefit's Medicamentis simplicibus.
Peter of Abano (1250-1316) translated and completed al-Maridin's work
under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq's contribution in this field
is also pioneering. He lived in the 10th century and wrote The
foundations of the true properties of Remedies, in which, among other
things, he describes arsenic oxide and introduces silicic acid. He
made a clear distinction between <font color="#a0522d">sodium
carbonate and potassium carbonate </font>and drew attention to the
toxicity of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and lead
compounds. He also describes the distillation of seawater for
drinking water.</p>

</font>can act unjustly. When government knocks on the door, it is
the <font color="#191970">individual </font>in the form of the
postman or tax collector whose hand hits the tree. Prior to Thoreau's
<font color="#483d8b">imprisonment</font>, when a bewildered tax
collector had wondered aloud how his <font color="#3cb371">refusal to
pay </font>should be handled, <font color="#bc8f8f">Thoreau </font>had
advised: <font color="#663399">&quot;</font><font color="#008080">Divorce</font><font color="#663399">&quot;.
</font>If one chose to be the perpetrator of injustice, <font color="#bdb76b">Thoreau
</font>insisted, one had to face the fact that one made a choice. But
if government is the &quot;voice of the people&quot;, as it is often
called, shouldn't that voice be listened to? Thoreau admits that
government can express the <font color="#4682b4">will of the
majority</font>, but it can also express <font color="#d2691e">the
will </font>only <font color="#9acd32">of elite politicians.</font>
Even a good form of government &quot;may be abused and distorted
before the people can act through it&quot;. Moreover, even if
government expresses the voice of the people, this fact would not
compel obedience from <font color="#cd5c5c">individuals who </font>disagree
with what is being said. <font color="#00008b">A majority </font><font color="#32cd32">may
be powerful, but it is </font><font color="#daa520">not necessarily
right</font>. What then is the proper relationship between the
individual and the government?</p>

at least be </font><font color="#2f4f4f">publicly reported in order

However, Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey

may ask why disobedience should be public civil disobedience rather
than a <font color="#a0522d">covert </font>violation<font color="#228b22">

overcome legal obstacles to protecting his natural rights, he may
find that <font color="#191970">assisting in </font><font color="#8b0000">the
falsification of evidence or perjury </font>is more effective than
open disobedience. This assumes that public morality does not
prohibit deception in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury

same decisions and principles that </font><font color="#dcdcdc">apply
in other </font><font color="#556b2f">criminal investigations </font>and
arrests also apply in civil disobedience cases. For example, the
suspect must decide <font color="#191970">whether or not to consent

of </font><font color="#8b0000">his property </font><font color="#191970">and

to </font><font color="#483d8b">talk to </font><font color="#3cb371">the

</font><font color="#008080">to talk to investigators</font>.
However, some civil disobedients have found it difficult to <font color="#4682b4">resist
</font><font color="#d2691e">answering investigators' questions</font>,
<font color="#9acd32">sometimes because they do </font><font color="#cd5c5c">not

collector, is just the man with whom I must deal - for after all, I
quarrel with men and not with parchment - and he has voluntarily
chosen to be an agent of the government. How can he ever know well
what he is and does as a government official or as a man before he is
forced to consider whether he treats me, his neighbor whom he
respects, as a neighborly and benevolent man or as a maniac and
disturber of the peace, and see if he can overcome this obstacle to
his neighborliness without his action being met by a more impertinent
and impassioned thought or speech.&quot;</p>

offences, </font>it is important to decide <font color="#dcdcdc">whether
or not to plead guilty</font><font color="#2f4f4f">. There is </font>much
debate on <font color="#2f4f4f">this issue</font>, with some
believing that civil disobedience must be <font color="#6b8e23">subject
to the punishment</font><font color="#a0522d"> imposed by the law,
while </font>others believe that defending oneself in court <font color="#228b22">increases
the possibility of changing an unjust law.</font> It has also been
argued that both options are compatible with the spirit of civil
disobedience. The ACT-UP Civil Disobedience Training Manual states
that a civil disobedient who pleads <font color="#191970">guilty </font>is
essentially saying, &quot;Yes, I did the act I am accused of. I do
not deny it; in fact, I am <font color="#8b0000">proud of </font>it.
<font color="#483d8b">I feel I did the right thing in breaking this
particular law</font>; I am guilty as charged,&quot; but the plea of
not <font color="#3cb371">guilty</font> is a message. I feel I have
done nothing wrong. <font color="#663399">I </font><font color="#bc8f8f">may
have </font><font color="#663399">broken some specific laws, but I </font><font color="#008080">am
not guilty of doing anything </font><font color="#bdb76b">wrong</font>.
Therefore, I confess <font color="#4682b4">my innocence. &quot;</font>Pleading
<font color="#d2691e">innocent </font>is sometimes seen as a
compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally
opposing nuclear power, when asked to plead, stated that &quot;I
plead for the beauty around us&quot;; this is called a &quot;<font color="#9acd32">creative
plea</font>&quot; and is usually interpreted as a plea of not guilty.</p>

beliefs in court. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have
severely limited the availability of political necessity defense.

be assembled <font color="#556b2f">to design </font><font color="#6b8e23">physical

The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually
prepared by a design team that includes an architect, civil
engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural
engineers, fire protection engineers, design consultants,
architectural consultants and archaeological consultants. The design
team is usually employed by (i.e. contracted to) the <font color="#228b22">property
owner</font>. Under this system, once the design team has completed
the design, several construction firms or construction management
companies may be invited to bid for the design, based either directly
on the design or on drawings and <font color="#8b0000">quantity
surveying </font>prepared by <font color="#8b0000">a quantity

from the government, they can be <font color="#2f4f4f">subsidised or

an unsubsidised independent school. This definition only takes into

the power to regulate <font color="#556b2f">schools</font>, as
education is included in the list of coextensive legislative branches

<font color="#6b8e23">has been declining </font>since the mid-1970s,
as many private schools have become state schools, mostly <font color="#a0522d">due
to financial difficulties resulting from changes in pupil numbers
and/or the economy</font>. The state-integrated schools retain the
specific character of a private school and receive state funds in
return for having to operate as a state school, i.e. they must teach
the state curriculum, employ registered teachers and cannot charge
tuition fees (they can continue to charge &quot;participation fees&quot;
for the maintenance of private school land and buildings). The main
decline in the number of private schools occurred between 1979 and
1984, when the country's then <font color="#228b22">Catholic </font>private
school system was merged. As a result, New Zealand's private schools
are now largely confined to the major cities (<font color="#191970">Auckland</font>,

preferred to be called independent schools because they can operate
freely outside state and local control. Some of these schools are
also known as public schools. In the UK, preparatory schools prepare
<font color="#a9a9a9">pupils up to the age of 13 for </font><font color="#2f4f4f">public
</font>schools. The name 'public school' is based on the fact that
schools were open to pupils from anywhere, not just from a particular
locality, and that pupils could be of any religion or profession.

Agassiz's </font>lectures on natural history became popular <font color="#dcdcdc">both
in New York and on the Harvard College campus</font>. Agassiz's
approach was <font color="#2f4f4f">clearly idealistic</font>,
suggesting that Americans should &quot;participate in divine nature&quot;
and have the possibility of understanding &quot;intelligent
existences&quot;. Agassiz's approach to science combined <font color="#556b2f">observation
and </font><font color="#6b8e23">intuition </font>with the assumption
<font color="#a0522d">that man could grasp the &quot;divine design&quot;
in all phenomena</font>. In explaining life forms, Agassiz relied for
his evidence on <font color="#228b22">form questions based on a
hypothetical archetype. </font>This twofold view of knowledge was in
harmony with the common sense realism of the Scottish philosophers
<font color="#191970">Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, </font>whose
works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity
of Agassiz's efforts to 'fly with Plato' was probably also due to
other writings that Harvard students became familiar with, such as
the Platonic treatises of Ralph Cudworth, John Norris and, in a
romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge. Harvard library records reveal that
the writings of Plato and his early modernist and Romantic successors
were read almost as regularly in the 19th century as those of the
more empirical and deistic Scottish school of 'official philosophy'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The rivalry between Harvard and Yale
is fierce in every sport they meet, culminating in a football match
every autumn, which began in <font color="#a9a9a9">1875 </font>and is
usually referred to simply as &quot;The Game&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>While Harvard's football team is no longer among the best in
the country, as it often was a century ago in the early days of
football (it won the <font color="#dcdcdc">Rose Bowl </font>in 1920),
both Harvard and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In
1903, <font color="#556b2f">Harvard Stadium </font>ushered in a new
era in football, as the <font color="#6b8e23">first permanent
reinforced concrete stadium in the country</font>. In fact, the
stadium's design played a role in the development of college
football. Walter Camp (<font color="#a0522d">former captain of the
</font><font color="#191970">Yale </font><font color="#a0522d">football
team) </font>proposed widening the field to open up the game, in
order to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries.
However, the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing
surface. So other measures had to be taken. Camp instead backed
revolutionary new rules for the <font color="#8b0000">1906 </font>season.
These included the legalisation of the <font color="#483d8b">forward
pass</font>, perhaps the most significant rule change in the history
of the sport.</p>

damage from hurricanes than most other East Coast cities, although
there is a direct threat of a major hurricane. The city has received
only one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871, but Jacksonville has
experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen
times as storms have passed through the state from the Gulf of Mexico
to the Atlantic Ocean or from the north or south of the Atlantic and
passed over the region. The strongest impact on Jacksonville was
<font color="#a9a9a9">Hurricane Dora in </font>1964, the only storm
on record to hit the first coast with hurricane force winds. The
storm crossed St. Augustine with winds that had barely subsided <font color="#dcdcdc">to

the </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Saffir-Simpson </font><font color="#556b2f">scale</font>.
Jacksonville also suffered damage from Tropical Storm <font color="#a0522d">Fay
in </font>2008, which passed through the state and blacked out parts
of Jacksonville for four days. Similarly, four years earlier,
Jacksonville was hit by flooding from Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne,
which made landfall south of the region. These tropical cyclones were
the costliest indirect hits on Jacksonville. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd
caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the
<font color="#228b22">Jacksonville Beach pier </font>was severely
damaged and later demolished. Fay later damaged the rebuilt pier, but
did not destroy it. Tropical Storm Bonnie caused minor damage in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to a study by the World
Institute for Development Economics Research at the United Nations
University, the richest one per cent of adults owned <font color="#dcdcdc">40

<font color="#2f4f4f">people in </font>the world <font color="#2f4f4f">hold

</font><font color="#228b22">$41 trillion in </font><font color="#6b8e23">2008.
A </font>report published by Oxfam in January 2014 claims that the
combined wealth of the world's 85 richest people is equal to <font color="#191970">50%
of </font>the world's population, or <font color="#8b0000">around </font><font color="#483d8b">3.5
billion </font><font color="#8b0000">people.</font> According to an
analysis of the report by the Los Angeles Times, the richest 1% own
46% of the world's wealth. The 85 richest people, a small fraction of
the richest 1%, own about 0.7% of humanity's wealth, the same amount
as the wealth of the bottom half of the population. More recently, in
January 2015, Oxfam reported that the richest 1% <font color="#3cb371">will
own </font><font color="#bc8f8f">more than </font><font color="#663399">half
of </font><font color="#3cb371">the world'</font>s<font color="#3cb371">
wealth by 2016.</font> A study by Credit Suisse in October 2014 also
claims that the top 1% now own almost half of the world's wealth and
that rising inequality could trigger a recession. In October 2015,
Credit Suisse published a study which found that global inequality
continues to rise and that half of the world's wealth is now held by
the top 1 percent, each with assets of more than <font color="#008080">$759,900.</font>
A report published by Oxfam in 2016 claimed that the 62 richest
individuals own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's
population combined. However, Oxfam's claims have been challenged by
<font color="#4682b4">the </font><font color="#d2691e">methodology
</font><font color="#9acd32">used</font>: using net wealth (adding up

[unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, lead author of the Credit
Suisse report, one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Trade liberalisation can shift
economic inequalities from a <font color="#a9a9a9">global </font>to a
domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the
<font color="#dcdcdc">wages of </font>low-skilled workers in rich

Krugman argues that <font color="#228b22">trade liberalisation has
had a </font>measurable impact on rising inequality in the US. He
says this trend is due to increased trade with poorer countries and
the fragmentation of productive assets, which leads to more fungible
low-skilled jobs. However, he acknowledges that the impact of trade
on inequality in the US is <font color="#191970">small </font>compared
to other causes, such as <font color="#8b0000">technological
innovation, and </font>this is the view of other experts. Empirical
economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the
data that international trade increases income inequality. They
empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem
on the effects of international trade on income distribution.
Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has accounted for only 5-15% of
the increase in income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that
<font color="#483d8b">technological innovation </font>and automation
have meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced <font color="#3cb371">by
machine labour </font>in wealthier countries and that there are no

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In plotting the relationship between
income levels and inequality, <font color="#a9a9a9">Kuznets </font>saw
that the level of inequality in middle-income developing countries
was inflating to form what is now known as <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Kuznets curve</font>. Kuznets showed this relationship using
cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of the theory with
better panel data has shown it to be <font color="#2f4f4f">very weak</font>.
The Kuznets curve predicts that income inequality <font color="#6b8e23">will
decrease </font><font color="#556b2f">over </font>time. As an
example, income inequality did indeed fall in the United States
during its high school movement from <font color="#a0522d">1910 to
1940 </font>and beyond. However, recent data show that the level of
income inequality started to rise after the <font color="#228b22">1970s</font>.
This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory, but it may be
possible that another Kuznets cycle is underway, specifically the
shift from manufacturing to the service sector, which means that it
may be possible for several Kuznets cycles to be <font color="#bc8f8f">in

income, and consumption inequality in the US is less extreme than
income inequality. Will Wilkinson <font color="#dcdcdc">of the

evidence suggests that the growth in consumption inequality has been
much less dramatic than the growth in income inequality&quot; and
that consumption is more important than income. According to Johnson,
Smeeding and Tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in <font color="#2f4f4f">2001
</font>than in 1986. The debate is summarised in the book &quot;The
Hidden Prosperity of the Poor&quot; by <font color="#556b2f">journalist

have found consumption inequality to be no less dramatic than
household income inequality, and a CBO study found that consumption

the more waste and pollution <font color="#a9a9a9">is generated</font>,
which in many cases leads to environmental degradation. This can be
explained by the fact that as the poorer people in society become
wealthier, their annual carbon dioxide emissions increase. This
relationship is illustrated by the Environmental Kuznets Curve
(EKC).[not cited] However, it should be noted that in certain cases
where economic inequality is high, waste and pollution are not
generated more because waste/pollutants are better cleaned afterwards
(water treatment, filtration, etc...)..... Note also that the overall
increase in <font color="#dcdcdc">pollution </font>is the result of
multiplying the increase in <font color="#2f4f4f">emissions per

that some modern economic inequalities are the result of the <font color="#556b2f">violent

improves society as a whole</font>, including its poorest members.
Rawls does not address all the implications of his theory of justice.
Some see Rawls's argument as a justification for capitalism because,
in theory, the poorest members of society also benefit from the
innovations that capitalism increases; others believe that only a
strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls's theory of justice.</p>

the </font>University of Chicago, fearing that its vast resources
would harm smaller schools by drawing away good students, joined

University and Stetson University</font>. In <font color="#556b2f">1896,

Mount Carroll</font>, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation,
the schools were required to have courses of study equivalent to
those of the University, to notify the University early of any
proposed faculty appointments or dismissals, not to appoint faculty
without University approval, and to send copies of examinations for
proposals. The University of Chicago agreed to award a diploma to any
graduate of the combined school who <font color="#a0522d">received an
A grade in all four years </font><font color="#228b22">and to any
other graduate who completed 12 weeks of additional study at the
University of Chicago.</font> A student or faculty member of the
merged school was entitled to free tuition at the University of
Chicago, and Chicago students were entitled to study at the merged
school under the same conditions and receive credit for their
coursework. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide <font color="#191970">the
affiliated schools with </font>books and scientific equipment and
supplies at cost, special teachers and lecturers at no cost except
travel expenses, and one copy of each book and journal published by
the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided
that either party may terminate the affiliation agreement by giving
appropriate notice. <font color="#8b0000">Several professors at the

meant additional work for them without compensation and because they

UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational
comedy, as the Compass Players student comedy group evolved into The
Second City improvisational theatre company in 1959. The Reva and
David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October <font color="#483d8b">2012</font>,
five years after alumni David Logan and his wife Reva donated $35
million. The centre has spaces for exhibitions, performances, courses
and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams
and Billie Tsien. This building is actually all glass. The brick is
the facade, designed to protect the glass from the wind. The
architects later removed parts of the brick after complaints that
views of the city were blocked.</p>

ruling dynasty of China founded by <font color="#556b2f">Kublai Khan</font>,
leader of the Mongol Borjigin clan. Although the Mongols had ruled
territories including present-day northern China for decades, <font color="#a0522d">Kublai
Khan did </font>not formally declare the dynasty in traditional
Chinese style until <font color="#6b8e23">1271.</font> His kingdom
was by then isolated from the other Khanates and ruled over most of
modern China and surrounding areas, including present-day Mongolia
and Korea. It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and
lasted until 1368, after which its Genghis dynasty rulers returned to
their Mongol homeland and continued to rule the northern Yuan
Dynasty. Some of the Mongol emperors of the Yuan mastered Chinese,
while others used only their native language (i.e. Mongolian) and the
Phags-pa script.</p>

the successor to the <font color="#a9a9a9">Mongol Empire </font>and
the imperial dynasty of China. It was a Khanate ruled by the
successors of the Möngke Khan after the split of the Mongol Empire.
In official Chinese historiography, the Yuan Dynasty carried the
Mandate of Heaven, which succeeded <font color="#2f4f4f">the Song
Dynasty </font>and preceded <font color="#6b8e23">the Ming Dynasty.
The </font>dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, but he placed his

Khan as the </font>official founder of the dynasty under the name
Taizu.[b] In the Declaration of the Dynasty's Name (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">《建國號詔》</font>),
Kublai proclaimed the new dynasty's name as the Great Yuan and
claimed the succession of the former Chinese dynasties from the Three
Rulers and Five Emperors to the Tang Dynasty.</p>

</font>Kublai Khan adopted the name Great Yuan (Chinese: <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">大元</font>;
pinyin: Dà Yuán; Wade-Giles: Ta-Yüan) and founded the Yuan
Dynasty<font color="#a9a9a9">. </font>&quot;Dà Yuán&quot; (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">大元</font>)
is from the phrase &quot;<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">大哉乾元</font>&quot;
(dà zai Qián Yuán / &quot;Great is Qián, primitive&quot;) in the
commentary section on Qián (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">乾</font>)

The Mongolian equivalent was <font color="#6b8e23">Dai Ön Ulus, </font><font color="#a0522d">also
rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus. </font>In Mongolian,
Dai Ön (Great Yuan) is often used in conjunction with &quot;Yeke

State</font>&quot;), resulting in Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus
(Mongolian spelling: ), meaning &quot;Great Yuan <font color="#191970">Great

&quot;Mongol Dynasty&quot; or &quot;Chinese Mongol Dynasty&quot;,
similar to the Qing Dynasty's designations of &quot;Manchu Dynasty&quot;
or &quot;Chinese Manchu Dynasty&quot;. In addition, Yuan is sometimes
known as the 'Great Khanate' or 'Great Khanate', which appeared
especially on some Yuan maps because Yuan emperors nominally held the
title of <font color="#8b0000">Great Khan</font>. However, both terms
can also refer to the Khanate within the Mongol Empire, which was
ruled by the Grand Khanates immediately before the actual Yuan
Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan in 1271.</p>

Mongolia proclaimed <font color="#228b22">Ariq Böke </font>as Grand

traditional Chinese dynasty. The name of the dynasty was derived from
the I Ching and describes the &quot;origin of the universe&quot; or
&quot;primordial power&quot;. Kublai proclaimed the Khanbaliq dynasty
as the 'great capital' or Daidu (Dadu, Chinese <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">大都</font>).
The name of the era was changed to Zhiyuan to mark a new era in
Chinese history. The introduction of the dynastic name legitimised
the Mongol regime by integrating the government into the traditional
Chinese narrative of political tradition. Khublai created a public

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Kublai government ran into
financial difficulties <font color="#a9a9a9">after </font><font color="#dcdcdc">1279</font>.
Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongolian coffers.
Corruption and political scandals hampered efforts to raise tax
revenue. Economic problems were compounded by poorly managed military
campaigns. Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed due to <font color="#556b2f">an
unfavourable typhoon.</font> Kublai failed in his campaigns against
Annam, Champa and Java, but achieved a Pyrrhic victory over Burma.
The expeditions were hampered by disease, an unfavourable climate and
tropical terrain unsuitable for Mongol mounted warfare. The Tran <font color="#a0522d">(Dai
Viet) </font>dynasty, which ruled <font color="#6b8e23">Annam,
</font>crushed and defeated the Mongols <font color="#191970">at the
Battle of Bạch Đằng </font>(<font color="#8b0000">1288)</font>.
The Chinese territory of Fujian was the original homeland of the
Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under the leadership of
Trần Kinh (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">陳京</font>, Chén Jīng)
to Dai Viet and whose descendants founded the Trần dynasty Đại
Việt, which ruled Vietnam, and certain members of the clan could
still speak Chinese, as for example when a Yuan dynasty envoy met the
Chinese-speaking Trần prince Trần Quốc Tuấn (later King Trần
Hưng Đạo) in 1282. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from
Song dynasty China, such as Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao, fled to Tran
dynasty-ruled Vietnam after the Song Mongol invasion and helped Tran
fight the Mongol invasion. The Tran dynasty hailed from the Fujian
region of China, as did Daoist priest Xu Zongdao, who recorded the
Mongol invasion and referred to them as the &quot;bandits of the
north&quot;. Annam, Burma and Champa recognised Mongol hegemony and
established tributary relations with the Yuan Dynasty.</p>

the </font>former rulers of the Duan Dynasty were appointed

to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather.
He also made peace with the western Mongol Khanates and neighbouring

taxes for a few decades. However, the corruption of the Yuan Dynasty

</font>in 1328, the Qipchaq commander El Temür invited Tugh Temür
back to Khanbaliq. He was installed as emperor (Emperor Wenzong) of
Khanbaliq, while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh ascended the throne in
Shanghai with the support of Yesün Temür's favourite servant Dawlat
Shah. After receiving support from the princes and officers of
northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Tugh Temür in
Khanbaliq eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh<font color="#dcdcdc">,
</font>known as the <font color="#2f4f4f">War of the Two Capitals</font>.
Tugh Temür then abdicated power in favour of his brother Kusala, who
was supported by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's
intention to welcome him. Kusala, however, died suddenly just <font color="#556b2f">four
days </font>after the banquet with <font color="#6b8e23">Tugh Temür</font>.
<font color="#a0522d">El Temür </font>allegedly killed him with
poison, and <font color="#228b22">Tugh Temür </font>subsequently
resumed his throne. Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to
Western Mongol Khanates, such as the Golden Horde and Ilkhanate, to
gain acceptance as the suzerain of the Mongol world. However, he was
mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his
three-year reign. El Temür purged the pro-Kusala officials and
handed power to the warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the
dynasty's decline.</p>

death, Bayan became as influential an official as El Temür had been
at the beginning of his long reign. As Toghun Temür grew older, he
began to resent Bayan's autocratic rule. In 1340, he allied himself
with Bayan's nephew Toqto'a, who was at odds with Bayan, and deposed
Bayan in a coup. With Bayan's dismissal, Toghtogha took over the
court. There was clearly a new, fresh spirit in his first
administration. He also gave some early signs of a new and positive
direction for the central government. One of his successful projects
was to complete the long-stagnant official histories of the <font color="#a0522d">Liao,

However, Toghtogha resigned his post with the consent of Toghun

</font><font color="#2f4f4f">1340s </font><font color="#556b2f">onwards,
</font>the rural population suffered from recurrent natural disasters
such as droughts, floods and resulting famines, and government
inefficiency led to a decline in popular support. In 1351, the <font color="#a0522d">Red

suddenly dismissed him <font color="#483d8b">for fear of betrayal</font>.
This led, on the one hand, to the restoration of Toghun Temür's
power and, on the other, to the rapid weakening of the central
government. He had no choice but to rely on the military power of the
local warlords, and gradually lost interest in politics and stopped
intervening in political struggles. In 1368, he fled from Khanbaliq
(now Beijing) north to Shangdu as the forces of the Ming Dynasty
(<font color="#3cb371">1368-1644)</font>, founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in
the south, approached. He had attempted to retake Khanbaliq, but
ultimately failed; he died at Yingchang (in present-day Inner
Mongolia) two years later (1370). The Ming conquered Yingchang
shortly after his death. Some members of the royal family still lived
in Henan today.</p>

trade and commerce throughout Asia until its demise; contacts between
the Yuan dynasty and its ally and subject, the <font color="#228b22">Ilkhanate
in </font>Persia, contributed to this development. Buddhism was a
major influence in the Yuan government, and the Tibetan rite, Tantric
Buddhism, had a significant impact on China during this period. The
Muslims of the Yuan Dynasty introduced Middle Eastern cartography,
astronomy, medicine, clothing and diet to East Asia. Oriental crops
such as <font color="#191970">carrots, turnips, new varieties of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Yuan Dynasty was the first time
that <font color="#dcdcdc">non-Indigenous Chinese </font>ruled the
whole of China. In Mongolian historiography, it is generally regarded
as <font color="#2f4f4f">the successor to the Mongol Empire</font>.
The Mongols are generally known to worship the <font color="#6b8e23">Eternal
Heaven</font>, and according to traditional Mongolian ideology, Yuan
is considered to be 'the beginning of an infinite number of beings,
the foundation of peace and happiness, the sovereignty of the state,
the dream of many peoples, beyond which there is nothing great or
precious'. In traditional Chinese historiography, on the other hand,
the Yuan dynasty is generally regarded as a legitimate dynasty
between <font color="#191970">the Song </font>and <font color="#3cb371">Ming
dynasties.</font> Note, however, that the Yuan dynasty is
traditionally often extended to include the Mongol Empire before
Kublai Khan formally established the Yuan in 1271, partly because
Kublai placed his grandfather in the official records of Genghis Khan
as the founder of the dynasty, Taizu (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">太祖
</font>in Chinese). Despite the traditional historiography as well as
official views (including the Ming dynasty government that overthrew
the Yuan dynasty), there are also Chinese people[who?] who did not
consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty in China, but
rather as <font color="#663399">a foreign power.</font> The latter
believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens and
that China stagnated economically and scientifically.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The bureaucratic system created by
Kublai Khan reflected the different cultures of the empire, including
<font color="#dcdcdc">Han Chinese, Khitan, Yurchen, Mongolian and
Tibetan Buddhist</font><font color="#2f4f4f">. </font>Although the
official terminology of the institutions might suggest that the
administrative structure was almost purely that of the <font color="#556b2f">native
Chinese dynasties</font>, the Yuan bureaucracy was in fact a mixture
of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of
the bureaucracy came mainly from the indigenous <font color="#6b8e23">Tang
and Song dynasties and the Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties</font>.
Chinese advisers such as <font color="#a0522d">Liu Bingzhong and </font><font color="#228b22">Yao
Shu </font>gave strong influence to the early Kublai court, and a
central administration was established in the first decade of Kublai
rule. The government adopted the traditional Chinese <font color="#191970">tripartite
</font>division of power between <font color="#483d8b">civil,
military and </font><font color="#3cb371">censorship authorities</font>,
with a central secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to handle civil affairs,
a secret society (Chinese: <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">樞密院</font>)
to handle military affairs and a censorship bureau to carry out
internal control and inspection. However, there was considerable
overlap in the actual functions of both central and local government
institutions between civil and military jurisdiction, due to the
Mongols' traditional reliance on military institutions and agencies
as the core of governance. However, a civil bureaucracy was created
in China, with the central secretariat as the supreme institution,
responsible (directly or indirectly) for most other government
agencies (such as the traditional Chinese system of six ministries).
Occasionally, a second central government department called the
Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) was created, which dealt
mainly with finance (for example, under Külüg Khan or Emperor
Wuzong), but this was generally abandoned soon afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the Yuan or Mongol period in
China, many important artistic disciplines such as <font color="#a9a9a9">painting,
mathematics, </font><font color="#dcdcdc">calligraphy, poetry and
theatre </font>took place or continued, and many great artists and
writers are famous today. Since <font color="#2f4f4f">painting,
poetry and calligraphy </font>were combined during this period, many
of the artists who practised these different disciplines were the
same person, although they may have been better known in some areas
than others. <font color="#a0522d">The Song Dynasty </font>and the
Yuan Dynasty are often linked in terms of the further development of
landscape painting and the classical fusion of painting, poetry and
calligraphy. There were many famous painters in Chinese painting
during the Yuan Dynasty. In calligraphy, many of the great
calligraphers were from the Yuan Dynasty. The most important
development in Yuan poetry was the <font color="#191970">Qu</font>,
which most famous Yuan poets used alongside other forms of poetry.
Many of the poets were also involved in the great development of
theatre during this period, and vice versa: important figures in
theatre became famous through the development of the sanqu-type <font color="#8b0000">qu</font>.
One of the most important factors in the mixing of <font color="#483d8b">zaju
</font>varietee was the inclusion of poetry from both the classical
and more recent qu forms. One of the important cultural developments
of the Yuan period was the fusion of poetry, painting and calligraphy
into a single work, the kind that usually comes to mind when one
thinks of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of the Yuan
period is the increasing incorporation of the vernacular Chinese
language of the time into both the qu form of poetry and zaju verse.
Another important aspect of Yuan Dynasty art and culture is that much
of it has been preserved in China, compared to the works of the Tang
and Song Dynasties, which are often better preserved in, for example,
Japanese Shōsōin.</p>

religions were practised, including <font color="#a9a9a9">Buddhism</font>,
Islam and Christianity. The establishment of the Yuan Dynasty had
dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China. However,
unlike <font color="#dcdcdc">the Western </font>Khanates, <font color="#2f4f4f">the

the founder of the Yuan Dynasty, favoured Buddhism<font color="#6b8e23">,

Buddhism </font>became established as the de facto state religion. A
top-level department and government agency called the <font color="#191970">Buddhist
and Tibetan Affairs Bureau </font>(Xuanzheng Yuan) was established in
Khanbaliq (now Beijing) to oversee Buddhist monks throughout the
empire. As Kublai Khan only valued <font color="#483d8b">the Sakya
Lakh of </font>Tibetan Buddhism, other religions were given less
importance. He and his successors kept the <font color="#3cb371">Sakya
</font>imperial preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the
Yuan Dynasty, 14 Sakya leaders had held the post of Imperial
Preceptor and thus enjoyed special power. In addition, the protection
of Mongolian Buddhism led to the creation of several monuments of
Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from
Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many members of
the Mongol upper classes, such as the Jalayir and Oronar nobles and
emperors, also patronised Confucian scholars and institutions. A
considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were
translated into Mongolian.</p>

medical techniques, such as <font color="#191970">acupuncture,
moxibustion, pulse diagnosis and various herbal medicines </font><font color="#8b0000">and
elixirs, </font>spread westwards to the Middle East and other parts
of the empire. The Yuan period saw many medical advances. The
physician Wei Yilin (1277-1347) invented a method of suspension to
reduce dislocated joints, which he performed using an anaesthetic.
The Mongol physician Hu Sihui described the importance of a healthy
diet in a medical treatise published in 1330.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Politically, the system of
government created by Kublai Khan was a compromise between Mongol

<font color="#dcdcdc">traditional Chinese </font><font color="#2f4f4f">autocratic
and bureaucratic </font><font color="#556b2f">system</font>. However,
the socially educated Chinese elite did not generally enjoy the
prestige previously accorded to it under the original Chinese
dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite did not share in
power, the Mongols and Semurans (<font color="#6b8e23">various </font><font color="#a0522d">allied
groups </font><font color="#228b22">from Central Asia </font><font color="#191970">and

mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a
<font color="#8b0000">somewhat strong '</font><font color="#483d8b">colonial</font><font color="#8b0000">'
colour</font>. The unequal treatment was possibly due to a fear of
transferring power to ethnic Chinese. Mongols and Semuren were given
certain advantages during the dynasty, and this continued even after
the restoration of imperial degrees in the early 1300s. In general,
North or South Chinese very rarely <font color="#3cb371">reached the
highest positions in government, compared to the </font>Persians who
did so during the <font color="#bc8f8f">Ilkhanate.</font> Later, the

that existed during the Yuan Dynasty. In response to a protest about
the use of 'barbarians' in his government, the Yongle Emperor
replied: &quot;... the Mongols used discrimination during the Yuan
Dynasty when they used only &quot;Mongols and Tartars&quot; and
rejected the North and South Chinese, and this was the very reason
that caused their disaster&quot;.</p>

</font>are a subset of T cells that kill <font color="#2f4f4f">cells
infected </font>or otherwise damaged or dysfunctional by <font color="#2f4f4f">viruses
</font>(and other pathogens). Like B cells, each type of T cell
recognises a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when

receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is
aided by the T cell co-receptor <font color="#228b22">CD8</font>. The
T cell then travels throughout the body looking for cells where MHC I
receptors carry this antigen. When the activated T cell contacts such
cells, it releases cytotoxins such as <font color="#191970">perforin,
</font>which form <font color="#8b0000">pores </font>in the plasma

the target cell. Killing T cells in host cells is particularly
important in preventing viral replication. T cell activation is
tightly controlled and usually requires a very strong MHC/antigen
activation signal or additional activation signals from 'helper' T
cells (see below).</p>

circumvent the adaptive immune system </font>are more complex. The
simplest is to <font color="#dcdcdc">rapidly modify the non-essential

pathogen and keep the essential epitopes hidden. This is called
<font color="#2f4f4f">antigenic variation</font>. An example is <font color="#556b2f">HIV</font>,
which mutates rapidly, so the proteins in its viral envelope, which

These <font color="#6b8e23">frequent changes in antigens </font>may
explain the failure of vaccines against this virus. <font color="#a0522d">The

This is called immune surveillance. Mutated cells in tumours express
<font color="#2f4f4f">antigens that are </font>not present in normal
cells. These antigens appear foreign to the immune system and their
presence triggers immune cells to attack the mutated tumour cells.

cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins, which

categories</font>, <font color="#a0522d">probabilistic </font><font color="#556b2f">(or
&quot;Monte Carlo&quot;) </font>and <font color="#6b8e23">deterministic
</font><font color="#a0522d">algorithms</font>. Deterministic
algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is
prime or not. For example, a trial division is a <font color="#228b22">deterministic
</font><font color="#191970">algorithm </font>because, if executed
correctly, it always identifies a prime number as prime and a
composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are generally
faster, but they do not fully prove that a number is a prime number.
These tests are based on testing a given number in a semi-random way.
For example, a particular test might pass all the time if applied to
a prime number, but only pass with probability p if applied to a
composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass it every
time, the probability that our number is a compound number is
<font color="#8b0000">1/(1-p)n</font>, which decreases exponentially
with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though
never absolutely sure) that the number is a prime number. On the
other hand, if the test never fails, we know that the number is a
composite.</p>

important that it has been generalised in different ways in different
areas of mathematics. Generally speaking, &quot;prime number&quot;
means, in an appropriate sense, <font color="#a9a9a9">minimality </font><font color="#dcdcdc">or
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">indivisibility. </font>For example, a
prime field is the <font color="#556b2f">smallest subfield of </font>a

is either <font color="#6b8e23">Q or a finite field with p elements,

meaning, namely that <font color="#a0522d">any object can in
principle be uniquely decomposed into its prime components</font>.
For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is
indivisible in the sense that <font color="#228b22">it </font><font color="#191970">cannot

3] The spelling Rh- in English Rhine and German Rhein and French <font color="#191970">Rhin
</font>is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the
pronunciation -i- is due to the Gaulish name <font color="#8b0000">*Rīnaz
being </font>adopted proto-germanically from Old Frankish (Old
English Rín, Old High German Rīn, Dutch <font color="#3cb371">Rijn
</font>(formerly also <font color="#bc8f8f">Rhijn</font>)). The
diphthong of modern German Rhine (also adopted in Romance Rhine,
Rain) is a Middle Germanic development in the early modern period,
while the Low Germanic name Rī(n) retains the older vowel form,[note
4] as does the Ripuarian Rhing, while the diphthongized Rhei, Rhoi in
Palatinate. Spanish, with French, has adopted the Germanic vowel form
Rin-, while Italian, Occitan and Portuguese retain the Latin Ren-.</p>

determined by two forks: firstly, at Millingen aan de Rijn, the Rhine
divides into the Waal and the Pannerdens Kanaal, which changes its
name <font color="#a9a9a9">to Nederrijn at Angeren, </font>and
secondly, at Arnhem, the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn. This
creates <font color="#dcdcdc">three </font>main rivers, two of which
change name quite frequently. The largest and southernmost main
branch begins as the <font color="#2f4f4f">Waal </font>and continues
as the Boven Merwede ('Upper Merwede'), Beneden Merwede ('Lower
Merwede'), Noord River ('Northern River'), Nieuwe Maas ('New Meuse'),
Het Scheur ('<font color="#556b2f">Rip</font>') and Nieuwe Waterweg
('New Waterway'). The central river starts as Nederrijn, then becomes
Lek and joins the Noord to form the Nieuwe Maas. The northern flow
keeps its name IJssel until it flows <font color="#6b8e23">into Lake
IJsselmeer. </font><font color="#a0522d">Three </font>other streams
