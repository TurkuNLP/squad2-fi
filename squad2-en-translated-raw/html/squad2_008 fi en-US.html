<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Puberty is a
</font>long process that starts with an increase in hormone
production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is
a period of life characterised by the emergence and development of
secondary sexual characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and a
larger Adam's apple in boys and the development of breasts and a more
curved and pronounced pelvis in girls) and a marked shift in hormonal
balance towards adulthood. This is triggered by the <font color="#dcdcdc">pituitary
gland, which </font>releases hormones into the bloodstream,
triggering a chain reaction. The male and female gonads are then
activated, causing them to grow and develop rapidly; the triggered
gonads begin mass production of the chemicals they now need. The
<font color="#2f4f4f">testes </font>primarily release testosterone,
while <font color="#556b2f">the ovaries </font>release mainly
oestrogen. The production of these hormones gradually increases until
maturity is reached. Some boys may develop <font color="#6b8e23">gynaecomastia
</font>due to sex hormone imbalances, tissue reactivity or obesity.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The timing of puberty can have
important psychological and social consequences. Boys who mature
<font color="#a9a9a9">early </font>tend to be taller and stronger
than their friends. They have an advantage in attracting the
attention of potential partners and in selection for sport.
Adolescent boys often have a good body image and are more confident,
self-assured and independent. Boys who mature late can be more
assertive because of <font color="#dcdcdc">poor body image </font>when
comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However,
early puberty is not always a positive thing for boys; early sexual
maturation in boys may be associated with increased aggression due to
the <font color="#2f4f4f">hormonal </font>surge that affects them.
Because adolescent boys look older than their peers, they may face
increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may
perceive them as more emotionally developed, even though their
cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance.
Studies have shown that boys who mature <font color="#556b2f">early
are </font>more likely to be sexually active and more likely to

physical growth</font>, a cognitive <font color="#dcdcdc">change in
the ability to think abstractly and multidimensionally</font>, or a

changes in brain structure and organisation. <font color="#556b2f">Cognitive
</font>advances include both increased knowledge and the ability to
think abstractly and reason more effectively. The study of adolescent
development often involves interdisciplinary collaboration. For
example, researchers in neuroscience or biobehavioural sciences may
focus on changes in brain structure during adolescence and their
impact on cognition or social relationships. Sociologists interested
in adolescence may focus on the adoption of social roles (e.g. worker
or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social
contexts. Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in
relationships with parents and peers as a result of school structure
and adolescent status.</p>

Macfarlane </font>founded the University of California, Berkeley's
Institute of Human Development, formerly known as the <font color="#dcdcdc">Institute
of Child Welfare</font>, in 1927. The Institute was instrumental in
launching research into healthy development, in contrast to earlier
work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological
personalities. The studies looked at human development during the
Great Depression and the Second World War, in the unique historical
circumstances in which a whole generation of children grew up. The
Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in
1931, was designed to study the physical, intellectual and social
development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in
1932 and continued until <font color="#6b8e23">1981</font>, allowing
the researchers to collect longitudinal data on individuals from
adolescence to adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley
Guidance Study, which examined children's development in terms of
their socio-economic and family background. These studies provided
the background for Glen Elder, who in the 1960s proposed a
life-course approach to adolescent development. Elder formulated a
number of descriptive principles about adolescent development.
According to the principle of historical time and place, an
individual's development is shaped by the period and place in which
he or she grows up. The principle of the importance of timing in an
individual's life suggests that life events have a differential
impact on development depending on when they occur in an individual's
life. According to the idea of interconnected life stages, an
individual's development is shaped by the interconnected networks of
relationships to which he or she belongs, and according to the
principle of human agency, an individual's life course is shaped by
his or her choices and actions in the context of his or her
historical period and social network.</p>

your role in the family. Young children tend to assert themselves
strongly, but are unable to exert much influence over family
decisions until <font color="#a9a9a9">early adolescence</font>, when
parents increasingly see them as equals. The role of adolescents is
to increase their independence while maintaining a caring
relationship with their parents. As children reach <font color="#dcdcdc">adolescence</font>,
conflicts between parents and children often increase significantly
and family cohesion weakens. These disputes often concern minor
issues of control, such as curfews, acceptable dress and the young
person's right to privacy, which may previously have been seen by
young people as matters under the full control of their parents.
Disagreements between parents and young people also increase as
friends show greater influence on each other, new influences on young
people that may be at odds with parental values. Social media is also
playing an increasingly important role in youth-parent disagreements.
While parents did not have to worry about the threats of social media
in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While
young people are pursuing their freedoms, for parents, not knowing
what their children are doing on social media sites is a challenging
issue because of the increasing number of predators on social media
sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking
sites, and this further increases their distrust. An important
challenge in the relationship between parents and young people is to
understand how to improve the potential of online communication while
managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents
increase during adolescence, they are relatively minor problems. On
important life issues, most young people still share <font color="#2f4f4f">the

decision-making and cognitive control, as well as other higher
cognitive functions. During adolescence, myelination and synaptic

leads to better evaluation of risks and rewards and better impulse

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Peer-to-peer communication allows
young people to explore their feelings and identity and to develop
and assess their social skills. Peer groups offer their members the
opportunity to develop social skills such as <font color="#a9a9a9">empathy,
sharing and leadership.</font> Young people choose peer groups on the
basis of similar characteristics they find in themselves. By tapping
into these relationships, young people become more accepting of who
they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into the
young person's own sense of self. By developing new communication
skills and reflecting on the skills of their peers and their own
opinions and values, young people can share and express feelings and
other concerns without fear of rejection or judgement. Peer groups
can have positive effects on individuals, such as <font color="#dcdcdc">academic
motivation and achievement</font>. While peer groups can facilitate
each other's social development, they can also hinder it. Peer groups
can have negative effects, such as encouraging peer pressure <font color="#2f4f4f">to
experiment with drugs, drinking, vandalism and stealing</font>.
Susceptibility to peer pressure increases in early adolescence, peaks
at around one year of age14 and declines thereafter. Further evidence
that peer pressure impairs social development has been found in
Spanish adolescents, where emotional (rather than solution-focused)
reactions to problems and emotional instability have been associated
with physical aggression towards peers. Both physical and
interpersonal aggression are associated with a range of persistent
psychological difficulties, particularly depression, as is social
rejection. As a result, bullied young people often develop problems
that lead to further victimisation. Bullied young people are more
likely to continue bullying and to bully others in the future.
However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying,
which is a relatively new problem among young people.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Adolescence is a time of sexual
maturation, which is also reflected in social interaction. Although
young people may engage in casual sexual encounters (often referred
to as <font color="#a9a9a9">hook-ups</font>), most sexual experiences
during this developmental stage take place in romantic relationships.
Young people may use technology and <font color="#2f4f4f">social
media </font>to seek romantic relationships because they feel it is a
safe place to experiment with dating and identity exploration. These
social media encounters can be the start of a new relationship.
Kissing, holding hands and hugging are a sign of satisfaction and
commitment. Among young adolescents, &quot;heavy&quot; sexual
activity, characterised by <font color="#556b2f">genital stimulation,
is </font>often associated with violence, depression and poor
relationship quality. This effect does not apply to sexual activity
in late adolescence in a romantic relationship. Some studies suggest
that early sexual activity is genetically linked to risk factors for
crime, suggesting that there is a group at risk for both early sexual
activity and emotional distress. However, for older adolescents,
sexual activity in the context of a romantic relationship is actually
correlated with <font color="#6b8e23">lower </font>levels of deviant
behaviour after controlling for genetic risk, in contrast to sex

abilities is related to thinking about thinking itself, called
<font color="#a9a9a9">metacognition</font>. It often involves
monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process.
As young people become more aware of their own thinking patterns,
they are better able to manage themselves and study more effectively.
It also plays a role in social cognition, leading to increased
introspection, self-awareness and intellectualisation (in the sense
of thinking one's own thoughts, rather than as a defence mechanism in
the Freudian definition). <font color="#dcdcdc">Adolescents are </font>much

motivation or confidence to leave their families. Moreover, from a
population perspective, there is the advantage that a group of
individuals who are willing to take more risks and try new methods
balances the more conservative elements that are more typical of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The development of identity is a
stage in the life cycle of a young person. For most, the search for
identity begins <font color="#a9a9a9">in </font>adolescence. During
these years, young people are more open to &quot;experimenting&quot;
with different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are.
In other words, in trying to find their identity and discover who
they are, young people are happy to rotate through several identities
to find the one that best suits them. However, developing and
maintaining an identity (during the adolescent years) is a difficult
task <font color="#dcdcdc">due to </font>many factors such as <font color="#dcdcdc">family
life, environment and social status.</font> Empirical studies suggest
that this process could be more accurately described as identity
development rather than identity formation, but it confirms a
normative process of change in both the content and structure of
ideas about the self. The two most important aspects of identity
development are <font color="#2f4f4f">self-concept and self-esteem</font>.
Because choices made during the adolescent years can affect later
life, a high sense of self and self-control in mid-adolescence leads
to better decisions in the transition to adulthood. researchers have
used three general approaches to understanding identity development:
<font color="#556b2f">self-concept, sense of identity, and
self-esteem.</font> The adolescent years create a more conscious
group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and put more
time and effort into their appearance as their bodies undergo
changes. Unlike children, teenagers strive to look presentable
(1991). The environment in which young people grow up also plays an
important role in the development of their identity. Studies by the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Self-centredness in young people is
a self-conscious desire to feel important in a peer group and to
enjoy social acceptance. In contrast to the conflicting aspects of
self-concept, identity represents a coherent self-concept that
remains stable under all circumstances, incorporating past
experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas
<font color="#a9a9a9">Erik Erikson </font>argued that not everyone
fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of developmental stages
involves an identity crisis in which young people must explore
different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves
before they commit to their beliefs. He described the resolution of
this process as a stage of &quot;identity attainment&quot;, but also
stressed that the identity challenge &quot;is never resolved
completely in one go and once and for all in one stage&quot;.
Adolescents initially define themselves in <font color="#dcdcdc">terms

&quot;discover themselves&quot;; fashion is constantly evolving,
reflecting the changing personality of teens. Young people are trying
to define their identity by consciously shaping themselves in
different ways to find what suits them best. Through trial and error,
matching both their own image and the image that others see and react
to, young people can get a sense of who they are Just as fashion
evolves to influence young people, so does the media. &quot;Modern
life takes place amidst an endless stream of flesh on screens, pages
and billboards.&quot; This flood registers consciously or
unconsciously in the mind, causing problems with self-image, which
contributes to the adolescent's sense of identity. Researcher <font color="#2f4f4f">James

research and the extent to which he or she has made commitments. As a

made without exploring alternatives, c) moratorium, or <font color="#6b8e23">exploration,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The final important part of identity
formation is self-esteem. <font color="#a9a9a9">Self-esteem </font>is
defined as thoughts and feelings about self-concept and identity.
Most theories of self-esteem recognise that all genders and age
groups have a strong desire to maintain, protect and enhance their
self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, <font color="#dcdcdc">there
is no </font>empirical evidence that self-esteem declines
significantly during adolescence. &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">Barometric
self-esteem</font>&quot; fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe
anxiety and distress, but <font color="#556b2f">baseline self-esteem
</font>remains very stable throughout adolescence. The validity of
global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many argue that
more specific scales might reveal more about young people's
experiences. Girls are more likely to enjoy high self-esteem when
they have supportive friendships, and the most important function of
friendship for them is having <font color="#6b8e23">someone who can
provide social and moral support.</font> When they fail to gain the
approval of friends or cannot find someone with whom to share common
activities and interests, girls in these cases suffer from low
self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned about establishing
and asserting their independence and defining their relationship with
authority figures. On the other hand, lack of romantic competence,
such as failure to win or maintain the affection of an opposite or
same-sex person (according to sexual orientation), is the main cause
of low self-esteem among adolescent boys. Since both men and women
happen to have low self-esteem after the end of a romantic
relationship, they are prone to other symptoms resulting from this
condition. Depression and hopelessness are just two of the different
symptoms, and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience
depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit
suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun &amp; Sartorius, 1995).</p>

puberty is the moment when most gay, lesbian and transgender young
people begin to identify and understand their feelings. Many young
people may choose to come out publicly at this stage of life, when
their identity is formed; many others may go through a phase of
questioning or denial, which may include experimentation with both
gay and heterosexual experiences. A study of 194 lesbian, gay and
bisexual young people under the age of 21 found that awareness of
sexual orientation emerged at around one year of age on average10 ,
but disclosure to peers and adults occurred at around one year of
age1617 . Accepting and creating a positive LGBT identity can be
difficult for some young people for a variety of reasons. Peer
pressure is a major factor when young people questioning their
sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers,
and this can cause great anxiety because they feel different from
others. Although coming out can also contribute to better
psychological adjustment, there are real risks involved. Coming out
in the midst of a heteronormative peer environment is often
associated with the risk of exclusion, offensive jokes and even
violence. This is why the suicide rate among LGBT youth is

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A possible major impact on
adolescence is a change in family dynamics, especially divorce.
Divorce accounts for <font color="#a9a9a9">around 50% of all
</font>divorces, so divorce is common and adds to the already large
change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after divorce often
reflect the lack of control and conflict between parents. Divorce
usually leads to <font color="#dcdcdc">a reduction in </font>contact
between the young person and the custodial parent. In extreme cases
of domestic instability and abuse, divorce can have a positive impact
on families by reducing conflict in the home. However, most studies
suggest that divorce has a negative impact on adolescence and later
development. A recent study found that, compared to their peers
growing up in stable divorced families, children who experience
divorce and experience new family changes in late adolescence make
less progress in mathematics and social studies over time. Another
recent study proposed a new theory called adolescent <font color="#2f4f4f">epistemological
trauma theory</font>, which suggests that traumatic life events, such
as parental divorce in late adolescence, predict lifelong effects on
adult conflict behaviour that can be mitigated through effective
behavioural assessment and education. Parental divorce in childhood
or adolescence continues to have negative effects in the twenties and
thirties. These <font color="#556b2f">negative </font>effects include
romantic relationships and conflict styles, which means that as
adults they are more likely to use avoidance and competitive styles
to manage conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Romantic relationships tend to
become more common throughout adolescence. By the age of 15, <font color="#dcdcdc">53%
of </font>young people have been in a romantic relationship for at
least one month in the previous 18 months. In a 2008 YouGov survey
for Channel 4, 20% of young people aged 14-17 interviewed said they
had their first sexual experience when they were 13 or younger in the
UK. A 2002 US study found that people aged 15-44 reported that the
average age of first sexual intercourse was <font color="#2f4f4f">17.0
for men </font>and <font color="#556b2f">17.3 for women. </font>The
typical duration of relationships also <font color="#6b8e23">increases
</font>during the teenage years. This steady increase in the
likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual
maturation and the development of the cognitive skills needed to
maintain a romantic attachment (e.g. caring, appropriate attachment),
although these skills do not develop strongly until late adolescence.
Through long-term relationships, young people can acquire the skills
needed to build quality relationships later in life and develop
feelings of self-esteem. Overall, positive romantic relationships
among young people can have long-term benefits. Quality romantic
relationships are associated with higher levels of engagement in
early adulthood and are positively related to self-esteem,
self-confidence and social competence. For example, young people with
positive self-esteem are more likely to consider themselves more
successful partners, while negative experiences can lead to low
self-confidence as a romantic partner. Young people often mate within
their own demographic group in terms of race, ethnicity, popularity
and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which
certain individuals, especially adolescent girls, seek to be
different. Most adolescents date around their own age, but boys tend
to date boys of the same age or younger and girls of the same age or
older.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There are certain features of
adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human
biology or cognitive structures. Culture is defined as &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">a
symbolic and behavioural heritage from the past that provides a
community framework for what is valued</font>&quot;. Culture is
learned and socially shared and affects <font color="#dcdcdc">all
</font>aspects of an individual's life. For example, social
obligations, sexual expression and the development of belief systems
are all things that are likely to vary according to culture. In
addition, youth culture is made up of characteristics that are
specific to young people, such as dress, music and other media use,
employment, art, food and drink choices, leisure and language. For
these reasons, culture is a dominant and powerful presence in young
people's lives, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's
young people without studying and understanding their culture.
However, culture should <font color="#2f4f4f">not be </font>seen as
synonymous with nation or ethnicity. There are many cultures in any
country and in any racial or socio-economic group. Moreover, to avoid
ethnocentrism, researchers must be careful <font color="#556b2f">not
to define the role of culture in youth on the basis of their own

form of communication</font>, whether it is face-to-face, email, SMS,
telephone or other means. Teenagers use many newer forms of
communication, such as text messaging and social networking sites

people are using online technologies <font color="#dcdcdc">to
experiment with emerging identities and to expand their peer groups</font>,
such as by increasing the number of friends they make on Facebook and

channels to improve their relationships with peers, but there can

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In today's society, young people
also face some risks when their sexuality starts to change. Some of
these risks, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or
exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases, including
HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily part of adolescence, but other risks,
such as teenage pregnancy (due to failure or neglect to use
contraception), are seen as a social problem in most Western
societies. <font color="#a9a9a9">One in four </font>sexually active
<font color="#a9a9a9">adolescents</font> becomes infected with an
STI. In the US, young people often choose &quot;anything but
intercourse&quot; for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe
that it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, doctors are
reporting increasing diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus
(HPV), which can cause genital warts and is now believed to affect
1%15 of the teenage population. Girls aged 15-19 have a higher
<font color="#2f4f4f">incidence of </font>gonorrhoea than any other
age group. <font color="#556b2f">A quarter of </font>all new HIV
cases are in people under 21. Multrine also notes in the article that
a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in March found that <font color="#6b8e23">81%
of </font>parents want schools to discuss condoms and contraception
with their children. They also think students should be able to be
tested for sexually transmitted infections. Teachers also want to
discuss these topics with their students. But while nine out of ten
sex education teachers across the country agree that students should
be taught about contraceptives at school, more than a quarter say
they have received explicit instructions from school boards and
administrators not to teach. According to anthropologist Margaret
Mead, the turmoil in adolescence in Western societies has a cultural
rather than physical cause; societies in which young women engaged in
free sexual activity did not experience such adolescent turmoil.</p>

This includes protecting children from unsupervised child labour,
military recruitment, prostitution and pornography. In many
societies, children who have reached a certain age (often 18, but
this varies) are considered to have reached the age of majority and
are legally regarded <font color="#2f4f4f">as adults who are

adult-like sexuality is defined by certain biological or social
milestones. For example, <font color="#a9a9a9">menarche </font>(a
woman's first menstrual period) or <font color="#dcdcdc">semenarche
</font>(a man's first ejaculation) are common defining points of
sexuality in many cultures. In addition to biological factors, the
sexual socialisation of an adolescent depends largely on whether his
or her culture is restrictive or permissive of teenage or premarital
sexual activity. <font color="#2f4f4f">Restrictive </font>cultures
openly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until
the adolescent goes through a formal rite of passage. These cultures
may attempt to restrict sexual activity by segregating men and women
throughout their development or by publicly shaming and physically
punishing them when sexual activity occurs. Less restrictive cultures
are more tolerant of expressions of adolescent sexuality or of
male-female interaction in public and private spaces. Less
restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent
sexuality and resist others. In some cultures, for example, teenage
sexual activity is acceptable, but teenage pregnancy is highly
undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity
or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In
<font color="#556b2f">permissive </font>societies, open sexual
behaviour by unmarried teenagers is considered acceptable and
sometimes even encouraged. Whether the culture is restrictive or
permissive, there are likely to be <font color="#6b8e23">differences
in </font>how women and men are expected to express their sexuality.
Cultures vary in how open these double standards are - in some it is
enshrined in law, while in others it is transmitted through social
conventions. LGBT young people face a lot of discrimination, are
bullied by people who are different from them, and may find coming
out as gay a traumatic experience. The sexual attitudes adopted by a
culture can therefore be seen to influence the beliefs, lifestyles
and social perceptions of its young people.</p>

</font>adolescere, meaning &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">growing up</font>&quot;)
is a transitional stage in a person's physical and mental
development, usually <font color="#2f4f4f">between </font>puberty and

related to teenage years, although its physical, psychological and

although puberty has historically been associated with the onset of
adolescence, it now typically begins before adolescence, and there
has been a normative shift towards starting before adolescence,

psychology began with the publication of <font color="#a9a9a9">G.
Stanley </font>Hall's &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Adolescence in
1904&quot;</font>. Hall, who was the first president of the American
Psychological Association, regarded adolescence primarily as a time
of inner turmoil and upheaval (sturm und drang). This view of
adolescence was based on two then-new ways of understanding human
behaviour: Darwin's theory of evolution and Freud's psychodynamic
theory. He believed that youth represented the phylogenetic
transition of our ancestors from primitiveness to civilisation.
Hall's arguments remained relatively unchallenged until the 1950s,
when psychologists such as Erik Erikson and Anna Freud began to
formulate their theories of adolescence. Freud believed that the
psychological disorders associated with adolescence were biologically
based and culturally universal, while Erikson focused on the
dichotomy between identity formation and role fulfilment. Despite
their different theories, the three psychologists agreed that
adolescence was an inherently disturbed and psychologically confused
time. Less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer
relationships and cultural influences, were largely ignored until the
1980s. From the 1950s to the 1980s, research in the field focused
mainly on <font color="#556b2f">describing </font>behavioural

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Young people's environment plays an
important role in the development of their identity. Although most
youth studies have been conducted <font color="#a9a9a9">on white
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">middle-class </font>children, research
shows that the more privileged their upbringing, the more successful
they are in developing their identity. An adolescent's identity
formation is a crucial time in his or her life. More recently,
demographic trends have shown that the transition to adulthood is now
taking place over a longer period of time than in the mid-20th
century. Consequently, <font color="#2f4f4f">adolescence</font>,
which encompasses late adolescence and early adulthood, has become an
increasingly important stage in the life course. This has therefore
led to various factors becoming important during this development. So
many factors contribute to an adolescent's developing social
identity, from attachment to coping skills and social media. All of
these factors are influenced by the environment in which the young
person is growing up. A child with a more privileged upbringing <font color="#556b2f">is
exposed to more opportunities and generally better situations. </font>A
young <font color="#6b8e23">person</font> from an inner-city or
crime-ridden neighbourhood is <font color="#6b8e23">more likely </font>to

development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the developmental
process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can greatly
influence future decisions. While children growing up in comfortable
suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments, they are
more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their
identity and contribute to more successful identity development.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Young people's relationships with
their peers, family and members of their social environment play a
key role in their social development. As an adolescent's social
circle develops rapidly as he or she distinguishes between friends
and acquaintances, he or she often becomes <font color="#a9a9a9">strongly
emotionally attached to friends.</font> This is not harmful, but if
these friends expose the individual to potentially harmful
situations, this is peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period
in social development because young people can easily be influenced
by people with whom they have close relationships. This is the first
time when individuals can really make their own decisions, which also
makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital to the social
development of an adolescent, as peers can have a major influence on
the individual. These relationships become important because they
begin to help the young person understand the concept of personality,
how personality is formed and why a person has a particular
personality. &quot;The use of psychological comparisons could serve
both as an index of the growth of implicit personality theory and as
a component process explaining its emergence&quot;. In other words,
by comparing the personality traits of one person with those of
another, we would create a framework for generating a general theory
of personality (and, ... such a theory would serve as a useful
framework through which we could come to understand particular
individuals).&quot; This can be compared to the use of social
comparison in the development of one's identity and self-concept,
which includes personality, and highlights the importance of
communication and thus relationships in human development. Social
comparison uses reference groups for both psychological and identity
development. These reference groups include young people's peers.
This means that who a teenager chooses or accepts as friends and with
whom he or she communicates frequently often forms his or her
reference group and can therefore have a major impact on the kind of
person he or she becomes. Research shows that <font color="#dcdcdc">relationships
</font>have the greatest impact on an individual's social

and general development. Communication with peers <font color="#a9a9a9">increases
</font>significantly during adolescence, and peer relationships
become more intense than at other stages, and have a greater impact
on the teenager, influencing both decisions and choices. High-quality
friendships can contribute to children's development, regardless of
the characteristics of the friends. When children begin to engage
with different people and form friendships, it helps them later in
adolescence and sets the stage for adolescence and peer groups. Peer
groups are particularly important during adolescence, a <font color="#dcdcdc">developmental
stage characterised by a dramatic increase in time spent with peers
and a decrease in adult supervision. </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Young
people </font>also socialise with friends of the opposite sex much
more than in childhood and tend to identify with larger peer groups

to use friends as a coping mechanism in different situations. The

learning about how young people see their own relationships and
sexuality; they want to move away from a research perspective that
focuses on problems related to young people's sexuality.&quot; (Why?)
University professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that
there were no significant gender differences in the relationship
events reported by adolescent girls and boys in grades 7-12. Most
teens reported kissing their partner, holding hands with their
partner, thinking they were a couple, and telling people they were in
a relationship. This means that both private thoughts about the
relationship and public acknowledgement of the relationship were
important for the young people in the sample. Sexual events (such as
sexual touching, intercourse) were less frequent than <font color="#a9a9a9">romantic
</font>events (holding hands) and <font color="#dcdcdc">social events
</font>(being with a partner in a group). The researchers say that
these results are important because the findings <font color="#2f4f4f">focus
on young people </font>and the <font color="#2f4f4f">more positive
aspects of their </font>social and romantic interactions, rather than
focusing on sexual behaviour and its consequences.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The extent to which young people are
perceived as autonomous beings varies greatly from culture to
culture, as does the behaviour that represents this emerging
autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy:
<font color="#a9a9a9">emotional autonomy, behavioural autonomy and
cognitive autonomy.</font> Emotional autonomy is defined by the
adolescent's relationships, and often involves the development of
more mature emotional relationships with adults and peers.
<font color="#dcdcdc">Behavioural </font>autonomy <font color="#2f4f4f">involves
the developing ability of young people to regulate their own
behaviour, act on their own decisions and control themselves</font>.
Cultural differences are particularly evident in this category as it
relates to socialising, social time with peers and time management
decisions. Cognitive autonomy describes <font color="#556b2f">an
adolescent's ability to engage in independent reasoning and
decision-making without over-reliance on social reinforcement</font>.
The combined effects of young people's cognitive development,
expanding social relationships, increasingly adult-like appearance
and increased acceptance of rights and responsibilities contribute to
their sense of autonomy. The proper development of autonomy has been

usually occurs a few years after the young person leaves home, young
people begin to open up to their family and close friends and
identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual. In the final stage, called
commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a way of
life. According to this model, the process of coming out thus begins
in childhood and continues into the twenties. This model has been

late adolescence, cliques often merge into mixed-gender groups as
teenagers begin to romantically socialise with each other. These
small groups of friends then break up further as the socialising
becomes more relationship-oriented. On a broader scale, young people

drug use is largely shaped <font color="#dcdcdc">by the substance use

that, more than actual drug use norms, an individual's perception of
illegal drug use by friends and peers is strongly related to his or

and this relationship strengthens over time. Whereas social
influences on alcohol and marijuana use tend to have a direct impact
in the short term, peer and friend norms about smoking in high school
have a profound effect on one's likelihood of smoking cigarettes well
into high school. Perhaps the strong correlation between peer

<font color="#228b22">Antarctic or its ice shelf </font>was sighted
in 1820 by ships captained by <font color="#a0522d">three </font>men:
<font color="#191970">von Bellingshausen (captain of the Russian
Imperial Navy), Edward Bransfield (captain of the Royal Navy) and
Nathaniel Palmer </font>(a sealer from Stonington, Connecticut). The
expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev <font color="#8b0000">in
the Vostok and Mirny, </font>reached <font color="#483d8b">32 km </font>from
Queen Maud's Land and sighted an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S
2°14′50″W / 69.35778°S 2.24722°W / -69.35778; -2.24722 west
longitude, known as the <font color="#3cb371">Fimbul Ice Shelf. </font>This
was three days before Bransfield sighted land and ten months before
<font color="#bc8f8f">Palmer </font>did in November 1820. The first
documented landing in Antarctica was apparently made by the American
sealer John Davis at Hughes Bay near Cape Charles in West Antarctica
on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim. The
first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in <font color="#663399">1895.</font></p>

the <font color="#dcdcdc">parties to the Antarctic Treaty began
negotiations on a convention to regulate mining in the Antarctic</font>.
A coalition of international organisations launched a public pressure
campaign to prevent mineral development in the region. The campaign
was largely led by <font color="#2f4f4f">Greenpeace International,
</font>which set up its own scientific station in the Ross Sea - the
World Park Base - and conducted annual expeditions to document the
human impact on the Antarctic environment. In <font color="#556b2f">1988</font>,
the Convention for <font color="#6b8e23">the Regulation of Antarctic
Mineral Resources </font>(CRAMRA) was adopted. However, the following
year <font color="#a0522d">Australia and France </font>announced that
they would not ratify the Convention, so it was effectively dead.
They proposed instead to negotiate a comprehensive regime to protect
the Antarctic environment in its place. Following the example of
other countries, the Protocol to the <font color="#228b22">Antarctic
Treaty on the </font>Protection of the Environment (<font color="#191970">Madrid
Protocol) </font>was negotiated and entered into force on 14 January
1998. The Madrid Protocol bans all mining activities in Antarctica

warming of West Antarctica is large, it has not led to any

</font><font color="#a0522d">decreases </font>with tropospheric

preventing Arctic temperatures from reaching the extremes typical of

(i.e. the Earth is furthest from the Sun during the Antarctic winter)
and at perihelion in January (i.e. the Earth is closest to the Sun
during the Antarctic summer). <font color="#483d8b">Orbital distance

that have </font>evolved under extreme conditions and have
contributed significantly to the impressive rock formations of the
McMurdo dry valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The seemingly
simple morphology, sparsely differentiated structures, metabolic
systems and enzymes that remain active at very low temperatures, and
shortened life cycles of these fungi make them particularly suited to
<font color="#a0522d">harsh </font>environments such as the McMurdo
Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and highly melanized
cells make them resistant to UV light. These characteristics can also
be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that they are

might have looked <font color="#191970">similar to Antarctic </font>fungi

endemic to Antarctica. Antarctic endemic fungi also include certain
dung-dwelling species that must have evolved to meet the dual

survive through the intestines of warm-blooded animals.</p>

dramatically and health infrastructure has been expanded. Due to
Eritrea's relative isolation, information and resources are very
limited and, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the
average life expectancy in 2008 was just under 63 years. Immunisation
and child nutrition have been addressed through close cooperation
with schools in a multisectoral approach; the number of children
vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years from 40.7%
<font color="#6b8e23">to 78.5%</font>, and child underweight was
reduced by 12% between 1995 and 1995-2002 (severe underweight
prevalence 28%). The National Malaria Control Unit of the Ministry of
Health has achieved huge improvements, reducing malaria mortality by
as much as <font color="#228b22">85% </font>and malaria cases by 92%

plant (later, the city of Arco became the first in the world to have
all its electricity generated by nuclear power, produced by
BORAX-III, another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National
Laboratory). The world's first commercial-scale nuclear power plant,
Obninsk in the USSR, started generating electricity with its AM-1

Hall in England, which started production on 17 October 1956, and the
Shippingport nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, which started

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1934, a group led by <font color="#a9a9a9">Enrico
Fermi </font>discovered that bombarding uranium with neutrons
produces beta radiation (electrons or positrons from the elements
produced; see beta particle). Fission products were initially thought
to be new elements with atomic numbers 93 and 94. Orso Mario Corbino,
<font color="#2f4f4f">Dean of the Faculty of Rome, </font>named them
ausonium and <font color="#6b8e23">hesperium.</font> The experiments
that led to uranium's ability to fission (break down) into lighter
elements and release bonding energy were carried out by Otto Hahn and
Fritz Strassmann at Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. <font color="#a0522d">Lise
Meitner </font>and her nephew, the physicist Otto Robert Frisch,
published a physical explanation in February 1939, naming the process
&quot;nuclear fission&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Fermi hypothesised
that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain
a fission reaction. This hypothesis was confirmed in 1939, and
subsequent work found that each fission of the rare isotope of
uranium, uranium-235, releases on average about 2.5 neutrons. A later
study found that the much more common isotope uranium-238 can be
converted to plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by
thermal neutrons. These discoveries prompted many countries to
develop nuclear weapons and nuclear power.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the Cold War, huge stockpiles
of uranium were built up between the Soviet Union and the United
States, and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using
enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up
of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600 short tons (540 metric
tons) of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium (enough to make <font color="#dcdcdc">40,000
warheads</font>) have been stored in often poorly guarded facilities
in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. In
Asia, Europe and South America, police interceptions of smuggled
shipments of bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, mostly from former
Soviet sources, have taken place at least between 1993 and 200516.
Between 1993 and 2005, the US Federal Government's Material
Protection, Control and Accounting Program spent some <font color="#556b2f">$550
million </font>to secure uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia.
The money was used for upgrades to research and storage facilities
and to improve security. Scientific American reported in February
2006 that security at some facilities was provided by chain-link
fences that were in a bad state of disrepair. According to an
interview for the article, at one facility, samples of enriched
(<font color="#6b8e23">weapons-grade</font>) uranium had been stored
in a broom cupboard before the upgrade project, and at another
facility, the stockpile of nuclear warheads had been monitored by
cards stored in a shoebox.</p>

neutrons, which makes up 0.7% of the naturally occurring element).
Uranium has the second highest atomic weight of all elements, lighter
only than plutonium. Its density is about 70% higher than that of
lead, but slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs
naturally in low concentrations, in the order of a few parts per

oscillator </font>generates a self-sustaining rhythm, driven by two
interactive feedback loops that are active at different times of the
day. The <font color="#dcdcdc">morning </font>loop consists of CCA1
(Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated
Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors
that regulate the circadian rhythm of Arabidopsis, and PRR 7 and 9
(Pseudo-Response Regulators). The <font color="#2f4f4f">evening </font>loop
consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in the regulation
of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under
continuous light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic and
mRNA signals are reduced, contributing to a negative feedback loop.
Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early
morning, while gene expression of TOC1 oscillates and peaks in the
early evening. Although it was previously assumed that these three
genes model a <font color="#6b8e23">negative feedback loop</font>,
with overexpressed CCA1 and LHY repressing TOC1 and overexpressed
TOC1 repressing CCA1 and LHY:A positive regulator of <font color="#228b22">TOC1,

observation and computational modelling of TOC1 gene functions and
interactions further suggest that the plant circadian clock is a

understanding is that the diurnal changes in ambient oxygen

meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and
reciprocal visits to and with the Pope. She has witnessed major
constitutional changes such as devolution in the United Kingdom,

to suppress Welsh nationalism by linking <font color="#a9a9a9">Elizabeth
</font>more closely to Wales. Proposals such as her appointment as
constable of Caernarfon Castle or as patron of the Welsh League of
Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) were dropped for various reasons,
including fears that Elizabeth would be associated with Urdd
conscientious objectors at a time when <font color="#dcdcdc">Britain

the idea, but <font color="#6b8e23">the King </font>rejected it

thought - she hoped - that if she were given time the relationship

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The intense media interest in the
opinions and private life of the royal family in the 1980s led to
numerous <font color="#a9a9a9">sensationalist stories in </font>the
press<font color="#a9a9a9">, </font>not all of which were entirely
true. As <font color="#dcdcdc">Kelvin MacKenzie, </font>editor of The
Sun, told his staff: &quot;Give me Sunday for a blurb on Monday's
royals. Never mind if it's not true - as long as it doesn't cause too
much of a stir afterwards.&quot; Newspaper editor Donald Trelford
wrote in The Observer on 21 September 1986: &quot;<font color="#556b2f">The
royal soap opera </font>has now reached such a level of public
interest that the line between fact and fiction has disappeared from
view.... It's not just that some papers won't check their facts or
accept denials: they don't care whether the stories are true or not.&quot;
In particular, the Sunday Times of 20 July 1986 reported that the
Queen was concerned that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies were
contributing to social division and that she was concerned about high
unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of the miners' strike
and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid
regime in South Africa. The rumours were sourced by royal aide
Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal,
among others, but Shea claimed his remarks had been taken out of
context and embellished with speculation. Thatcher is alleged to have
said that the Queen would vote for <font color="#6b8e23">the Social
Democratic Party - </font><font color="#a0522d">Thatcher's political
opponents</font>. Thatcher biographer John Campbell claimed that &quot;the
report was journalistic mischief&quot;. Thatcher later said she
personally admired the Queen, and the Queen gave Thatcher two of her
personal gifts - the Medal of Honour and a <font color="#228b22">knighthood
</font>- after <font color="#191970">John Major </font>replaced her
as Prime Minister. Former Canadian Prime Minister <font color="#8b0000">Brian

British Empire continued its transformation into <font color="#a9a9a9">a
Commonwealth</font>. By the time she took office in <font color="#dcdcdc">1952</font>,
her role as head of several independent states was well established.
In 1953, the Queen and her husband embarked on a seven-month

visit <font color="#228b22">Australia </font>and <font color="#191970">New
Zealand.</font> During the tour, crowds were huge; an estimated
three-quarters of the Australian population had seen him. Throughout
her reign, the Queen has made hundreds of state visits to other
countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she is the most travelled
Head of State.</p>

the late 1970s the Queen was concerned that the crown &quot;had
little meaning&quot; for Canadian Prime Minister <font color="#a9a9a9">Pierre
Trudeau.</font> Tony Benn said the Queen thought Trudeau was &quot;quite
a disappointment&quot;. Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be
reinforced by his antics, such as sliding down the railings of
Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in <font color="#dcdcdc">1977</font>,
and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of
office. In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the
patriarchy of <font color="#556b2f">the Canadian constitution </font>found
the Queen to be &quot;better informed ... than any British politician
or bureaucrat&quot;. She was particularly interested in the issue
after Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state,
had failed. The patriarchy removed the role of the <font color="#6b8e23">British
Parliament </font>from the Canadian constitution, but <font color="#a0522d">the
monarchy </font>remained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen
supported his attempt to <font color="#228b22">reform the
</font>constitution and that he was impressed by &quot;the Queen's
publicly demonstrated graciousness&quot; and &quot;her privately
demonstrated wisdom&quot;.</p>

criticism and public scrutiny. In a rare personal speech, the Queen
said that any institution should expect criticism, but suggested that
it should be presented with &quot;humour, gentleness and
understanding&quot;. Two days later, Prime Minister John Major
announced that reforms to the royal household had been planned since
the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993
and a reduction in the civil register. In December, Prince Charles
and his wife Diana formally divorced. The year ended with a lawsuit
when the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for copyright infringement when

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Sexual identity and sexual behaviour
are closely related to sexual orientation, but are distinguished in
that <font color="#a9a9a9">sexual identity refers to </font><font color="#dcdcdc">an
individual's self-concept</font><font color="#a9a9a9">, behaviour
refers to </font><font color="#2f4f4f">actual sexual acts performed
by the individual</font>, and orientation refers to &quot;<font color="#556b2f">fantasies,
affections and desires&quot;</font>. <font color="#6b8e23">Individuals
may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviour.
</font><font color="#a0522d">Individuals with a homosexual sexual
orientation that does not correspond to their sexual identity are
</font>sometimes referred to as &quot;<font color="#228b22">closeted</font>&quot;.
However, the term may reflect a particular cultural context and a
particular transitional phase in societies that are gradually
addressing the integration of sexual minorities. In studies of sexual
orientation, researchers usually use the terms <font color="#191970">concordance
</font><font color="#8b0000">or </font><font color="#483d8b">discordance
when </font>discussing the extent to which a person's sexual
attractions, behaviours and identity correspond. Thus, a woman who is
attracted to other women but calls herself heterosexual and has
sexual intercourse only with men can be said to experience a conflict
between her sexual orientation (homosexual or lesbian) and her sexual
identity and behaviour (heterosexual).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The earliest writers on sexual
orientation generally understood it to be closely linked to the
<font color="#a9a9a9">subject's own gender</font>. For example, <font color="#dcdcdc">it
was thought that a typical female person who was attracted to female
persons would have masculine traits and vice versa. </font>This view
was shared by most prominent sexual orientation theorists from the
mid-19th century to the early 20th century, such as <font color="#2f4f4f">Karl
Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld,
Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, as well as </font>many
gender reassigning homosexuals themselves. However, this view of
homosexuality as sexual inversion was controversial at the time, and
in the second half of the 20th century <font color="#556b2f">gender
identity increasingly came to be seen </font><font color="#6b8e23">as
a phenomenon separate from sexual orientation.</font> Transgender and
cisgender people may be attracted to men, women or both, although the
prevalence of different sexual orientations in these two groups is
quite different. An individual gay, straight or bisexual person may
be masculine, feminine or androgynous, and, in addition, many members
and supporters of the lesbian and gay communities now see
<font color="#a0522d">'</font><font color="#228b22">genderqueer
heterosexual' and 'gender non-conforming homosexual</font><font color="#a0522d">'
as </font>negative stereotypes. However, research by J. <font color="#191970">Michael

more nuanced nature of sexual identity and terminology. For example,
people may use other labels, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">pansexual
or polysexual, </font>or no label at all. According to the American
Psychological Association, sexual orientation &quot;also refers to <font color="#dcdcdc">a
person's sense of identity based on these attractions, associated
behaviours, and membership in a community of others who share these
attractions</font>&quot;. <font color="#2f4f4f">Androphilia and
gynophilia </font>are terms used in the behavioural sciences to
describe sexual orientation as an alternative to the binary concept
of gender. Androphilia describes <font color="#556b2f">sexual
attraction to masculinity</font>; gynephilia describes <font color="#6b8e23">sexual
attraction to femininity.</font> The term sexual preference largely
overlaps with sexual orientation, but the two are usually
distinguished in psychological research. For example, a person who
identifies as bisexual may have a sexual preference for one sex over
the other. Sexual preference may also indicate some degree of
voluntary choice, whereas the scientific consensus is that sexual
orientation is not a choice.</p>

categories of sexual orientation used today: </font>heterosexual,

reflects the fact that people <font color="#a9a9a9">in the survey
give inconsistent responses to different aspects of sexual
orientation and that their responses are unstable over time</font>.
Laumann et al. (1994) found that among US adults, 20% of those who
would be considered homosexual on one aspect of orientation were
homosexual on two other dimensions, and 70% responded homosexually on
only one of the three dimensions. Furthermore, sexuality is fluid, so
<font color="#dcdcdc">sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or
consistent over time, but can change throughout life. </font>Diamond
(2003) found that <font color="#2f4f4f">over a seven-year period,
two-thirds of women changed their sexual identity at least once, </font>and
many of them reported that the label did not adequately describe the

measure sexual orientation. Most empirical and clinical research on
LGBT populations has been conducted with largely <font color="#556b2f">white,
middle-class, and well-educated </font>samples, but there are studies
that document a variety of other cultural groups, although these
studies are often limited in terms of the gender and sexual
orientation diversity of the subjects<font color="#556b2f">.</font>
Linking sexual orientation and socio-cultural identity can be a
challenge for LGBT people. Individuals may or may not consider that
their sexual orientation defines their sexual identity, as they may
experience varying degrees of sexuality, or they may simply identify
more strongly with another aspect of their identity, such as their
family role. American culture places great emphasis on <font color="#6b8e23">individual
characteristics and considers the self to </font>be<font color="#6b8e23">
immutable and permanent.</font> East Asian cultures, on the other
hand, place great emphasis on a person's social role in the social
hierarchy and view the self as changeable and malleable. These
different cultural views have many implications for self-concepts,
including the perception of sexual orientation.</p>

two different approaches to assessing sexual orientation until
well-positioned, psychometrically reliable and tested definitions are
developed to reliably assess the prevalence, causes and consequences
of homosexuality. First, he <font color="#dcdcdc">suggests that
sexual arousal and attraction be given a higher priority </font>than
behaviour and identity, because it is less vulnerable to
self-deception and deception by others, social circumstances and
variable meanings. To measure attraction and arousal, he suggests
<font color="#2f4f4f">developing and using biological measures.</font>
There are numerous biological/physiological measures of sexual
orientation such as sexual arousal, brain scans, eye tracking, body
odour preference and anatomical variations such as finger length
ratio and right or left handedness. Second, Savin-Williams suggests
that <font color="#556b2f">researchers should abandon sexual
orientation altogether </font>and <font color="#6b8e23">assess only
those elements that are relevant to the research question being

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">These studies suggest that the
<font color="#a9a9a9">sexual arousal patterns of men and women differ
</font>and that this is also reflected <font color="#dcdcdc">in the

(<font color="#2f4f4f">attraction, behaviour, identity</font>), of
which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attraction that
can currently be measured with any degree of physical precision.
Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing primates having sex
does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of
sexual attraction. Some researchers argue that women's sexual
orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than
men's and that other aspects of sexual orientation (such as <font color="#556b2f">emotional

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Initially Dell did not focus on <font color="#a9a9a9">the
consumer market </font>because the cost of selling to individuals and
households was higher and profit margins too low; this changed when
the company's Internet site began to be successful in <font color="#2f4f4f">1997-1996</font>.
As the industry average selling price to individuals fell, Dell's
price <font color="#556b2f">rose, as </font>second and third computer
buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and low
technical support chose Dell. Dell found an opportunity among
computer-savvy individuals who liked the fact that they could buy
direct, customise the computer to their needs and have it delivered
in a few days. In early 1997, Dell set up an internal sales and
marketing team to serve the domestic market and introduced a range of
products designed specifically for individual users.</p>

mid-1990s, </font>Dell expanded beyond desktops and laptops by
selling servers, starting with low-end servers<font color="#a9a9a9">.
The </font>three largest <font color="#2f4f4f">server suppliers at
the time were </font>IBM, Hewlett Packard and Compaq, and many
servers were based on proprietary technologies such as IBM's Power4
microprocessors or various versions of the Unix operating system.
Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require large investments in
proprietary technology, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel
chips and could be built more cheaply than competitors. Consequently,
Dell's corporate revenues, which were almost non-existent in 1994,
accounted for 13 % of the company's total revenues by <font color="#6b8e23">1998.
</font>Three years later, Dell overtook <font color="#a0522d">Compaq
as </font>the leading supplier of Intel-based servers with 31 %
market share. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999, when it
bought ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million after Dell had
failed to develop an enterprise installation system on its own;
ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit Dell's
commodity provider business model, forcing Dell to write down the
value of the entire acquisition.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The slowdown in sales growth has
been attributed to the maturation of the PC market, which accounted
for 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts have suggested that Dell should
make a breakthrough in non-PC business segments such as storage,
server and server markets. Dell's price advantage was linked to its
very light manufacturing of desktop PCs, but its importance
diminished as savings became harder to find in the company's supply
chain and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer streamlined
their PC manufacturing operations in the same way as Dell, eroding
Dell's traditional price differential. In the computer industry as a
whole, the fall in prices and the corresponding increase in
performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to sell its
products to customers (a profitable strategy whereby buyers are
encouraged to upgrade processor or memory). As a result, the company
sold more low-cost computers, which eroded profit margins. The
notebook PC segment had become the fastest growing segment of the PC
market, but Dell, like other PC manufacturers, was producing low-cost
notebooks in China, which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost
advantages. In addition, Dell's dependence on Internet sales meant
that it was excluded from the growing sales of notebooks in <font color="#556b2f">large
online stores. </font><font color="#6b8e23">CNET </font>has suggested
that Dell was becoming trapped in the increasing commoditisation of
high-volume, low-margin PCs, which prevented it from offering the
more exciting devices that consumers demand.</p>

</font><font color="#dcdcdc">2000s, </font>Dell's &quot;configure to
order&quot; approach, whereby Dell manufactures and supplies
individual computers configured to customer specifications from its
US facilities, was no longer as efficient or competitive as the
high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as computers became powerful
cheap commodities. Dell closed its North American desktop computer
manufacturing plants, including <font color="#2f4f4f">the Mort Topfer
Manufacturing Center </font>in Austin, Texas (original location) and
Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009. The
desktop PC plant in Winston-Salem<font color="#556b2f">, North
Carolina, </font>received USD 280 million in incentives from the
State and opened in 2005, but closed in November 2010. Dell's
contract with the State required Dell to repay the incentives for
non-compliance, and Dell sold the North Carolina plant <font color="#6b8e23">to
Herbalife.</font> Most of the work previously done in Dell's US
plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico
or to some of Dell's own plants abroad. The Alienware subsidiary's
manufacturing plant in Miami, <font color="#a0522d">Florida </font>is
still in operation, and Dell continues to manufacture its servers
(its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas. On 8 January 2009,
Dell announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick,
Ireland, resulting in the loss of 1 900 jobs and the transfer of
production to a plant in Łódź, Poland.</p>

after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that its
prospects were bleak and that it would need several years out of the

</font><font color="#dcdcdc">Elliott Management</font>, a hedge fund
that owns 2.2% of EMC's shares, pressured EMC to restructure its
unusual 'federation structure', in which EMC's divisions were
effectively run as independent companies. Elliott argued that this
structure undervalued EMC's core EMC II data storage business and
that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was
confusing the market and harming both companies. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Wall
Street Journal </font>estimates that in 2014 Dell had revenues of
$27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9 billion from servers,
while EMC had revenues of $16.5 billion from EMC II, $1 billion from
RSA Security, $6 billion from VMware and $230 million from Pivotal
Software. EMC owns about 80 % of VMware's shares. Under the proposed
acquisition, VMware will remain a separate company, held through a
new monitoring division, while the other parts of EMC will be merged
into Dell. Once the acquisition is completed, Dell will again publish
quarterly financial results, having stopped publishing them after
going private in <font color="#556b2f">2013.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Dell had a reputation as a company
that relied on <font color="#a9a9a9">supply chain efficiency </font>to
sell established technology at low prices, rather than being an
innovator. By the mid-2000s, many analysts saw innovative companies
as the next source of growth for the technology sector. Dell's low
<font color="#dcdcdc">R&amp;D spending </font>relative to revenue
(compared to IBM, Hewlett Packard and Apple Inc) - which worked well
in the commodity market - prevented it from entering more profitable
segments such as MP3 players and later mobile devices. Increased R&amp;D
spending would have cut into the operating margins the company was
emphasising. Dell had done well with <font color="#2f4f4f">a

moved to horizontal aggregation layers in the 1980s, but by the

its offerings of servers, networks, software and services to the

heritage to build close customer relationships and design solutions
for customers. Although the company spent <font color="#2f4f4f">$13

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In July 2009, Dell apologised after
incurring the wrath of the Taiwan Consumer Protection Commission for
twice refusing to fulfil orders placed against unusually low prices
offered on its Taiwanese website. In the first case, Dell offered a
<font color="#dcdcdc">19-inch </font>LCD panel for $15. In the second
case, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 laptop for NT$18 558 (USD 580),
<font color="#2f4f4f">70% </font>below the normal price of NT$60 900
(USD 1900). For the E4300, instead of honouring the discount and
incurring substantial losses, the company cancelled orders and
offered the customer a coupon of NT$20 000 (US$625) as compensation.
The Taiwanese consumer authorities fined Dell <font color="#556b2f">NT$1
million </font>(US$31250) for violating customer rights. Many
consumers sued the company for unfair compensation. A court in
southern Taiwan ordered the company to supply 31 consumers with 18
laptops and 76 flat-screen TVs at a price of US$ 490 000 (US$ 15
120), less than a third of the normal price. According to the court,
the incident can hardly be considered a mistake, as the respected
company had mispriced its products twice on a Taiwanese website
within three weeks.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Despite plans to expand into other
global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on
the <font color="#a9a9a9">US </font>business PC market, with desktop
PCs sold to both commercial and business customers accounting for <font color="#2f4f4f">32%
of </font>its revenue, 85% of its revenue coming from businesses and
64% of its revenue coming from the Americas, according to Dell's
third quarter 2006 results. Shipments of desktop PCs in the US were
in decline, and the corporate PC market, which buys computers on
upgrade cycles, had largely decided to take a break from buying new
systems. The last upgrade cycle began around 2002, some three years
after businesses started buying PCs before the Y2K problems were
identified, and business customers were not expected to upgrade again
until <font color="#6b8e23">Microsoft's Windows Vista operating
system </font>was widely tested (estimated to be early 2007), so the
next upgrade cycle will be around 2008. As Dell is heavily dependent
on PCs, it had to reduce prices in order to increase sales, while at
the same time demanding large cuts from suppliers.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The release of Apple's iPad desktop
computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC suppliers
as consumers moved away from desktops and laptops. Dell's own
mobility division has failed to develop smartphones or tablets,
whether running Windows or Google Android. The Dell <font color="#2f4f4f">Streak
</font>failed commercially and critically due to its outdated
operating system, numerous bugs and low resolution screen. InfoWorld
speculated that Dell and other original equipment manufacturers saw
the tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity to run Google
Android, which ignored the user interface and failed to generate
long-term consumer interest in the market. Dell has responded by
marketing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS, which do not compete with
Apple's iPad and Kindle Fire tablets. The growing popularity of
smartphones and tablets over PCs led to a loss in Dell's consumer
segment in the third quarter of 2012. In December 2012, Dell suffered
its first Christmas sales decline in five years despite the launch of
Windows 8.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Dell's reputation for poor <font color="#a9a9a9">customer
service </font>since 2002, which worsened as it moved its call
centres <font color="#dcdcdc">overseas </font>and as its growth
outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under
increasing scrutiny on the internet. The original Dell model was
known for high customer satisfaction when computers sold in the
thousands, but in the 2000s the company could not justify this level
of service when computers of the same model sold in the hundreds.
Rollins responded by moving <font color="#2f4f4f">Dick Hunter </font>from
Production Manager to Customer Service Manager. Hunter, noting that
Dell's DNA-style cost-cutting was 'getting in the way', sought to
reduce call transfer times and get call centre representatives to
resolve enquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent <font color="#556b2f">$100
million </font>in a few months to improve this and had introduced
DellConnect, which allows customers' queries to be answered more
quickly. In July 2006, the company launched the Direct2Dell blog, and
in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, where he asked
customers for advice on selling Linux computers and reducing
&quot;bloatware&quot; on PCs, among other things. These initiatives
succeeded in reducing the number of negative blog posts from 49% to
22% and in reducing the &quot;Dell Hell&quot; moniker that featured
prominently in Internet search engines.</p>

closure of one of its largest Canadian call centres in Kanata,
Ontario, laying off approximately 1100 employees, of which 500 were
made redundant immediately and the official closure of the centre is
planned for the summer. The call centre opened in 2006 after the City
of Ottawa won the tender to locate it. Less than a year later, Dell
planned to double its workforce to nearly 3<font color="#2f4f4f">,000
</font>employees and add a new building. These plans were cancelled
because the high exchange rate of the Canadian dollar made staffing
in Ottawa relatively expensive and because Dell's economic recovery
measures included moving these call centre jobs overseas to cut
costs. The company had also announced the closure of its Edmonton,
Alberta office, resulting in the loss of 900 jobs. In total, Dell
announced that it would cut around 8 800 jobs between 2007 and 2008,

EMEA market </font>at its Limerick plant in the Republic of Ireland,
and at one time employed around 4<font color="#dcdcdc">,500 </font>people
in the country. Dell started manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and
became Ireland's largest exporter of goods and Ireland's second
largest company and foreign investor. On 8 January 2009, Dell
announced that it would transfer all Dell manufacturing in Limerick
to Dell's new plant in Łódź, Poland, by January 2010. European
Union officials announced that they were investigating a <font color="#556b2f">€52.7
million </font>aid package used by the Polish government to lure Dell
out of Ireland. The European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened
in 1990) and EMF3 are part of the Raheen Industrial Estate near
Limerick. EMF2 (formerly the Wang facility, later taken over by
Flextronics and located in Castletroy) was closed in 2002 and Dell
Inc. has concentrated its production at EMF3 (EMF1 now[when?] has
only offices). Subsidies from the Polish government kept Dell in
business for a long time. After the closure of the Limerick assembly
plant, the Cherrywood Technology Campus in Dublin was Dell's largest
site in the Republic, employing over 1200 people in sales (mainly in
the UK and Ireland), support services (EMEA business support) and
cloud R&amp;D, but no longer manufacturing, with the exception of
Dell's Alienware subsidiary, which manufactures computers at the
Athlone plant in Ireland. It is not certain whether this plant will
remain in Ireland. Construction of EMF4 in Łódź, Poland has
started[update]: Dell started production there in autumn 2007.</p>

collateral appeal </font>(in a federal death penalty case, it
proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus).
While all states have some form of collateral review, the process
varies widely from state to state. Generally speaking, the purpose of
these collateral proceedings is to allow the prisoner to challenge
his or her sentence on grounds that could not reasonably have been
raised at trial or on direct review. Most often, these are arguments,
such as <font color="#dcdcdc">ineffective assistance of trial
counsel, that </font>require the court to consider new evidence
outside the original trial record, which courts cannot do in a normal
appeal. While the state appellate process is an important step
because it helps determine the scope of federal habeas corpus
proceedings, it is rarely successful as such. Only about 1 percent of
<font color="#2f4f4f">6death sentences </font>are overturned on state
collateral review. In 2010, death sentences of prisoners53 were
overturned as a result of judicial review or reversal by the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Traditionally, Section 1983 has been
used only in the case of a state prisoner with a limited death
sentence, because the Supreme Court has held that <font color="#a9a9a9">habeas
corpus</font>, not Section 1983, is the only means by which a state
prisoner can challenge his death sentence. In <font color="#2f4f4f">Hill2006
v. McDonough</font>, however, the US Supreme Court upheld the use of
Section 1983 as a means to challenge a state's method of execution as
cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the <font color="#556b2f">Eighth
</font>Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner who brings such a
challenge is not directly attacking the death penalty, but rather the
means by which the sentence is carried out. Therefore, in Hill, the
Supreme Court held that a prisoner may use Section 1983 rather than
habeas corpus to bring suit. However, as Clarence Hill's own case
demonstrates, lower federal courts have often refused to entertain
suits against methods of execution on the grounds that the prisoner
brought the suit too late and only for the purpose of delay. In
addition, the Court's decision in <font color="#6b8e23">Baze v. Rees,
</font>which upheld the lethal injection method used by several

woman had been gradually abolished in the United States, and at the

The 2008 decision in <font color="#6b8e23">Kennedy v. Louisiana

cases where the defendant has taken the life of another human being.
The current federal kidnapping statute may be an exception, however,
because the death penalty applies if the victim dies in the
perpetrator's possession, not necessarily at his hands, and thus
requires a fatal death, which was the wording of the objection. In
addition, the federal government retains the death penalty for
non-homicide crimes that are considered crimes against the state,

this article, Americans have maintained their position in favour of
the death penalty for murder. However, when given a choice between
the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole, support has
traditionally been significantly lower than in surveys where the
death penalty is mentioned only as a punishment. For example, in
2010, 49% in one poll favoured the death penalty and 46% the life
sentence, while in another poll 61% said they preferred another
punishment to the death penalty. The highest support for the death
penalty was 80% in <font color="#a9a9a9">1994 </font>(<font color="#a9a9a9">16%
</font>opposed in <font color="#a9a9a9">1994</font>) and the lowest
support was 42% in 1966 (<font color="#dcdcdc">47% </font>opposed).
On the question of death penalty versus life without parole, the
highest support for the death penalty was 61% in 1997 (<font color="#2f4f4f">29%

of prisoners on death row, compared with only 12.6% of the total
population (they have accounted for 1% of those executed34 since
1976), but this figure is lower than the percentage of prisoners in

African Americans made up 52.5% of homicide offenders between 1980

This means that African-Americans are less likely to be executed on a

report, blacks and whites were almost equally likely to be murdered,
but 80% of those executed since 1977 were convicted of murders whose

death penalty in the United States is complex. It typically involves
<font color="#a9a9a9">four </font>critical steps: (1) sentencing, (2)
direct review, (3) state collateral review, and (4) federal habeas
corpus. Recently, the narrow and final, fifth level of process - (5)
Section 1983 challenge - has become increasingly important. (A pardon
or reprieve, which allows <font color="#dcdcdc">the governor </font>or
president of a jurisdiction to unilaterally commute or revoke a death
sentence, is an executive rather than judicial process.) The number
of new death sentences peaked between 1995 and 1996 (<font color="#2f4f4f">309</font>).
There were 73 new death sentences in <font color="#556b2f">2014</font>,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since then (<font color="#a9a9a9">164213
</font>in the colonial, Articles of Confederation and present-day
United States), the states and the federal government have executed
an estimated 364 juvenile offenders. The earliest known execution of
a prisoner convicted of a juvenile offence was Thomas Graunger in
<font color="#2f4f4f">1642</font>. Since 1976, <font color="#556b2f">22
</font>of these executions have taken place in seven states. Because
of the slow appeals process, it was very unusual for a convict to be
under 18 at the time of execution. The youngest person executed in
the 20th century was George Stinney, who was electrocuted in South
Carolina on 16 <font color="#6b8e23">14 June </font>1944. The last
execution of a juvenile was probably Leonard Shockley, who died <font color="#a0522d">in
a </font>Maryland <font color="#a0522d">gas chamber on </font>10
April 1959 at the age of 17. No one has been under 19 at the time of
execution since at least 1964. Since the death penalty was
reintroduced in 1976, 22 people have been executed for crimes
committed when they were under 18. Twenty-one of them were aged 17 at
the time of the offence. The last person to be executed for a
juvenile offence was Scott Hain on 3 April 2003 in Oklahoma.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Around 1890 , a political movement
developed in the United States that wanted to impose private
executions. Several states passed laws requiring executions to be
carried out within a &quot;wall&quot; or &quot;enclosure&quot; to
&quot;exclude public view&quot;. For example, in <font color="#dcdcdc">1919</font>,
the Missouri legislature passed a law (L.1919, p. 781) requiring that
&quot;the death sentence should be executed in the county jail if
convenient, and otherwise in an enclosure in the vicinity of the
jail&quot;. Missouri law allowed <font color="#556b2f">the local
sheriff to </font>issue passes to persons (usually local citizens)
whom he believed would witness <font color="#6b8e23">a hanging, </font>but
sheriffs - for various reasons - sometimes denied passes to persons
who wished to witness the event. Missouri executions after 1919 were
not 'public' because they were carried out behind closed walls and
the public was not allowed to attend.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the decades since Furman, new
questions have arisen about whether prosecutorial arbitrariness has
replaced the arbitrariness of sentencing. A study published in the
Temple Law Review of <font color="#a9a9a9">Pepperdine University
</font>School of Law, &quot;Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice:
An Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions,&quot;
examined the prosecutorial decision-making process in various states.
The authors found that prosecutors' death penalty decisions continue
to be marked by local &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot;, suggesting that
they do not comply with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive.
This means that &quot;the very injustices that the Supreme Court
sought to eliminate&quot; can still &quot;infect death sentences&quot;.
The wide discretion of prosecutors is preserved by overly broad
criteria. For example, California law has &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">22
special </font>circumstances&quot; that make almost all premeditated
murders potential death penalty cases. The 32 states with death
penalty laws have varying numbers and types of &quot;death penalty
conditions&quot; - circumstances that allow for the death penalty.
The number ranges from 34 in California to 22 in Colorado and
Delaware and 12 in Texas, Nebraska, Georgia and Montana. The authors
of the study called for a reform of state procedures along the lines
of the reforms of the federal system <font color="#2f4f4f">initiated
by the US Department of Justice in a 1995 protocol.</font> Death
penalty offences vary by jurisdiction. All jurisdictions that use the
death penalty define capital murder as a capital offence, although
most jurisdictions require aggravating circumstances. Treason against
the United States and treason against the states of Arkansas,
California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri are capital
offences.</p>

government <font color="#a9a9a9">on the social contract theory that
</font>permeated Enlightenment political thought. The English
philosopher <font color="#dcdcdc">Thomas Hobbes </font>initiated this

of the foundations of European liberal thought: individual rights,
the natural equality of all people, the <font color="#2f4f4f">artificial
nature of the political order </font>(which later led to the
separation of civil society and the state), the view that all
legitimate political power must be 'representative' and based on

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Both Rousseau's and Locke's social
contract theories are based on the assumption of natural rights,
which are not the product of law or custom, but things that all
people have before political societies, and are therefore universal
and inalienable. The best-known formulation of natural rights comes
from John Locke's <font color="#a9a9a9">Second Treatise, </font>in
which he presents the state of nature. According to Locke, natural
law is based on mutual security, the <font color="#dcdcdc">idea that
no one can violate the natural rights of another </font>because all
men are equal and have the same inalienable rights<font color="#dcdcdc">.
</font>These natural rights include <font color="#2f4f4f">full
equality and freedom, and the right to preserve life and property</font>.
Locke also argued against slavery on the grounds that enslaving
yourself is against the natural law; you cannot give up your rights,
your freedom is absolute and no one can take it away from you.
Furthermore, Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another
<font color="#556b2f">because it is morally reprehensible</font>,
although he does issue a caveat by saying that <font color="#6b8e23">enslaving
a lawful prisoner in time of war would not be against one's natural

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Enlightenment religious commentary
was a response to the previous century of religious conflict in
Europe, notably <font color="#a9a9a9">the Thirty Years' War</font>.
Enlightenment theologians wanted to reform their faith to its
generally non-Christian roots and to limit the spillover of religious
controversy into politics and warfare, while maintaining a genuine
belief in God. For moderate Christians, this meant <font color="#dcdcdc">a
return to a simple Bible</font>. John Locke abandoned the collection
of theological commentaries in favour of an &quot;unprejudiced
examination&quot; of God's word alone. He defined the core of
Christianity as faith in Christ the Redeemer and recommended <font color="#2f4f4f">avoiding

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Enlightenment has always been a
controversial area. Its proponents &quot;see it as the source of all
that is progressive in the modern world. For them, it represents
freedom of thought, rational inquiry, critical thinking, religious
tolerance, political freedom, scientific achievement, the pursuit of
happiness and hope for the future.&quot; But its opponents accuse it
of &quot;superficial&quot; rationalism, naive optimism, unrealistic
universalism and moral darkness. From the beginning, there was a
counter-enlightenment in which conservative and ecclesiastical
defenders of traditional religion attacked <font color="#a9a9a9">materialism

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There is no consensus on the exact
date of the Enlightenment, with the early 17th century (1701) or the
mid-1700s (1650) often being used as the period. French historians
generally place the period known as <font color="#a9a9a9">the Siècle
des Lumières (Age of Enlightenment) </font>between 1715 and 1789,
from the beginning of <font color="#dcdcdc">Louis XV's </font>reign
until the French Revolution. If the Enlightenment dates back to the
mid-16th century, its origins can be traced to Descartes' Discourse
on Method, published in 1637. In France, the publication of Isaac
Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687 was cited by many. Several
historians and philosophers have argued that the beginning of the
Enlightenment was when Descartes, in his 1637 work cogito ergo sum,
shifted the epistemological foundation from external authority to
internal certainty. Most scholars use the last years of the twentieth
century as the end of the Enlightenment, often choosing the <font color="#6b8e23">French

increased the autonomy and self-awareness of society and the growing

expanded, it encompassed a wide range of institutions; the most
commonly mentioned were cafés and coffee shops, salons and the
public sphere of literature, figuratively located in the Republic of
Literature. In France, the emergence of the public sphere was
facilitated by the aristocracy's move from the royal palace of
Versailles to Paris around 1720, as the aristocracy's lavish spending
encouraged trade in luxury goods and artistic creations, especially

Enlightenment values was Charles Burney's A General History of Music:
From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period (<font color="#2f4f4f">1776</font>),
a historical survey and attempt to systematically rationalise the
elements of music over time. More recently, musicologists have shown
a renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the
Enlightenment. For example, Rose Rosengard Subotnik's Deconstructive
Variations (subtitled Music and Reason in Western Society) compares
Mozart's <font color="#556b2f">Die Zauberflöte (1791) </font>through

a private library, and although most of the state-run &quot;public

other extreme was the Bibliothèque Bleue, a collection of cheaply

</font>Aimed at a <font color="#dcdcdc">largely rural and illiterate

Naturalists served the <font color="#2f4f4f">desire for erudition of
</font>the sophisticated society - many texts had an explicitly
educational purpose. But natural history was often a political issue.
As E. C. Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists 'slide
between nature and society ... to prove not only the expertise of
naturalists in the natural but also the dominance of nature over
society'. The idea of <font color="#556b2f">taste (le goût) </font>was
a social indicator: to truly classify nature, one had to have the
right taste, a discernment common to all members of polite society.
In this way, natural history disseminated many of the scientific
developments of the age, but also provided a new source of legitimacy
for the ruling class. On this basis, natural scientists could then
develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.</p>

articles, treatises and books published by academies and scientists.
Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as a 'wholly new
work' containing 'short and easy [sic] rules and astronomical
tables'. The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the
Principia was Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton,
published in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Principia, </font>published after his death in 1756, also helped to
spread Newton's theories beyond the academies of science and the
university. Francesco Algarotti, writing for a growing female
audience, published Il Newtonianism per le dame, a hugely popular
work translated from Italian into English by Elizabeth Carter. A
similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was written by Henry
Pembarton. His A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy was published
on commission. There are records of subscribers to the book being
bought by women from different social backgrounds, indicating that
there was a growing middle class of female science-minded readers.

Enlightenment thinkers developed a 'human science' that was
historically manifested in the works of James Burnett, Adam Ferguson,
John Millar and William Robertson, among others, all of whom combined
scientific research into how people behaved in ancient and primitive
cultures with a strong awareness of the forces that shape modernity.
Modern sociology was largely inspired by this movement, and Hume's

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Both <font color="#a9a9a9">Locke </font>and
<font color="#dcdcdc">Rousseau </font>developed social contract
theories in their Two Treatises of Government and Discourse on
Inequality. Although Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau are quite different
works, they agreed that <font color="#2f4f4f">a social contract, </font>in
which the power of government is based on the consent of the
governed, is necessary for man to live in a civil society. Locke
defines the state of nature as a state in which men are rational and
obey the natural law, in which all men are born equal, and in which
they have the right to life, liberty and property. However, when one
citizen violates the law of nature, both the violator and the victim
enter a <font color="#556b2f">state of war from which it is </font>virtually
impossible to escape. This is why Locke said that individuals join
civil society to protect their natural rights through an &quot;impartial
judge&quot; or a common authority, such as the courts, to appeal to.
In contrast, Rousseau's view is based on the assumption that &quot;civil
man&quot; is depraved, while &quot;natural man&quot; has no desire
that he cannot fulfill himself. The natural man is only removed from
the natural state when the inequalities of private property are
realised. According to Rousseau, people join civil society through a
social contract in <font color="#6b8e23">order to achieve unity while
preserving individual freedom.</font> This is expressed in the
sovereignty of the common will, the moral and collective legislative
body of citizens.</p>

formed an international network of like-minded men who often met in
secret for ritual programmes in their lodges, promoting Enlightenment
ideals and helping to spread these values in Britain, France and
elsewhere. Freemasonry as a systematic religion with its own myths,
values and rituals originated <font color="#a9a9a9">in Scotland
</font>around 1600 and spread first <font color="#dcdcdc">to England
</font>and then to the continent in the 1700s. The Scottish soldiers
and Jacobite monks brought to the continent ideals of brotherhood
that reflected not the local Scottish customary system, but
institutions and ideals that originated in the English revolution
against royal absolutism. <font color="#2f4f4f">Freemasonry </font>was

Freemasons showed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and
ceremonies. In France, Germany, Sweden and Russia, similar societies
arose, some of which imitated Freemasonry. One example was the

Enlightenment ideas to the New World and influencing British and

Atlantic. Thinkers such as Paine, Locke and Rousseau held up Native
American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom. Americans

some French thinkers such as Montesquieu. As deists, they were
influenced by the ideas of <font color="#2f4f4f">John Toland

was a period of strong emphasis on freedom, democracy, republicanism

private model for public affairs. They &quot;reconstituted society
and created a form of constitutional self-government, with
constitutions and laws, elections and representatives&quot;. In other
words, the micro-society created by the lodges provided a normative
model for society as a whole. This was particularly true in
continental Europe: when the first lodges began to appear in <font color="#a9a9a9">the

embodied <font color="#dcdcdc">British </font>values. For example,
the <font color="#2f4f4f">Parisian lodge of the </font>mid-1720s was
made up of English Jacobite deserters. In addition, Freemasons across
Europe explicitly associated themselves with the Enlightenment as a
whole. In French lodges, for example, the line &quot;As an instrument
of enlightenment, I seek the enlightened&quot; was part of their
initiation rites. The <font color="#556b2f">British </font>lodges
gave themselves the task of 'initiating the unenlightened'. This did
not necessarily associate the Lodges with the irreligious, but it did
not exclude them from the occasional heresy either. In fact, many

politics. Cafés were essential <font color="#dcdcdc">to the
Enlightenment as </font>centres of free thought and self-discovery<font color="#dcdcdc">.</font>
While many café patrons were learned, a large number were not. Cafés
attracted a wide range of people, including not only the educated
wealthy but also members of the bourgeoisie and the lower classes.
While it may seem positive that the customers, who were doctors,
lawyers, shopkeepers, etc., represented almost all classes, the café
environment created fear in those who sought to maintain class
distinctions. One of the most popular critics of the café argued
that it 'enabled relations between people of different social
classes, from the artisan to the aristocrat' and was therefore
compared to Noah's Ark, which received all kinds of animals, clean or

centred on reason as the primary source of authority and
justification, and promoted ideals such as liberty, progress,
tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government and an end to church
and state abuses. In France, the central tenets of the Lumière were

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Enlightenment saw the
development of many new ideas about religion, such as deism and
atheism. According to Thomas Paine, deism is a <font color="#a9a9a9">simple
belief in a Creator God, without reference to the Bible or any other
miraculous source.</font> Instead, the deist relies solely on
personal reason as a guide to his creed, which was very appealing to
many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much debated but few
adherents. Wilson and Reill note that 'in fact, very few enlightened
intellectuals were true atheists, although they were vocal critics of
Christianity. Rather, they were critics of the orthodox faith who
were more attached to scepticism, deism, vitalism or perhaps
pantheism.&quot; Some followed <font color="#dcdcdc">Pierre Bayle </font>and
argued that atheists could indeed be moral people. Many others, like
<font color="#2f4f4f">Voltaire, argued </font>that without a belief
in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society would be
undermined. In other words, because atheists did not submit to any
supreme authority or law and did not fear eternal consequences, they
were much more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647-1706) noted
that in his day, 'reasonable men always retain the appearance of
[religion]'. He believed that even atheists could hold notions of
honour and transcend self-interest in order to create and interact in
society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the
result would be moral anarchy: each individual 'could have no law but
his own will, no end but himself'. He would be a god to himself, and
the satisfaction of his own will would be the sole measure and end of
all his actions&quot;.</p>

the highest level of inclusiveness - a public space should, by
definition, be open to all. However, this sphere was public only to a
relative extent. Enlightenment thinkers often contrasted their

during the Enlightenment begins with the Academy of Sciences, founded
in <font color="#a9a9a9">Paris in 1635.</font> It was closely linked
to the French state and served as an extension of a government in
serious need of scientists. It helped to promote and organise new
scientific disciplines and trained new scientists. It also helped to
improve the social status of <font color="#dcdcdc">scientists, who
</font>were considered to be the &quot;most useful citizens&quot;.
The Academies show that interest in science has grown in parallel
with its increasing secularisation, as evidenced by the small number
of clergy members (<font color="#2f4f4f">13%)</font>. The presence of
the French Academies in the public sphere is not due to their
membership; although the majority of members were bourgeois, the
exclusive institution was open only to <font color="#556b2f">elite
Parisian scientists. </font>They saw themselves as &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">interpreters
of science to the people</font>&quot;. With this in mind, the
academics took it upon themselves, for example, to refute the
pseudoscience of popular mesmerism.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In general, Enlightenment science
highly valued empiricism and rational thinking, and was linked to the
Enlightenment ideal of progress and advancement. The study of science
under natural philosophy was divided into physics and a conglomerate
of chemistry and <font color="#a9a9a9">natural history</font>,
comprising anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy and zoology. As with
most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not
universally seen; <font color="#dcdcdc">Rousseau </font>criticised
the natural sciences for distancing man from nature and for not
contributing to human happiness. Enlightenment science was dominated
by <font color="#2f4f4f">scientific societies and academies</font>,
which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific
research and development. Societies and academies were also the
backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another
important development was the popularisation of science among an
increasingly literate population. Philosophers introduced the public
to many scientific theories, in particular through the popularisation
of the Encyclopédie and the <font color="#556b2f">Newtonianism of
</font>Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have
considered the <font color="#6b8e23">1700s to be </font>a dull period
in the history of science; however, the century saw significant
advances in medicine, mathematics and physics, the development of
biological taxonomy, a new understanding of magnetism and
electricity, and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, laying
the foundations for modern chemistry.</p>

emerged with the scientific revolution as creators of scientific

During the Enlightenment, some societies established or maintained

universities from scientific societies by arguing that the

science began to decline, learned societies became the cornerstone of
organised science. Formal scientific societies were established by
the state to provide technical expertise. Most societies were allowed
to control their own publications, to supervise the selection of new
members and to oversee their administration. After 1700, a huge
number of official academies and societies were established in

a paradigm shift from the old feudalism paradigm of government known
as &quot;the divine right of kings&quot;. According to this view, the
revolutions of the late 17th and early 19th centuries were due to the
fact that this <font color="#556b2f">paradigm shift </font>could
often not be resolved peacefully, resulting in violent revolution.
The philosophy of government, in which the king was never wrong, was
clearly in direct contradiction to the philosophy that citizens were

thought was largely dominated by social contract theorists, both

critical of this camp. Hume's essay Of the Original Contract argues
that consent-led governments are rarely seen and that civil
government is based on the customary authority and power of the
ruler. It is precisely because the ruler has authority over and
against the subject that the subject tacitly consents; Hume says that
the subject &quot;never imagined that his consent would make him
sovereign&quot;, rather the authority did. Similarly, Ferguson did
not believe that citizens build the state, but that states emerge as
a result of social development. In <font color="#2f4f4f">An1767 Essay

the radical confrontation between the monarchy and the Enlightenment
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">literati </font><font color="#a9a9a9">in
the 17th century</font>. These writers constituted a kind of
'substitute aristocracy, both omnipotent and devoid of real power'.
This apparent power came from <font color="#2f4f4f">the rise of
'public opinion', which </font>arose when absolutist centralisation
removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political scene.
The &quot;literary politics&quot; that emerged promoted a discourse
of equality and was thus fundamentally at odds with monarchical rule.
De Tocqueville &quot;clearly identifies ... the cultural effects of
the change in the forms of exercise of power&quot;. However, it took
another century before the cultural approach became central to
historiography, as in Robert Darnton's The Business of Enlightenment:

in the era itself with what the Enlightenment figures had to say
about their work. The dominant element was the intellectual
perspective they adopted. D'Alembert's Preliminary Discourse of
l'Encyclopédie presents a history of the Enlightenment, which
includes a chronological list of developments in the field of
knowledge, culminating in the encyclopaedia. In 1783, the Jewish
philosopher <font color="#a9a9a9">Moses Mendelssohn spoke of </font>the
Enlightenment as the process by which man was trained to use reason.
<font color="#dcdcdc">Immanuel Kant </font>called the Enlightenment
<font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;the liberation of man from self-imposed
tutelage&quot;, where </font>tutelage means &quot;the inability of
man to use his reason without the guidance of another&quot;. &quot;For
Kant, the Enlightenment was the final coming of age of humanity, the
liberation of human consciousness from a state of immature
ignorance.&quot; The German scholar Ernst Cassirer called the
Enlightenment &quot;part and specific stage in the whole intellectual
development through which modern philosophical thought acquired its
characteristic self-confidence and self-consciousness&quot;.

publishing houses were conveniently located outside France to avoid
France's overzealous censorship. They smuggled their products across
the border, where they were transported to secret booksellers or
small traders. The accounts of clandestine booksellers may give a
better picture of what literate French people might actually have
read, as their secretive nature offered less restrictive product
ranges. In one case, political books were the most popular category
of books, mainly libel and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in
sensationalist stories <font color="#2f4f4f">about criminals and

Many Masonic values seemed to draw heavily on Enlightenment values
and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Masonic ideals and
the Enlightenment in D'Alembert's Dream, where he explores
Freemasonry as a means of spreading Enlightenment beliefs. Historian
Margaret Jacob highlights the importance of Freemasonry as an

thought. </font>On the negative side, Daniel Roche disputes claims
that Freemasonry promoted <font color="#556b2f">equality.</font> He
argues that lodges attracted only men of similar social backgrounds.
The presence of <font color="#6b8e23">noblewomen </font>in the French
'adoptive lodges' formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close
ties between these lodges and aristocratic society.</p>

also prefer an <font color="#a9a9a9">alphabetical </font>ordering
model rather than the cumbersome works arranged thematically.
Commenting on alphabetical order, historian <font color="#dcdcdc">Charles
Porset </font>has said that &quot;as the zero degree of taxonomy,
alphabetical order mandates all reading strategies; in this respect
it can be considered a hallmark of the Enlightenment&quot;. For
Porset, the avoidance of thematic and hierarchical systems thus
allows free interpretation of works and becomes an example of
egalitarianism. Encyclopaedias and dictionaries also became common in
the Age of Reason, as the <font color="#2f4f4f">number of educated
consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply</font>. The
number of dictionaries and encyclopaedias published in the second

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">One of the most important advances
the Enlightenment era brought to science was its popularisation. An
increasingly literate population, seeking information and education
in both the arts and sciences, contributed to the spread of the
printing press culture and the dissemination of scientific knowledge.
The new literate population was driven by <font color="#a9a9a9">a
surge in the availability of food. </font>This enabled many people to
rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had
money <font color="#dcdcdc">for education. </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Popular
education </font>was generally part of the general Enlightenment
ideal of 'making knowledge available to as many people as possible'.
As public interest in natural philosophy grew in the 1700s, public
lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new
avenues to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who were
excluded from universities and academies. More formal works provided
explanations of scientific theories for people who lacked the
educational background to understand the original scientific text.

grew in popularity and entered millions of American homes, some small
video rental stores began buying their own copies of NES games and

cassette rentals for a few days. Nintendo made no profit from this

rentals, a newly released game could appear on store shelves and be

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In <font color="#a9a9a9">1986</font>,
Nintendo released the Famicom Disk System (FDS) in Japan, a disk
drive that uses a single-sided, proprietary 5 cm (2 inch) disk and
plugs into a cassette slot. It contains RAM to load the game and an
additional single-cycle wavetable lookup audio chip. Originally,
floppy disks were available <font color="#dcdcdc">at kiosks in
shopping malls </font>and other public places, where <font color="#2f4f4f">shoppers
could select a game and write it to a floppy disk.</font> This
process cost less than buying a cassette, and users could take the
disk back to the kiosk to have a new game written on it. The floppy
disks were used both <font color="#556b2f">to record the game and to
record progress, and had </font>a total capacity of <font color="#6b8e23">128
kilobytes </font>(64 kilobytes per side).</p>

predicted that competition from technologically superior systems such
as <font color="#a9a9a9">Sega's 16-bit Mega Drive/Genesis </font>would
spell the imminent end of the NES's dominance. In contrast, during
the first year of Nintendo's successor console, the Super Famicom
(known outside Japan as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System), the
Famicom remained Japan's second best-selling video game console,
beating by far the newer and more powerful NEC PC Engine and Sega
Mega Drive. The console remained popular in Japan and North America
until the <font color="#dcdcdc">end of 1993</font>, when demand for
new NES software plummeted. The last Famicom game released in Japan
is Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima IV (Adventure Island IV), while in
North America <font color="#2f4f4f">Wario's Woods </font>is the last
licensed game. Due to declining sales and a lack of new software
games, Nintendo of America officially discontinued the NES by 1995,
but Nintendo continued to manufacture new Famicom units in Japan
until 25 September 2003 and continued to repair Famicom consoles
until <font color="#6b8e23">31 October 2007, </font>citing a lack of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Problems with the 10NES lock chip
often led to the console's most notorious problem: <font color="#a9a9a9">a
flashing red power indicator light</font>, where the system appears
to repeatedly start and shut down as the 10NES reset the console <font color="#dcdcdc">once
per second</font>. The lock chip required constant communication with
the in-game chip to function. <font color="#2f4f4f">Dirty, outdated
and warped connectors </font>often interfered with communication,
resulting in flashing. Alternatively, the console would turn on but
only display a white, grey or green screen. Users tried to solve this
problem <font color="#556b2f">by blowing air into the cartridge
connectors</font>, inserting the cartridge just far enough to lower
the ZIF connector, licking the edge connector, hitting the side of
the system after inserting the cartridge, moving the cartridge from
side to side after inserting it, pushing the ZIF connector up and
down repeatedly, holding the ZIF connector lower than it should have
been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. These attempts at
solutions often became significant in their own right and are often
remembered alongside the NES. Many of the more common attempts to fix
this problem instead risked damaging the cartridge and/or the
system.In 1989, Nintendo released the official NES Cleaning Kit,
which helped users clean defective cartridges and consoles.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Nintendo released several games <font color="#a9a9a9">for
the FDS </font>(including Super Mario Bros., which had already been
released on cartridge) and third-party companies such as Konami and
Taito released several games. A few unlicensed games were also made.
However, the limitations of the FDS quickly became apparent with the
introduction of larger ROM chips that allowed the use of cartridges
larger than 128 kilobytes. More advanced memory management chips
(MMCs) soon appeared and the FDS quickly became obsolete. Nintendo
also charged developers substantial sums of money to produce <font color="#dcdcdc">FDS
games</font>, and many refused to develop for it and continued to
<font color="#2f4f4f">make cartridge games instead. </font>Many FDSs
do not have <font color="#556b2f">dust covers </font>(except for some
unlicensed and bootleg versions) and are easily prone to becoming
dirty. In addition, the drive uses <font color="#6b8e23">a belt </font>that
breaks frequently and requires invasive replacement. After only two
years, the production of FDSs was discontinued, although the booths
remained until 1993, and Nintendo continued to service, rewrite and

Nintendo amended the terms of its publisher license agreements to
remove the two-year rule and other restrictive terms. Nintendo and
the FTC settled the case in April 1991, requiring Nintendo to mail
coupons giving a <font color="#a0522d">$5 </font>discount on a new
game to every person who had purchased an NES game between June 1988
and December 1990. GameSpy pointed out that the penalty Nintendo

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Famicom had no <font color="#a9a9a9">locking
device, which is why </font>unlicensed cassettes (both legal and
smuggled) were very common in Japan and the Far East. The original
NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) had a 10NES locking chip, which
greatly increased the challenges for unlicensed developers. In later
years, home-based hobbyists discovered that by disassembling the NES
and cutting the fourth pin of the lock chip, the chip's mode of
operation changed from &quot;lock&quot; to &quot;key&quot;, removing
all effects and greatly improving the console's ability to play
legitimate games as well as bootleg games and modified imported
games. NES consoles sold in different regions had different locking
chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles in
another region. Known regions include the United States/Canada
(&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">3193lockout </font>chip&quot;), most of
Europe (<font color="#556b2f">3195</font>), Asia (<font color="#6b8e23">3196</font>)
and the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia (<font color="#a0522d">3197</font>).
Because Europe used two different lockout chips, European NES game
boxes often had an A or B on the front to indicate whether the game
was compatible with UK, Italian and Australian consoles (A) or with
the rest of Europe (B). For games played in the rest of Europe, the
packaging usually bore the text &quot;This game is not compatible
with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment
System&quot;. Similarly, games in the UK, Italy and Australia were
labelled &quot;This game is only compatible with Mattel or NES
versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System&quot;.</p>

console. <font color="#a9a9a9">Masayuki Uemura </font>designed the

</font>system that would function as a full-fledged computer with a
keyboard and floppy drive, but Nintendo CEO <font color="#556b2f">Hiroshi
Yamauchi </font>abandoned this plan, opting instead for a cheaper,
more conventional cartridge-based games console, as he felt features
such as a keyboard and floppy drive were intimidating to
non-technology enthusiasts. <font color="#6b8e23">In October </font>1982,
a test model was built to verify the functionality of the hardware,
after which work began on the programming tools. As 65xx CPUs had not
been manufactured or sold in Japan by then, no cross-development
software was available and had to be produced from scratch. Early
Famicom games were written on a system running <font color="#a0522d">on
the NEC PC-8001</font>, and graphics were designed using on-screen
LED lights with a digitizer, as no dedicated software design tools

</font>(equivalent to <font color="#2f4f4f">$475 </font>in 2016),
included the R.O.B., a light gun called the NES Zapper, two
controllers, and two Game Pak packs: the Gyromite and the Duck Hunt.
The base set, which retailed for $89.99 without the game and <font color="#6b8e23">$99.99
</font>with Super Mario Bros. The Action Set, retailing in 1988 at
US$ 149.99, included a Control Deck, two game controllers, an NES
Zapper and two Game Pak game packs containing both Super Mario Bros.
and <font color="#a0522d">Duck Hunt. </font>In 1989, the Power Set
included the console, two game controllers, NES Zapper, Power Pad and
a triple Game Pak that included Super Mario Bros, <font color="#228b22">Duck
Hunt </font>and World Class Track Meet. In 1990, the Sports Set was
released, which included a console, a wireless NES Satellite infrared
multi-pad adapter, four game controllers and a dual game pack that
included Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Two more bundles
were later released, using the original NES console. The 1992
Challenge Set included the console, two controllers and the Super
Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak for a retail price of $89.99. The Basic Set,
first released in 1987, was repackaged for a retail price of <font color="#8b0000">$89.99.</font>
It included only the console and two controllers, and no longer
included a cartridge. Instead, it included a book called the Official
Nintendo Player's Guide, which contained detailed information on all
NES games made up to that point.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The NES was released after the
&quot;video game crash&quot; of the early 1980s, when many retailers
and adults had considered electronic games to be a passing fad, and
many initially believed that the NES was just another fad. Before the
NES/Famicom, Nintendo was known as a reasonably successful Japanese
toy and game card manufacturer, and the popularity of the NES/Famicom
helped Nintendo grow into an internationally recognised name that was
almost synonymous with video games, as <font color="#dcdcdc">Atari
</font>had been in the 2600s, and laid the foundations for Japanese
dominance in the video game industry. With the NES, Nintendo also
changed the relationship between console manufacturers and
third-party software developers by restricting software developers
from publishing and distributing software without <font color="#2f4f4f">a
licence. </font>This led to <font color="#556b2f">higher quality
</font>software products, which helped to change the attitude of the
public, who were fed up with the poorly produced products of other

</font>1993, the Famicom received a similar overhaul. It, too, loaded
cartridges through a hidden slot in the top of the machine and used
wireless controllers. Because the <font color="#dcdcdc">HVC-101 </font>used
a composite video output instead of a simple RF output like the

microphones like the second controller on the original console,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">To distinguish its new home platform
from the general perception of the problematic and superficial video
game market of the early 1980s, Nintendo reformed its brand
nomenclature and positioning, and introduced a strict product
approval and licensing policy. The entire system was called the
'<font color="#a9a9a9">Entertainment System' </font>rather than the
'Video Game System', and at its heart was a device called the
'<font color="#dcdcdc">Control Deck</font>' rather than the 'console'
and software cartridges called '<font color="#2f4f4f">Game Paks</font>'
rather than 'video games'. The 10NES lock chip system acted as a lock
and key for each <font color="#556b2f">Game Pak </font>and Control
Deck, preventing the copying or manufacture of NES games that had not
been approved by Nintendo under licence. The release packs of the NES
games contained images that very closely represented the actual
screen graphics of the game, which were of a sufficiently
recognisable quality as such. In order to avoid confusion for
consumers, the symbols on the packaging of the release games clearly
indicated the genre of the game. A &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">quality
label</font>&quot; was printed on all duly licensed game and
accessory packaging. The original seal read: 'This seal is a
statement that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of
this product'. The text was later changed to &quot;<font color="#a0522d">Official

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Nintendo was not as restrictive as
Sega, which did not allow third-party publishing until <font color="#a9a9a9">Mediagenic
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">in late summer 1988</font>. Nintendo's
intention, however, was to reserve a large part of the revenues from
NES games for itself. Nintendo required that it was the sole
manufacturer of all cartridges and that the publisher had to pay the
full amount before <font color="#2f4f4f">the cartridges </font>for
that game could be manufactured. The <font color="#556b2f">cartridges
</font>could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers took all the
<font color="#6b8e23">risk.</font> As a result, some publishers lost
more money on the rush sale of the remaining inventory at the end of
the NES season than they ever made in profits on game sales. Because
Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to
apply strict rules to third-party developers, who had to sign a
contract with Nintendo obliging them to develop exclusively for the
system, to order at least 10 000 cartridges and to make only five
games a year. The lack of DRAM and ROM chips in 1988 was also said to
have caused Nintendo to accept only 25 % of cartridge requests from
publishers. This was an average figure, as some publishers received
much larger quantities and others received almost nothing. GameSpy
noted that Nintendo's &quot;ironclad terms&quot; made the company
many enemies in the 1980s. Some developers tried to get around the
five-game limit by creating additional corporate brands, such as
Konami's Ultra Games brand; others tried to get around the 10NES
circuit.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When Nintendo launched the NES in
the US, its design was deliberately different from that of other game
consoles. Nintendo wanted to differentiate its product from those of
its competitors and avoid the generally poor reputation that game
consoles had acquired after the 1983 video game crash. One result of
this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a
front-loading ZIF (Zero <font color="#a9a9a9">Insertion Force)
</font>cartridge slot<font color="#a9a9a9">, </font>designed to
resemble the front-loading mechanism of <font color="#dcdcdc">a video
recorder</font>. The new connector worked quite well when both the
connector and cartridges were clean and the connector pins were new.
Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not really zero pin force. When
the user inserted the cartridge into the NES, pushing the cartridge
down and into place <font color="#2f4f4f">bent the contact pins
slightly and </font>pushed the cartridge ROM back into the cartridge.
The frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to
wear out over years of repeated use, and the ZIF design proved to be
more susceptible to dirt and dust than the industry standard card
edge connector. Nintendo's choice of materials did not mitigate these
design problems; the springs on the nickel connector on the console
slot wore out by design, and the copper connectors on the cartridges
were also prone to fading. Many gamers tried to fix the corrosion
problems by blowing into the cartridges and then putting them back in
place, which actually damaged the copper connectors by accelerating
their fading.</p>

failures, &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Nintendo Authorized Repair
Centers</font>&quot; were established across the United States.
According to Nintendo, the purpose of the Authorised Repair Centres
programme was to <font color="#dcdcdc">ensure that machines were
repaired properly.</font> Nintendo supplied the necessary spare parts
only to the shops enrolled in the Authorised Repairer Programme. In
practice, the authorisation process meant nothing more than paying
Nintendo a <font color="#2f4f4f">fee </font>for this privilege. In
line with the recent trend, many websites have started to offer
Nintendo repair parts, guides and services, replacing the services
previously offered by authorised repair centres.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Athanasius says he was a disciple,
as well as trained by the Great (tenth) Martyrs, and the last
persecution of Christianity by pagan <font color="#a9a9a9">Rome </font>This
persecution was most severe <font color="#2f4f4f">in the East</font>,
especially in Egypt and Palestine. <font color="#556b2f">Peter of
Alexandria, the </font>17th Archbishop of Alexandria, suffered
martyrdom in the last days of that persecution311 and may have been
one of these teachers. His successor Alexander Alexander Alexander
Alexander (312-328) was a follower of Origen and a documented mentor
of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander &quot;invited
Athanasius to his comments and to be his secretary. He was well
educated in grammar and rhetoric, and even as a young man and before
he had become a bishop, he had given testimony of his wisdom and
sagacity to those who lived with him'. Athanasius' earliest work
Against the Heathen - On the Incarnation (written before319 ) has
traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeated <font color="#191970">quotations
from Plato </font>and the use of Aristotle's definition of Organon),
but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the
theories of the various philosophical schools and, in particular,
with the development of Neo-Platonism. Ultimately, Athanasius shaped
the philosophical thought of the Alexandrian school away from
Origenist principles, such as the 'fully allegorical interpretation
of the text'. Yet in his later works Athanasius quotes <font color="#8b0000">Homer
</font>more than once (Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29). In a letter to
the Emperor Constantius, he presents a defence of himself which bears
clear traces of the study of Demosthenes de Corona.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Around319 , when Athanasius was a
deacon, a presbyter named Arius came into direct conflict with
Alexander <font color="#dcdcdc">of Alexandria</font>. It seems that
Arius rebuked Alexander for what he considered to be misleading or
heretical doctrines taught by the bishop. Arius' theological views
seem to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity, and his
Christological views were certainly not radical. He adopted a
subordinationist Christology, according to which Christ was the
divine <font color="#2f4f4f">Son of God (Logos), created, not born,
which was </font>strongly influenced by Alexandrian thinkers such as
Origen, and which was a <font color="#556b2f">common Christological
view </font><font color="#6b8e23">in Alexandria </font>at the time.
The support of <font color="#a0522d">influential bishops </font>such

illustrates how other Christians in the empire shared Arius'
subordinate Christology. <font color="#191970">Alexander </font>subsequently

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Athanasius's episcopate began on 9
May 328, when the Council of Alexandria elected Athanasius to succeed
the elderly <font color="#a9a9a9">Alexander</font>. This Council also
condemned various heresies and schisms, many of which continued
during his 45-year episcopate (c. 8 June 328 - 2 May 373). Patriarch
Athanasius spent more than 17 years <font color="#dcdcdc">in five
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">exiles </font>ordered by four different
Roman emperors, apart from about six other cases in which Athanasius
fled Alexandria to escape people who were trying to take his life.
Hence the expression 'Athanasius contra mundum', or 'Athanasius
against the world'. During his first years as bishop, however,
Athanasius visited the churches in his region, which at the time
included all of <font color="#556b2f">Egypt and Libya.</font> He
established contacts with hermits and monks in the desert, such as
Pachomius, which proved very valuable to him over the years. Soon
afterwards, Athanasius became involved in the theological <font color="#6b8e23">disputes
against the </font><font color="#a0522d">Arians</font> in the
Byzantine Empire, which consumed much of his life.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By early 343 Athanasius had
travelled via Rome from Alexandria, North Africa, to Gaul, now
<font color="#dcdcdc">Belgium/Dutch and the surrounding areas, </font>where
<font color="#2f4f4f">Hosius of Cordoba </font>was bishop, a great
defender of orthodoxy in the West. Together they went to Sardica.
There, a full church assembly was convened/convened, respecting the
wishes of the Roman Pontiff. The journey was a mammoth task in
itself. At this great meeting of the prelates, the leaders of the
Church, the case of Athanasius was once again raised, i.e. Athanasius
was formally questioned <font color="#556b2f">for offences </font><font color="#6b8e23">and
even murder </font>(a man named Arsenius and the use of his body for
magic - an absurd accusation.) [The Council was convened to
investigate the accusations against Athanasius and the other bishops,
for which they had been dismissed from their offices by the
semi-Arian Synod of Antioch (341) and had gone into exile. According
to Socrates (E. H. ii. 20) it was convened by two emperors, Constans
and Constantius, but according to Baronius by Pope Julius (337-352)
(Ad an. 343). One hundred and seventy-six were present. The Eusebian
bishops opposed the admission of Athanasius and the other deposed
bishops to the council, except to answer the charges against them.
The <font color="#a0522d">orthodox bishops, </font>numbering about
one hundred, <font color="#a0522d">overruled </font>their <font color="#a0522d">objections,
and were in </font>the majority. Seeing that they had no chance of
getting their views accepted, the Eusebians withdrew to
Philippopolis, Philippopolis (Thrace), in Thrace, where they held an
opposition meeting under the leadership of the Patriarch of Antioch,
and confirmed the decisions of the Synod of Antioch ]. At the Council
of Sardica <font color="#228b22">his innocence was once again
confirmed</font>. Two conciliar letters were drawn up, one to the
clergy and faithful of Alexandria and the other to the bishops of
Egypt and Libya, making known the will of the Council. In the
meantime the Eusebians had gone to Philippopolis, where they issued
anathemas against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution
against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and
Constantius was moved to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius
and the priests loyal to him. Orders were given that if the saint
attempted to return to his seat, he was to be executed. <font color="#191970">Athanasius
</font>retreated from Sardica to Naissus in Mysias, where he
celebrated Easter in 344. Hosius presided over the Council of
Sardica, just as he presided over the First Council of Nicaea, which,
like the Synod of 341, found Athanasius not guilty. &amp;. He spent
his last Easter feast in exile in Aquileia in April 345, received by
Bishop Fortunatianus.</p>

This was followed in 356 by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during <font color="#556b2f">a

During this period Athanasius completed his <font color="#a0522d">Four

behaviour in Apologia to Constantius and Apologia to his flight.
Constantius' persistent opposition to Athanasius and reports of
persecution of non-Aryans by the new Arian bishop George of Laodicea
led Athanasius to write a more emotional <font color="#228b22">History

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">T. Gilmartin (Professor of History,
Maynooth, 1890) writes in Church History, Part 1, Chapter XVII: The
Arians sought the approval of the Ecumenical Council. They sought to
hold two councils. Constantine summoned the Eastern bishops to
Seleucia in Isuria and the Western bishops to <font color="#a9a9a9">Rimini
in Italy. The </font>Arians held a preliminary conference in Sirmium
<font color="#dcdcdc">to agree on </font><font color="#2f4f4f">a
formula of faith</font>. The &quot;Homoeon&quot; creed was adopted,
proclaiming the <font color="#556b2f">Son to be &quot;like the
Father</font><font color="#6b8e23">&quot;.</font> They met in the
autumn of 359. In Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of whom
one hundred and fifty were half-Aryans. The half-Aryans refused to
accept anything but the &quot;Homoiousion&quot;, (see: Homoiousian),
a formulation of the faith. The imperial prefecture was forced to
dissolve without agreeing on any creed. The leader of the
&quot;Homoionian&quot; party, Acacius, travelled to Constantinople,
where the &quot;Homoionian Synod&quot; (composed of those bishops who
happened to be present at the court at the time) approved the Sirmian
formulation of the faith, and an order of deposition was issued
against the leaders of the semiarians. There were over four hundred
in Rimini, eighty of whom were <font color="#a0522d">Arians</font>,
the rest orthodox. The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed
other than <font color="#191970">the Nicene, while the </font>others
were equally in favour of the Sirmian. Both sides sent a delegation
to the emperor, who declared that no agreement was likely to be
reached and asked the bishops to return to their dioceses. In order
to subdue the orthodox bishops (according to Sulpitius Severius),
Constantius delayed his response for several months and finally
persuaded them to accept the Syriac creed. After this council Jerome
said: &quot; ... the whole world groaned with astonishment at
discovering that they were <font color="#8b0000">Arian. </font>&quot;</p>

work to restore the somewhat shattered success of the Orthodox party
and to clear the theological climate of uncertainty. To clear up the
misunderstandings that had arisen in previous years, an attempt was
made to clarify the meaning of the Nicaean formulas still further.

Pythicodorus Trico, who, although described in the Chronicon

death, Gregory of Nazianzus called him &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">the

appreciated by all the Church Fathers who followed him, both in the
West and in the East, who noted their rich devotion to the Word made
man, their great pastoral concern and their deep interest in the
monastic community. Athanasius is considered by the Roman Catholic
Church to be one of the four great teachers of the Church in the
East. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, he is called the &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Father

believe in Christ and not to persecute the Church of God. An attempt
was made to leave the gifts with the church, but Liberius threw them

proved to be slanderers (see 'slander') and impostors, and that it
was unjust to condemn a person who could not legally be convicted of
any crime. The emperor was silent on each point, but when his
patience ran out he ordered him to be deported. Liberius went into
exile. Two years later, Constantius went to Rome to celebrate the
twentieth anniversary of his reign. The women joined him in his
appeal for the return of Liberius. He agreed on condition that he
obeyed the <font color="#191970">orders of the bishops present at the

confession or creed drawn up by the Arians in Sirmium. As soon as he
had recovered his seat, he declared his support for the Nicene Creed,
as Theodoret testifies (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The
emperor knew what he wanted the people to believe. So did the bishops
of his court. Athanasius held to the orthodox creed. Constantine was

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">T. Gilmartin, (Professor of History,
Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: &quot;By
order of Constantius, the only ruler of the Roman Empire, after the
death of his brother Constans, a council was held at Arles in 353,
presided over by Vincent Liberius, Bishop of Capua, in the name of
<font color="#a9a9a9">Pope </font>Liberius. The Fathers, horrified by
the <font color="#dcdcdc">threats of the emperor</font>, a sworn
Arian, agreed to condemn Athanasius. <font color="#2f4f4f">The Pope
refused to accept </font>their decision and asked the Emperor to
convene a second council to examine Athanasius' charges freely. To
this <font color="#556b2f">Constantius </font><font color="#6b8e23">agreed</font>,
as he felt he could supervise it, in Milan<font color="#6b8e23">.</font>
Milan was chosen as the place, and in 355 three hundred bishops, most
from the west, only a few from the east, met there. They met in a
church in Milan. Soon the emperor ordered them into the hall of the
imperial palace, which put an end to all free discussion. He
presented the <font color="#a0522d">Arian </font><font color="#228b22">creed
for </font>their approval. Those who refused were threatened with
banishment and death. All, except Dionysius (Bishop of Milan) and the
two papal legates, Eusebius of Vercell and Lucifer of Cagliari,
agreed to the Arian creed and to Athanasius' condemnation. Those who
refused were <font color="#191970">sent into exile</font>. The
decrees were submitted to the Pope for approval, but were rejected
because of violence against the bishops.</p>

Athanasius appealed for unity among all believers in Christianity,
even if they disagreed on terminological issues. This prepared the
ground for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity.
However, the Council also opposed those who denied the divinity of
the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ and the deity of Christ.
For those heretical bishops who repented, lenient measures were
agreed, but <font color="#6b8e23">severe penance </font>was imposed

Mass, the Eucharist, the Gospel of John[1:1-14], together with the
prayer; &quot;Placeat tibi&quot;, the blessing, are all private
devotions, gradually merged into liturgical worship. The beginning of
the Gospel of John was much used as a special devotion throughout the
Middle Ages. Nevertheless, recitation <font color="#228b22">at the
altar </font>became more common; eventually Pius V made this practice
general in the Roman Rite in his edition of the Missal (1570). It

to Henry Yesler's sawmill. The subsequent deterioration of the area
may be a possible origin of the term, which later entered the wider

much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between

<font color="#556b2f">the anti-Chinese riots of </font>1885-1886. The
violence was sparked by white unemployed workers determined to drive
the Chinese out of Seattle (there were also anti-Chinese riots in

Few of these workers found lasting wealth, however; Seattle's
business of providing miners with clothing and salmon paid off in the
long run. Along with Seattle, other towns in the Puget Sound region,
such as Everett, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton and Olympia, became
competitors for the exchange of precious metals, rather than sites
for the extraction of precious metals. The boom lasted well into the
early 1900s, funding many new Seattle businesses and products. In
1907, 19-year-old James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and
founded the <font color="#6b8e23">American Messenger Company </font>(later
