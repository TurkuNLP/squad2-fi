competence of <font color="#6b8e23">the federal government </font>(i.e.
the federation), while others are the joint competence of the Länder
and the federal government; the Länder retain legislative power in
all other areas, including '<font color="#a0522d">culture</font>',
which in Germany includes <font color="#228b22">not only the economic
promotion of art and science, but also most forms of education and
vocational training. </font>Although international relations,
including international agreements, are primarily a matter for the
federal level, the Länder have certain limited powers in this area:
the Länder defend their interests at federal level through the
<font color="#8b0000">Bundesrat </font>(upper house of the German
Bundestag) in matters which concern them directly, and have limited
powers to conclude <font color="#483d8b">international agreements

Bavaria (since 1919), the Land of Saxony (originally since 1919 and

as a result of this war, Prussia remained dominant in Germany, and

Germany. The new German Empire consisted of 25 states (three of which
were <font color="#483d8b">Hanseatic cities</font>) and the imperial
territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The Empire was ruled by Prussia, which
controlled <font color="#3cb371">65% of </font>the territory and <font color="#bc8f8f">62%
of </font>the population. The remaining states after the territorial
annexations of the Treaty of Versailles continued as republics of the
new Federal Republic of Germany. These states were gradually de facto
abolished and, under the Nazi regime, were reduced to provinces
through the Gleichschaltung process, as the Nazi Gau system largely
replaced the states administratively.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many applications of silicate glass
are based on its optical <font color="#a9a9a9">transparency, which is
why the </font>most important application for silicate glass is
window glass. Glass transmits, reflects and refracts light; these
properties can be improved by cutting and polishing to produce
optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware and <font color="#dcdcdc">optical
fibres </font>for high-speed light transmission. Glass can be
coloured by adding <font color="#2f4f4f">metallic salts </font><font color="#556b2f">and
</font>can also be painted and printed with glass paints. These
properties have led to the widespread use of glass in the manufacture
of works of art, particularly stained glass. Although fragile,
silicate glass is highly durable, and many examples of broken glass
survive from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be shaped
or moulded into any shape and because it is a sterile product, it has
traditionally been used to make vessels such as bowls, vases,
bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most massive forms it has
also been used for paperweights, marbles and beads. When glass fibre
is compressed into extruded glass fibre and matted into glass wool so
that it binds air, it becomes <font color="#6b8e23">a thermal
insulation material, </font>and when these glass fibres are embedded
in <font color="#a0522d">an organic polymeric plastic</font>, they
are the key structural reinforcing component of a glass fibre
composite. Some objects have historically been so commonly made of
silicate glass that they are simply referred to by the material's
name, such as drinking and reading glasses.</p>

bath in which molten glass flows unimpeded by gravity. The upper
surface of the glass is treated under <font color="#556b2f">nitrogen
</font>pressure to create a polished surface. The container glass for
ordinary bottles and cans is shaped by blowing and pressing. This
glass is often slightly chemically modified (by adding <font color="#6b8e23">alumina

oldest types of glass are &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">silicate
glasses&quot;, </font>based on the chemical compound <font color="#dcdcdc">silica
</font>(silicon dioxide or quartz), which is the main constituent of
sand. In common parlance, the term glass is often used to refer only
to this type of material, which is familiar from the material used in
window glass and glass bottles. Of the many types of silica-based
glass, the common glazing and storage glass consists of a special
<font color="#2f4f4f">type of glass </font>called <font color="#2f4f4f">soda-lime
glass</font>, which is composed of approximately 75 % silica (SiO2),
sodium oxide (Na2O) derived from sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium
oxide, also called lime (CaO), and a number of minor additives. <font color="#556b2f">Pure
silica </font>can be used to produce very clear and durable quartz
glass, but quartz's high melting point and very narrow glass
transition make glass blowing and heat treatment difficult. In
glasses such as soda-lime, compounds added to quartz are used to
lower the melting temperature and improve workability, but at the
expense of toughness, heat resistance and optical transmittance.</p>

in the same way as a polycrystalline material. The surface of glass
is often smooth because the molecules of the supercooled liquid

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Glass was widely used in the Middle
Ages. Anglo-Saxon glass has been found in archaeological excavations
throughout England, both in settlements and cemeteries. In the
Anglo-Saxon period, glass was used to make many objects, such as
vessels, beads and windows, and was also used in jewellery. From the
<font color="#a9a9a9">10th century </font>onwards<font color="#a9a9a9">,</font>
glass was used for stained glass in churches and cathedrals, the most
famous examples being Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint
Denis. From the 13th century onwards, architects designed buildings
with stained glass walls, such as the <font color="#dcdcdc">Sainte-Chapelle
</font>in Paris (1203-1248) and the east end of Gloucester Cathedral.
Stained glass revived in the <font color="#2f4f4f">19th century </font>with
the architecture of the Gothic Revival movement. With the <font color="#556b2f">Renaissance
</font>and the change in architectural style, the use of large
stained glass windows declined. The use of stained glass in domestic
buildings increased until most notable houses had stained glass
windows. Initially they were small sheets of glass, leaded together,
but as technology improved, glass could be produced relatively
cheaply in ever larger sheets. This led to larger window panes, and
by the 20th century much <font color="#6b8e23">larger windows </font>were
used in ordinary residential and commercial buildings.</p>

ions </font>are small and mobile, and their presence in glass allows
a certain degree of electrical conductivity, especially in the molten

chemical resistance of the glass, allows water to leach out and
facilitates corrosion. Alkaline earth metal ions, which have two
positive charges and need two oxygen ions, which are not bridges, to
compensate for their charge, are themselves much less mobile and also
prevent diffusion of other ions, especially bases. The most common

new processing techniques can initially be studied in small-scale
laboratory experiments. The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass
melts are often different from those used for mass production, due to
the <font color="#a9a9a9">low cost factor</font>. In the laboratory,
mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken to ensure that the
raw materials are not reacted with moisture or other chemicals
present in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal
oxides and hydroxides or boric oxide) or that the impurities are
quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass
melting should be taken into account in the choice of raw materials,
e.g. <font color="#dcdcdc">sodium selenite </font>may be preferred to
the more volatile SeO2. Also, more reactive raw materials may be
preferred over relatively inert raw materials, such as Al(OH)3 over

not perfectly flat, but the edges of the sheet became different

changed their relative mass by several tens of parts per million, no

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Some second-generation renewables,
such as wind power, have great potential and already have relatively
low production costs. Global wind installations increased by <font color="#a9a9a9">35
800 </font><font color="#dcdcdc">MW in </font>2010, bringing total
installed capacity to 194 400 MW, up 22.5% from 158 700 MW at the end
of 2009. The 2010 increase represents a total investment of €47.3
billion (USD 65 billion) and for the first time more than half of all
new wind power was added outside the traditional markets of Europe
and North America. This is mainly due to the continued rise of China,
which accounted for almost half of all installations (16,500 MW),
with <font color="#2f4f4f">42,300 MW of </font>wind power now
installed in China. Wind power accounts for around <font color="#556b2f">19%
of </font>electricity generation in Denmark, <font color="#6b8e23">9%
in </font>Spain and Portugal <font color="#6b8e23">and </font><font color="#a0522d">6%
in </font>Germany and Ireland. In the Australian state of South
Australia, wind power, championed by Prime Minister Mike Rann
(2002-2011), now accounts for 26% of the state's electricity
generation, displacing coal-fired power. At the end of 2011, South
Australia, home to 7.2% of Australia's population, accounted for 54%
of the country's installed wind power capacity. Wind power accounted
for 3.1% of global electricity use at the end of 2014. These are the
largest wind farms in the world:</p>

enclosure </font>was extended. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Via Vittorio
Emanuele </font>was still the main east-west route through the walled
city. The western gate was still Porta Nuova, the circuit continued
to Corso Albert, Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, from where it
turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of
Via Cavour. At this northeast corner was a defensive fort, the
Castello a Mare, which <font color="#556b2f">protected the port of La
Cala. </font>La Cala was closed by <font color="#6b8e23">a huge
chain</font>, one end of which was at S Maria della Catena (St Mary
of the Chain). The <font color="#a0522d">sea wall </font>was on the
west side of the Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the
north side of Via Abramo Lincoln and continues along Corso Tukory.
The wall turns north roughly along Via Benedetto to Palazzo dei
Normanni and back to Porta Nuova. Source: Palermo - a city guide by

which is </font>derived from the same Germanic root as the words
&quot;grass&quot; and &quot;grow&quot;. It is the colour of living
grass and leaves and is therefore most associated with spring, growth

plants use to <font color="#2f4f4f">photosynthesise </font>and

hue themselves <font color="#6b8e23">as a camouflage. </font>Many

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In European and US studies, green is
the colour most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth,
spring, hope and envy. In Europe and the United States, green is
sometimes associated with <font color="#a9a9a9">death </font>(green
has many seemingly opposite associations), illness or the devil, but
in China its association is very positive, being a symbol of
<font color="#dcdcdc">fertility and happiness. </font>In the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance, when the colour of clothes indicated the
social status of the owner, <font color="#2f4f4f">green </font>was
worn by merchants, bankers and nobles, while <font color="#556b2f">red
</font>was the colour of the nobility. Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa
is <font color="#6b8e23">green</font>, indicating that <font color="#a0522d">he
is not from a noble family</font>; the benches in the House of
Commons in Britain are green, while those in the House of Lords are
red. Green is also the traditional colour of safety and permission; a
green light means <font color="#228b22">you can go ahead</font>, and
a green card allows permanent residence in the US. It is the most
important colour <font color="#191970">in Islam. </font>It was the
colour of Muhammad's flag, appears on the flags of almost all Islamic
countries, and represents <font color="#8b0000">the lush vegetation
of paradise.</font> It is also often associated with Gaelic Irish
culture and is the colour of the Irish flag. Because it is <font color="#483d8b">associated
with nature</font>, it is the colour of the environmental movement.
Political groups campaigning for environmental protection and social
justice describe themselves as part of the green movement, and some
call themselves green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in
advertising, with companies selling green or environmentally friendly
products.</p>

described with the same word as blue, &quot;aoi&quot;, because green
is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green varieties of certain

&quot;green&quot; corresponds to about <font color="#a9a9a9">520-570

non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using a term in the

in the range of about 450-530 nm (&quot;blue/green&quot;). <font color="#2f4f4f">530-590

lasers are widely available to the general public in a wide range of
output powers. Green laser pointers with a power of <font color="#dcdcdc">532
nm </font>(563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other
wavelengths of the same power and are very popular due to their good
beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green
lasers use diode pump source technology (DPSS) to produce green
light. An infrared 808 nm laser diode is used to pump neodymium-doped
yttrium vanadium oxide crystal (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium
aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and cause it to emit radiation at 281,76
THz (1064 nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through
another crystal containing <font color="#556b2f">potassium, titanium
and phosphorus (KTP)</font>, whose non-linear properties produce
light at a frequency twice that of the incoming beam (<font color="#6b8e23">563,5
THz</font>), in this case corresponding to a wavelength of 532 nm
('green'). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS
technology <font color="#a0522d">between 501 nm and 543 nm</font>.
Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers such as helium
neon laser (543 nm), argon ion laser (<font color="#228b22">514 nm</font>),
krypton ion laser (<font color="#191970">521 nm and 531 nm</font>)
and liquid <font color="#228b22">dye</font> lasers. Green lasers have
a wide range of applications, including pointing, illumination,
surgery, laser light projection, spectroscopy, interferometry,
fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird

century AD. It produced a </font>blue-green colour that no other
pigment could imitate, but it also had drawbacks: it was unstable, it
was not resistant to moisture, it did not mix well with other
colours, it could <font color="#6b8e23">spoil </font>other colours
with which it came into contact, and it was toxic. In his treatise on
painting, <font color="#a0522d">Leonardo da Vinci </font>warned
artists against using it. It was widely used in miniature paintings
in <font color="#228b22">Europe and Persia </font>in the 1500s and

replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also
called chrome green, is a pigment made from chromium oxide dihydrate,
which was patented in <font color="#191970">1859.</font> It became
popular with painters because, unlike other synthetic greens, it was
stable and non-toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it in combination with

include the Frankland-Duppa reaction in which an oxalate ester

reformazeki reaction, in which α-haloesters and aldehydes are

The most popular was the four-volume <font color="#228b22">Vitruvius

The book contained architectural sketches of famous British buildings

In 1814, a neoclassical colonnade decorated with the British coat of

Slavs, the vernaculars, written languages and literary languages of
the different regions and ethnic groups (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian,
Shtokavian) developed and diverged <font color="#a9a9a9">independently</font>.
Before the 19th century, they were collectively referred to as

&quot;Slavs&quot;, &quot;Bosniaks&quot;, &quot;Dalmatians&quot;,
&quot;Serbs&quot; or &quot;Croats&quot;</font>. The term <font color="#2f4f4f">Serbo-Croat
</font>was first used by <font color="#556b2f">Jacob Grimm </font>in
1824, popularised by the Viennese philologist Jernej Kopitar in the
following decades, and adopted by the Croatian grammarians of Zagreb
in 1854 and 1859. At that time, the Serb and Croat lands were still
part of the Ottoman and Austrian empires. Officially, the language
was variously called Serbo-Croat, Croatian-Serbian, Serb and Croat,
Croat and Serb, Serb or Croat, Croat or Serb. Unofficially, Serbs and
Croats usually called the language <font color="#6b8e23">&quot;Serbian</font>&quot;<font color="#6b8e23">
or &quot;Croat&quot; without </font>distinguishing between the two,
while in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina <font color="#a0522d">&quot;Bosnian&quot;,
&quot;Croat&quot; and &quot;Serbian&quot; </font>were considered the
three names of one official language. In 1988, the Croatian linguist
<font color="#228b22">Dalibor Brozović </font>still advocated the
term Serbo-Croatian, arguing that Serbo-Croatian not only names two
parts of the same language, but, like the Indo-European language,
Serbo-Croatian simply marks the borders of the area where it is
spoken and includes everything in between (&quot;Bosnian&quot; and
&quot;Montenegrin&quot;). Today, the term &quot;Serbo-Croat&quot; is
controversial because of the <font color="#191970">prejudice that
nation and language must correspond.</font> It is still used in the
absence of a succinct alternative, although alternative names have
been used, such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS), which is often
used in political contexts, such as the Hague war crimes tribunal.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the mid-19th century, the Serbs
(led by the self-taught writer and folklorist Vuk Stefanović
Karadžić) and most Croatian writers and linguists (represented by
the Illyrian movement led by Ljudevit Gaj and Đuro Daničić)
proposed that the <font color="#a9a9a9">most common dialect</font>,
the <font color="#dcdcdc">Stokavian dialect, </font>should be used as
the basis for their common standard language. Karadžić standardised
the <font color="#2f4f4f">Serbian Cyrillic alphabet </font>and Gaj
and Daničić the Croatian Latin alphabet <font color="#556b2f">on
the basis of the phonemes of vernacular speech and the principle of
phonological spelling</font>. In 1850, <font color="#6b8e23">Serbian
and Croatian writers and linguists </font>signed the <font color="#a0522d">Vienna
Literary Convention</font>, in which they declared <font color="#228b22">their
intention to create a uniform standard</font>. Thus was born a
complex bivariate language, officially called &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot;
or &quot;Serbian or Croatian&quot; by the Serbs and
&quot;Croatian-Serbian&quot; or &quot;Croatian or Serbian&quot; by
the Croats. In practice, however, the variants of the conceived
common written language functioned as different written variants,
differing mainly in terms of lexical inventory and stylistic devices.
A common expression describing this situation was that Serbo-Croatian
or &quot;Croatian or Serbian&quot; was one language. During the
Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the language

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Western European scholars consider
Yugoslavia's language policy to be <font color="#a9a9a9">exemplary</font>:
although three quarters of the population spoke one language, no
language was official at federal level. Official languages were only
declared official <font color="#dcdcdc">at state and provincial
level, and </font>very generously so: in Vojvodina there were five
languages (including Slovak and Romani, spoken by <font color="#2f4f4f">0.5%
of </font>the population) and in Kosovo four (Albanian, Turkish,
Romani and Serbo-Croat). <font color="#556b2f">Sixteen languages </font>were
used in newspapers, radio and television studios, fourteen as the
language of instruction in schools and nine in universities. Only the
Yugoslav army used Serbo-Croatian as the sole language of command,
and all other languages were represented in the army's other
activities - but this is no different from other armies in
multilingual countries or other specific institutions such as
international air traffic control, where English is used worldwide.
All variants of Serbo-Croat were used <font color="#6b8e23">in the
state administration and in republican and federal institutions</font>.
Both Serbian and Croatian variants were represented in various
grammar books, dictionaries, school textbooks and books known as
<font color="#a0522d">pravopis </font>(with detailed spelling rules).
Serbo-Croatian was a form of soft standardisation. However, legal
equality could not undermine the prestige of the <font color="#228b22">Serbo-Croatian
language</font>: as it was the language used by three quarters of the
population, it served as an informal lingua franca. Within
Serbo-Croatian, the <font color="#191970">Serbian </font>variant,
which had twice as many speakers as Croatian, was more highly valued,
as confirmed by the fact that Slovene and Macedonian speakers
preferred it to Croatian, since their languages are also primitive.
This is a common situation in other multilingual languages, e.g.
German variants differ in prestige, as do Portuguese variants.
Moreover, all languages differ in terms of prestige: 'The fact is
that languages (in terms of prestige, learnability, etc.) are not
equal, and the law cannot make them equal'.</p>

and historical linguistics </font>offers some clues to remembering

they called themselves 'Slovin' and 'Illyrian' (a kind of precursor

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1954, prominent Serbian and
Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, supported by Matica
Srpska and Matica Hrvatska, signed the <font color="#dcdcdc">Novi Sad
Pact, the </font>first conclusion of <font color="#dcdcdc">which
</font>stated that <font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;Serbs, Croats and
Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants, which
have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)&quot;</font>.
The agreement called for <font color="#556b2f">equal status for the
</font><font color="#6b8e23">Cyrillic and Latin scripts and for the
pronunciations of Ecaavian and Ijekavian</font>. The agreement also
specified that <font color="#a0522d">Serbo-Croat </font>should be the
name of the language in official contexts, while the traditional
Serbian and Croatian languages would be retained in informal language
use. <font color="#228b22">Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska </font>jointly
drafted a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian
linguists was asked to draft a pravopis. In the sixties, <font color="#191970">both
books </font>were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in
Zagreb and in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Croatian linguists,
however, claim that this was a Unitarian act. The evidence supporting
this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained
that the Latin alphabet was always used in Belgrade television
broadcasts - which was true, but this was not evidence of unequal
rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić also complained
that the Novi Sad dictionary (1967) listed next to each other the
words of both Croatian and Serbian variants whenever they differed,
which could be taken as evidence of a careful respect for both
variants and not of unitarism. In addition, the Croatian linguists
criticised the parts of the dictionary written by Croatian linguists
for being unitaristic. Finally, the Croatian linguists ignored the
fact that the material in Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian
Philological Society. Despite these facts, in 1967 Croatian
intellectuals issued a declaration on the status and name of the
Croatian written language. On the occasion of the 45th anniversary of
its publication, the Croatian weekly Forum republished the
declaration in 2012 with a critical analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Until 1998</font>,
the network carried a variety of American programming in addition to
its core Canadian programming, in direct competition with Canadian
commercial broadcasters such as <font color="#dcdcdc">CTV and Global</font>.
Since then, it has been limited to <font color="#2f4f4f">Canadian

a few American films and off-network reruns</font>. Since this
change, the CBC has sometimes had difficulty in maintaining audience
levels comparable to those achieved before 1995, although it has
slightly improved its ratings in recent years. In 2007-08, hit series
such as <font color="#6b8e23">Little Mosque on the Prairie and The

CBC's O&amp;O stations operate mostly as a seamless nationwide
service with little deviation from the main channel schedule,
although regional variations do occur from time to time. Most CBC
stations use the CBC brand instead of their call letters as their
broadcast identifier, and only identify themselves once they have
signed on or off (some, like <font color="#2f4f4f">Toronto's CBLT, </font>do
not identify themselves at all, except through PSIP). All CBC O&amp;O
stations have a <font color="#556b2f">standard call letter with the
</font>first two letters <font color="#6b8e23">&quot;CB&quot; </font>(an
ITU prefix not assigned to Canada but to Chile) and the last letter
<font color="#a0522d">&quot;T&quot;.</font> Only the third letter
varies from market to market; however, this letter is generally the
same as the third letter on CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 stations in
the same market. The exceptions to this rule are <font color="#228b22">the
CBC North </font>stations in Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit,
whose call signs begin with the letter 'CF' because they have

The National at 10 p.m. as a core part of CBC programming, but
usually exclude the 11 p.m. rerun (which is no longer broadcast).
Most private affiliates produce their own local newscasts of at least

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">For a century, the <font color="#a9a9a9">Appalachian
Mountains </font>were an obstacle to the westward expansion of the
<font color="#dcdcdc">British colonies</font>. The continuity of the
mountain system, the bewildering variety of its successive ridges,
the sinuous course and ruggedness of its transverse passes, the dense
forest and dense undergrowth kept settlers on the seaward plains and
coastal plains. Only around the <font color="#2f4f4f">Hudson and
Mohawk </font>valleys, Cumberland Gap, the Wachesa Trail [undue
emphasis? - under discussion] and the southern terminus of the system
were there easy routes to the interior, and these were long closed by
powerful Native American tribes such as the <font color="#556b2f">Iroquois,
Creek and Cherokee. </font>Expansion was also hindered by alliances
the British Empire had forged with the <font color="#6b8e23">Indian

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By <font color="#a9a9a9">1755</font>,
the barrier to westward expansion had thus been halved; <font color="#dcdcdc">English
</font>colonial outposts had penetrated the Allegheny and Cumberland
plains, threatening the French monopoly of the intermountain region,
and conflict became inevitable. When a joint battle was fought
against the French to determine control of the Ohio Valley, the
unquestioned power of the colonists was exposed, and the successful
conclusion of the <font color="#2f4f4f">French and Indian </font>War
extended English territory as far as the Mississippi. The
geographical isolation created by the Appalachian Mountains had
contributed significantly to this strength. The confinement of the
colonies between the ocean and the mountain wall led to the fullest
possible occupation of the continental coastal frontiers, which was
possible under present agricultural conditions, and led to a common
purpose, political and commercial solidarity that would not otherwise
have been established. As early as 1700, it was possible to ride from
Portland, Maine, to southern Virginia, and stay overnight in a
prominent village every night. In contrast to this total industrial
occupation, the French territory was ruled by a small and very
dispersed population, and its size and openness greatly increased the
difficulties of contested tenure. The colonies suffered from this
dispute and prepared themselves for the ensuing struggle with the
government of the homeland. American armies, with no <font color="#556b2f">shipping</font>,
fought their way to the sea with mountains at their backs to protect
them against the British, who were allied with the <font color="#6b8e23">Indians</font>.
The few settlements behind the Great Valley were free to defend
themselves, but because of their location they could not participate
in the conflict in general.</p>

been </font>fired from <font color="#a9a9a9">the National Cash
Register Company by </font><font color="#dcdcdc">John Henry
Patterson</font>, contacted Flint, and <font color="#2f4f4f">in 1914
</font>was offered CTR. Watson took over as CTR's CEO, and 11 months
later became CEO after the lawsuits related to his time at NCR were
settled. After learning Patterson's pioneering business practices,
Watson went on to put the NCR stamp on CTR's businesses. He
introduced sales meetings, &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">generous sales
incentives, a focus on customer service</font>, a demand for
well-groomed salespeople dressed in dark suits and an evangelical
zeal for instilling company pride and loyalty in every employee&quot;.
His favourite slogan &quot;<font color="#a0522d">THINK</font>&quot;
became the mantra of every company employee. In Watson's first four
years, <font color="#228b22">turnover </font><font color="#191970">more
than doubled to $9 million, </font>and the company expanded into
Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. &quot;Watson had never
liked the clunky CTR name, which consisted of hyphens, and decided to
replace it with the broader name 'International Business Machines'.&quot;

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In chemistry, <font color="#a9a9a9">energy
</font>is a property of matter that is a consequence of its atomic,
molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation
involves a change in one or more of these structures, it invariably
involves an increase or decrease in the energy of the substances
involved. Some energy is transferred between the environment and the
reactants in the form of heat or light; thus, the reaction products
may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said
to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than
the initial state; in endergonic reactions the opposite is true.
Without exception, <font color="#dcdcdc">chemical reactions are </font>only
possible if the reactants cross an energy barrier called the
activation energy. The rate of a chemical reaction (at a given
temperature T) is related to the activation energy E by the <font color="#2f4f4f">Boltzmann

</font>is a property of all biological systems, from the biosphere to
the smallest living organism. In an organism, it is responsible for
the growth and development of a biological cell or organ of a
biological organism. <font color="#dcdcdc">Energy is </font>therefore
often said to be stored in cells in molecular structures such as
carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids and proteins, which release
energy when they react with oxygen during respiration. In human
terms, the human <font color="#2f4f4f">energy </font>equivalent (H-e)
(<font color="#2f4f4f">human energy conversion</font>) expresses the
relative amount of energy required for human metabolism for a given
energy expenditure, assuming an average human energy consumption of
12 500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For
example, if our body operates at (on average) 80 watts, a light bulb
operating at 100 watts will operate at 1.25 human equivalent (100 ÷
80), or 1.25 H-e. In a difficult task lasting only a few seconds, a
human can produce thousands of watts, which is many times more than
the <font color="#556b2f">746 </font><font color="#6b8e23">watts of
</font>one official horsepower. In tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit
person can produce perhaps <font color="#a0522d">1 000 </font>watts.
If the activity has to continue for an hour, the power drops to about
300; if the activity continues all day, 150 watts is about the
maximum. The human equivalent helps to understand energy flows in
physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human
terms: it gives a &quot;feel&quot; for the use of a given amount of
energy.</p>

struggled with internal divisions, particularly over the Arab Revolt
in its Arab holdings. The Ottoman government committed major
atrocities against Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks, which began
before the war but became more widespread and increasingly violent
during it. After the First World War, the Allied powers lost the
empire and occupied part of its territory, which led to the creation
of a new state, Turkey, in the Ottoman heartland of Anatolia after
the Turkish War of Independence, and to the creation of the modern
Balkan and Middle Eastern states and the partition of the Ottoman

</font>argues that the stagnation and decline was relentless after

a few brief revivals or reforms and recoveries. The decline
accelerated so that by <font color="#2f4f4f">1699 </font>the empire
was 'but a shadow of what had frightened both East and West in 1566'.
Although there are dissenting scholars, most historians point to
'degenerate sultans, incompetent grand vizier, weakened and
ill-equipped armies, corrupt officials, greedy speculators,
avaricious enemies and treacherous friends'. The main reason was a

empire's population rose <font color="#556b2f">to 30 million </font>by

these problems, the Ottoman state remained strong and its army did
not collapse or suffer crushing defeats. The only exceptions were the

<font color="#dcdcdc">the Young Turk revolution</font>. It restored
<font color="#2f4f4f">the Ottoman Constitution of </font>1876 and
brought the Ottoman Parliament under the Ottoman rule with a
two-party electoral system (electoral law). The constitution offered
hope by freeing the citizens of the Empire to modernise the
institutions of the state, rejuvenate its strength and enable it to
stand up to outside forces. The freedoms it guaranteed promised to
defuse tensions between communities and make the empire a more
harmonious place. Instead, this period became the story of the
Empire's turmoil. The young Turks of the movement, once underground
(a designated committee, group, etc.) founded (declared) their party.
Among them, the &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Committee of Union and
Progress&quot; and the &quot;Party of Freedom and Reconciliation&quot;
</font>were the largest parties. At the other extreme were the ethnic
parties, including Poale Zion, Al-Fatat and the Armenian National

annexed <font color="#6b8e23">Bosnia and Herzegovina </font>in 1908.
The last Ottoman census was carried out in the 1914 census. Ottoman
military reforms led to the modern Ottoman army, which took part in

according to the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres. This agreement,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Before the reforms of the 19th and
20th centuries, the Ottoman Empire's state organisation was a simple
system with two main dimensions: military and civil administration.
The <font color="#a9a9a9">Sultan was the highest position in </font>the
system. The civil system was based on <font color="#dcdcdc">local
administrative units based on the characteristics of the region</font>.
The Ottomans practised a system in which the <font color="#2f4f4f">state
</font>(as in the Byzantine Empire) controlled the clergy. Certain
pre-Islamic Turkic traditions, which had survived the administrative
and legal practices adopted from Islamic Iran, remained important in
Ottoman administrations. In the Ottoman conception, the primary role
of the state was to <font color="#556b2f">defend and expand Muslim
lands </font>and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Ottoman Empire or <font color="#a9a9a9">House
of Ottomans </font>as a dynastic institution was unprecedented in
size and duration and unparalleled in the Islamic world. In Europe,
only <font color="#dcdcdc">the Habsburg family </font>had a similarly
unbroken line of rulers (kings/emperors) from the same family, ruling
for the same length of time and in the same period, from the end of
the 13th century to the beginning of the 20th century. The Ottoman
dynasty was of <font color="#2f4f4f">Turkish </font>origin. <font color="#556b2f">Eleven
</font>times a sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the
Ottoman dynasty, who was either a brother, son or nephew of the
former sultan) because his enemies considered him a threat to the
state. There have only been two attempts in Ottoman history to
overthrow the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both of which failed,
suggesting a political system that was able to manage its revolution
over a long period of time without undue instability. The last
Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI (reigned <font color="#6b8e23">1918-1922),
</font>was a direct patrilineal (male) descendant of the first
Ottoman sultan, Osman I (reigned 1299-1326), which was unparalleled
both in Europe (for example, the male line of the Habsburg family
became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world. The primary purpose
of the imperial harem was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the
Ottoman throne and to ensure the continuation of direct patrilineal
(male) descent from the Ottoman sultans.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Islam's <font color="#a9a9a9">highest
position</font>, the caliphate, was claimed by sultans from Murad I
onwards, established as the Ottoman caliphate. The Ottoman sultan,
the <font color="#dcdcdc">pâdişâh, or 'lord of kings'</font>, was
the sole regent of the kingdom and was seen as the embodiment of its
administration, although he did not always exercise complete
authority. The imperial harem was one of the <font color="#2f4f4f">most
important kingdoms of the Ottoman court.</font> It was ruled by the
Sultan Valide. Sometimes the Sultan of Valide interfered in the
politics of the state. For a time, the women of the harem effectively
ruled the state in what was known as the 'women's sultanate'. New
sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The
palace school's strong education system aimed to <font color="#556b2f">weed
out unworthy potential heirs and to build support among the ruling
elite for a successor.</font> The palace schools, which also trained
future state administrators, were not monolithic. Firstly, the
madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: medrese) was for Muslims and trained
scholars and state officials in accordance with Islamic tradition.
The economic burden of the medrese was supported by standard fiefs,
which enabled the children of poor families to reach higher social
and income levels. The second track was a free boarding school for
Christians, <font color="#6b8e23">Enderûn</font>, which recruited
3,000 pupils a year from Christian boys in their eighties and
twenties, who came from one in every forty families in the
communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as
Devshirme (Devşirme).</p>

delegated. State policy was governed by a group of advisers and
ministers gathered around a council called <font color="#dcdcdc">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Ottoman legal system adopted
religious law for its subjects. At the same time, <font color="#a9a9a9">Qanun
(or Kanun)</font>, the secular legal system, coexisted with religious
law, or <font color="#dcdcdc">sharia</font>. The Ottoman Empire was
always organised around a local legal system. The Ottoman Empire's
legal system was part of a wider system in which <font color="#2f4f4f">central
and local government </font>were balanced. Ottoman power revolved
crucially around the administration of land rights, which gave local
authorities the space to develop the needs of the local milling
population. The Ottoman Empire's complex jurisdiction was designed to
enable the integration of culturally and religiously diverse groups.
The Ottoman system had <font color="#556b2f">three court systems</font>:
one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, which included appointed Jews
and Christians who governed their own religious communities, and a
'commercial court'. The whole system was governed from above by

courts for a stronger ruling on a matter. The Ottoman state generally
did not interfere in non-Muslim religious legal systems, although

legal system was developed from a combination of the <font color="#2f4f4f">Qur'an,
Hadīth</font>, the words of <font color="#556b2f">the Prophet
Muhammad</font>, ijmā, the consensus of the members of the Muslim

in the <font color="#a9a9a9">hills of western Anatolia in the </font>late

a complex organisation as the empire progressed. The Ottoman army was
a complex system of recruitment and fiefdoms. The main forces of the
Ottoman army included the <font color="#2f4f4f">janissaries, sipahs,
akıncı and mehterân. The </font>Ottoman army was once one of the
most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to
use <font color="#556b2f">muskets and cannons. The </font>Ottoman
Turks began using falconettes, which were short but wide guns, <font color="#6b8e23">during
the siege of Constantinople.</font> Relying on great speed and
mobility rather than heavy armour, the Ottoman cavalry used bows and
short swords on fast Turkish and Arabian horses (the ancestors of the
thoroughbred racehorse), and often employed tactics similar to those
of the Mongol Empire, such as feigning retreat and encircling enemy
forces in a crescent-shaped formation, then attacking for real. The
decline in army performance became clear from the mid-16th century
and after the Great Turkish War. Some limited success was achieved
against Venice in the 1700s, but in the north, European-style Russian
armies forced the Ottomans to surrender ground.</p>

(<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">سجع</span></font>, also

writing derived from the Arabic saj, which stipulated that <font color="#2f4f4f">there
must be a rhyme between every adjective and noun in a word-string,

Ali Aziz Efendi's </font>Muhayyelât ('Fantasies'), a collection of
fantastic tales written in <font color="#6b8e23">1796</font>, but not

was written by the Armenian Vartan Pasha. Published in 1851, it was

asymmetry can be </font>observed <font color="#dcdcdc">in a
non-intrinsic</font>, non-metaphysical <font color="#dcdcdc">way</font>,
when a human hand drops a cup of water, which breaks into pieces on a
hard floor, causing the liquid to spill. In this order, the causes of
the pattern of cup fragments and water leakage can be easily
explained by the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its
structure, the angle of impact with the floor, etc. However, if the
same event is applied in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the
different pieces of the cup fly into the human hand and reposition
themselves exactly in the shape of the cup, or why the water settles
completely inside the cup. The reasons for the structure and shape of
the cup and the encapsulation of water by the hand inside the cup are
not easy to pinpoint, since neither the hand nor the floor can
produce such cup or water formations. This asymmetry is observable
because of <font color="#2f4f4f">two </font>features: i) the
relationship between the agent capacity of the human hand (i.e. what
it can and cannot do and what it is for) and the agent capacity of
the non-animal hand (i.e. what the floor can and cannot do and what
it is for) and ii) the fact that the pieces of the cup came to
possess exactly the nature and number of the cup before assembly. In
short, such asymmetry is due to the relationship between the <font color="#556b2f">temporal

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In south-eastern Europe,
agricultural societies first emerged in the <font color="#a9a9a9">7th
millennium BC. This is </font>evidenced by one of Europe's earliest
agricultural sites, found <font color="#dcdcdc">in Vashtëm in
south-eastern Albania</font>, dating back to 6500 BC. <font color="#2f4f4f">Anthropomorphic
figurines have been </font>found in the Balkans since 6000 BC and in
Central Europe since around 5800 BC (La Hoguette). The earliest
cultural complexes in the region include the Sesklo culture of
Thessaly, which later expanded into the Balkans and gave rise to the
Starčevo Circle (Cris), Linearbandkeramik and Vinča. <font color="#556b2f">As
the culture spread and peoples migrated, </font>Neolithic traditions
spread west and north, reaching north-western Europe by around 4500
BC. The <font color="#6b8e23">Vinča culture </font>may have created
the earliest writing system, the Vinča characters, although
archaeologist Shan Winn believes that they represented pictographs
and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The
Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built huge settlements in Romania,
Moldova and Ukraine between 5300 and 2300 BC. The megalithic temple
complexes of Ġgantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the
Maltese archipelago) and Mnajdra in Malta are notable for their
gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date from around
3600 BC. The hypogeum of Ħal-Saflien in Paola, Malta, is an
underground structure excavated around 2500 BC; originally a
sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground
temple in the world, and displays stone sculpture unique in the
prehistory of the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese islands
were deserted for several decades until the arrival of new Bronze Age
migrants, a culture that cremated their dead and brought to Malta
smaller megalithic structures called dolmens. In most cases, there
are small chambers with a lid made of a large slab set on top of
vertical stones. They are said to belong to a population that is
certainly different from the one that built the earlier megalithic
temples. The population is thought to have come from Sicily, as the
Maltese dolmens resemble some of the small structures found on the
largest island in the Mediterranean.</p>

in Vienna to <font color="#a9a9a9">August von Hayek </font>and
Felicitas Hayek (née von Juraschek). Friedrich's father, from whom
he took his middle name, was also born in Vienna in 1871. He was a
doctor working for the municipal health department and had a passion
for <font color="#2f4f4f">botany, on which </font>he wrote several
monographs. August von Hayek was also a part-time lecturer in botany
at the University of Vienna. Friedrich's mother was born in 1875 into
a wealthy, conservative, landowning family. As <font color="#556b2f">her
mother </font>died several years before Friedrich was born, Felicitas
received a substantial inheritance, accounting for up to half of her
and August's income in the early years of their marriage. Hayek was
the eldest of <font color="#6b8e23">three </font>brothers, Heinrich
(1900-69) and Erich (1904-86), who were one and a half and five years
younger than him.</p>

von Juraschek </font>was a leading economist in Austria-Hungary and a
close friend of Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, one of the founders of the
Austrian school of economics. Von Juraschek was a statistician and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On his mother's side, Hayek was a
second cousin of the philosopher <font color="#a9a9a9">Ludwig
Wittgenstein</font>. His mother often played with Wittgenstein's
sisters and had known Ludwig well. Thanks to their family
relationship, <font color="#dcdcdc">Hayek was </font>among the first
to read <font color="#2f4f4f">Wittgenstein's Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus </font>when it was published in the original
German edition in 1921. Although Hayek met Wittgenstein <font color="#556b2f">only
a few times</font>, Hayek said that Wittgenstein's philosophy and
methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and
thinking. In his later years, Hayek recalled discussing philosophy
with Wittgenstein when <font color="#6b8e23">both were officers
</font>during the First World War. After Wittgenstein's death, Hayek
had intended to write a biography of Wittgenstein and worked on
collecting the genealogical material; he later assisted with
Wittgenstein's biographies.</p>

inclinations from a very young age. He <font color="#a9a9a9">read
fluently and often </font>before school<font color="#a9a9a9">. At </font><font color="#dcdcdc">his
father's </font>suggestion, Hayek read Hugo de Vries' works on
genetics and evolution and Ludwig Feuerbach's philosophical works as
a teenager. At school, Hayek was very impressed by a teacher's
lectures on Aristotle's ethics. In his unpublished autobiographical
notes, Hayek recalled a disagreement between himself and his
brothers, who were only a few years younger than him, but he believed
<font color="#556b2f">they were somehow of a different generation</font>.

University of Vienna, </font>Hayek received his doctorate in law in
1921 and in political science in 1923, and also studied philosophy,
psychology and economics. For a short time, after the University of
Vienna closed, Hayek studied <font color="#dcdcdc">at Constantin von
Monakow's Institute of Brain Anatomy</font>, where Hayek spent much
of his time staining brain cells. Hayek's time in Monakow's
laboratory and his deep interest in the work of Ernst Mach inspired
Hayek's first intellectual project, eventually published as <font color="#2f4f4f">The
Sensory Order </font>(1952). It placed integrative learning at the
physical and neurological levels and rejected the 'sense knowledge'
associationism of the empiricists and logical positivists. Hayek
presented his work with <font color="#556b2f">Herbert Furth at a

the University of Vienna, </font>Carl Menger's work on the strategy
of explanation in the social sciences and Friedrich von Wieser's
dominant presence in the classroom left a lasting impression on
Hayek. After graduation, Ludwig von Mises, on Wieser's
recommendation, hired Hayek as an expert for the <font color="#dcdcdc">Austrian
government</font>, working on the legal and economic details of the
Treaty of Saint Germain. From 1923 to 1924, Hayek worked <font color="#2f4f4f">as

Socialism, Hayek began to attend von Mises' private seminars and

Alfred Schutz, Felix Kaufmann and Gottfried Haberler, who also

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hayek was concerned about the
general view in British academic circles that fascism was a
capitalist reaction to socialism, and <font color="#a9a9a9">The Road
to Serfdom </font>was inspired by these concerns. It was written
between 1940 and 1943. The title of the book was inspired by the
writings of the French classical liberal thinker <font color="#dcdcdc">Alexis
de </font>Tocqueville on 'the road to serfdom'. It was first
published in Britain by Routledge <font color="#2f4f4f">in March 1944
</font>and was quite popular, prompting Hayek to call it 'that
hard-to-get book', partly due to wartime rationing of paper editions.
When the University of Chicago published it in the US in September
that year, it achieved greater popularity than in Britain<font color="#556b2f">.
</font>Arranged by editor <font color="#6b8e23">Max Eastman, </font>the
American Reader's Digest also published an abridged version in April
1945, which allowed The Road to Serfdom to reach a much wider

School of Economics <font color="#a9a9a9">for the University of

by <font color="#dcdcdc">an external foundation. </font>University of
Chicago President Robert Hutchins was in the middle of a war with the
Chicago faculty <font color="#2f4f4f">over institutional autonomy and
control, </font>and Hayek was caught in the middle of this struggle.
Hutchins had been trying to force all the institutions to adopt
Mortimer Adler's neo-Thomist Great Books programme, and the
economists at the University of Chicago were <font color="#556b2f">fed

was elected leader of the <font color="#a9a9a9">British Conservative
Party</font>. Shortly afterwards, the Institute of Economic Affairs
organised a meeting between <font color="#dcdcdc">Hayek </font>and
Thatcher in London. During Thatcher's only visit to the Conservative
Research Department in the summer of 1975, a speaker had prepared a
presentation on why <font color="#2f4f4f">the 'middle way' </font>was
the pragmatic path that the Conservative Party should take, avoiding
the extremes of left and right. Before she had finished, Thatcher
&quot;reached into her briefcase and took out a book. It was Hayek's

our pragmatist and held the book up for us all to see. 'This,' she

government in power has forfeited <font color="#2f4f4f">all right to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hayek's main economic studies
concerned <font color="#a9a9a9">capital</font>, money and business
cycles. Mises had already applied the concept of marginal utility to
the value of money in his <font color="#dcdcdc">Theory of Money and
Credit </font>(1912), in which he also proposed an explanation of
'industrial fluctuations' based on the ideas of the old British
school of monetary economics and the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.
Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own
interpretation of business cycles and developed what later became
known as '<font color="#2f4f4f">Austrian business cycle theory'.
</font>Hayek presented the Austrian approach in more detail in his
1929 book, the English translation of which appeared in 1933 under
the title <font color="#556b2f">Monetary Theory and the Trade </font>Cycle.
In it he advocated a monetary approach to the emergence of business
cycles. In Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the
business cycle was the result of an inflationary expansion of central
bank credit and its transmission over time, leading to a
misallocation of capital caused by <font color="#6b8e23">artificially
low interest rates.</font> Hayek argued that &quot;the past
instability of the market economy is the result of the exclusion of
money, the main regulator of the market mechanism, from the fact that
the market process itself is not regulated by it&quot;.</p>

Robbins </font>took over the reins of the London <font color="#dcdcdc">School
of Economics </font>(LSE). Wanting to promote alternatives to the

economics that he saw as dominating the English-speaking academic
world at the time (centred on Cambridge University and largely based
on the work of <font color="#556b2f">Alfred Marshall</font>), Robbins
invited Hayek to join the LSE faculty, and he joined in 1931.
According to Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek's theory of the time structure of
capital and business cycles 'initially fascinated the academic world'
and seemed to offer a <font color="#6b8e23">less 'frivolous and

theory.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1931 Hayek also criticised
Keynes' Treatise on Money (1930) in his book &quot;Reflections on the
pure theory of Mr. J. M. Keynes&quot; and published his lectures at
the LSE as a book entitled <font color="#a9a9a9">Prices and
Production</font>. Unemployment and idle resources are, according to
Keynes, the result of a lack of efficient demand; according to Hayek,
they are the result of a previous, unsustainable period of easy money
and <font color="#dcdcdc">artificially low interest rates</font>.
Keynes asked his friend <font color="#2f4f4f">Piero Sraffa </font>to
respond. Sraffa elaborated on the impact of inflation-induced 'forced
saving' on the capital sector and the definition of a 'natural' rate
of interest in a growing economy. Hayek's work on the business cycle
received negative responses from John Hicks, Frank Knight and Gunnar
Myrdal, among others. Kaldor later wrote that Hayek's Prices and
Production had produced <font color="#556b2f">&quot;a considerable
number of critics&quot; and that </font>the total number of pages
devoted to the debate in British and American journals was &quot;rarely

would be oversupply or shortages, which would mean that prices would

argued that the price mechanism allows for faster adaptation to

half of his career, </font>Hayek produced several works of social and
political philosophy based on his views on the limits of human
knowledge and the idea of the spontaneous order of social
institutions. He advocates a society organised around the <font color="#dcdcdc">market
order</font>, in which the state apparatus is used almost (though not
entirely) exclusively <font color="#2f4f4f">to enforce the legal
order </font>(consisting of abstract rules rather than specific
commands) necessary for the market of free individuals to function.
Underlying these ideas was a moral philosophy based on
epistemological concerns about the inherent limits of human
knowledge. According to Hayek, his ideal individualistic, free-market
society would be <font color="#556b2f">self-regulating </font>to the
extent that it would be 'a society whose functioning does not depend
on finding <font color="#6b8e23">good men </font>to run it'.</p>

&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">social justice</font>&quot;. He likened
the market to a game in which &quot;it <font color="#dcdcdc">makes no

&quot;social justice is an empty expression with no definable
content&quot;; similarly, &quot;the <font color="#2f4f4f">results of
individual effort are inevitably unpredictable </font>and the
question of whether the distribution of income is fair is
irrelevant&quot;. In general, he considered the redistribution of
income or capital by the state to be an unacceptable interference
with individual freedom: 'Once the principle of distribution has been
introduced, it will only be implemented once the whole of society has
been organised accordingly. This would create a society which would
be in all essential respects the <font color="#556b2f">opposite of a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hayek's notion of markets as
spontaneous orders has recently been applied to ecosystems in order
to defend a broadly <font color="#a9a9a9">non-interventionist policy</font>.
Like markets, ecosystems contain complex networks of information,
involve a continuous dynamic process, contain orders within orders,
and the whole system operates without the guidance of a conscious
mind. In this analysis, species replaces price as a visible part of a
system composed of a complex set of largely unknown elements. Human
ignorance of the myriad interactions between organisms in an
ecosystem limits <font color="#dcdcdc">our ability to manipulate
nature. </font>Since humans depend on the ecosystem for their
livelihoods, we have a <font color="#2f4f4f">prima facie </font>obligation
not to disturb such systems. This analysis of ecosystems <font color="#556b2f">as
spontaneous orders </font>is not based on the assumption that markets
can be considered spontaneous orders. Thus, one need not accept

to dictatorships. But a dictatorship can be a necessary system in a

prefer a <font color="#dcdcdc">liberal dictatorship </font>to a

that this will succeed, although at a given moment it may be the only
hope that exists.&quot; However, he explained, &quot;It is not a sure
hope because it always depends on the good will of the individual,
and there are very few individuals who can be trusted.&quot; Hayek
said, &quot;It is not a sure hope because it always depends on the
good will of the individual, and there are very few individuals you
can trust. But if it is the only possibility that exists at a given
moment, it may nevertheless be the best solution. And only if and

of economics is widely acknowledged. After <font color="#a9a9a9">Kenneth
Arrow, </font>Hayek is the second most frequently cited economist in
Nobel Prize lectures, which is particularly noteworthy because in his
own lecture Hayek was critical of orthodox economics and neoclassical
modelling. Several Nobel Prize winners in economics, such as Vernon
Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern
economist. Another Nobel laureate, <font color="#dcdcdc">Paul
Samuelson</font>, believed that Hayek was worthy of his prize, but
argued that &quot;there were good historical reasons why Hayek's
memory has faded among economists of the last half of the 20th
century. In 1931, <font color="#2f4f4f">Hayek's </font><font color="#556b2f">Prices

success. In retrospect, the nonsense about its production date
grossly misdiagnosed the historical macroeconomic scene of 1927-1931
(and 1931-2007).&quot; In retrospect, Hayek was not very good.
Despite this remark, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life
obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and
Böhm-Bawerk, and Samuelson judged Hayek to have been right and his

in which he criticized <font color="#a9a9a9">conservatism </font>for
its inability to adapt to changing human realities or to provide a

is only as good as what it preserves.&quot; </font>While he noted
that modern conservatism shares many economic views with classical
liberals, particularly <font color="#2f4f4f">a belief in free
markets</font>, he believed it is because conservatism wants to
&quot;stand still&quot; while liberalism embraces free markets
because it &quot;wants to go somewhere.&quot; Hayek defined himself
as a classical liberal, but noted that in the US it had become almost
impossible to use &quot;liberal&quot; in its original definition, and
instead the term &quot;<font color="#556b2f">libertarian&quot; </font>had

when too much water is absorbed into the intestines</font>. <font color="#dcdcdc">If
a person drinks solutions containing too much sugar or salt, they can
draw water from the body into the intestines </font>and cause osmotic
diarrhoea. Osmotic diarrhoea can also be the result of digestive
disorders (e.g. pancreatitis or celiac disease), where nutrients are
trapped in the lumen to draw water out. Or it can be caused by
osmotic laxatives (which <font color="#2f4f4f">relieve constipation
</font><font color="#556b2f">by drawing water into the intestines</font>).
In healthy people, <font color="#6b8e23">too much magnesium or

and bowel bloating. A person with lactose intolerance may have
difficulty absorbing <font color="#a0522d">lactose </font>after an
abnormally high intake of dairy products. In people with fructose
malabsorption, excessive fructose intake may also cause diarrhoea.
<font color="#228b22">High fructose foods</font>, which are also high
in glucose, are better absorbed and less likely to cause diarrhoea.
Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are
difficult for the body to absorb and can cause osmotic diarrhoea in
large quantities. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhoea ceases
when the harmful substance (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is discontinued.</p>

madrasah, plural <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">مدارس</span></font>,

institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion). The word
is variously transliterated as madrasah, madarasaa, medresa,
madrassa, madraza, medrese, etc. In the West, the word usually refers
to a particular <font color="#6b8e23">religious school </font>or
college where the religion of <font color="#a0522d">Islam is studied</font>,
although it is not necessarily the only subject studied. <font color="#228b22">Not

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The word madrasah comes from <font color="#a9a9a9">the

wazn (form/stem) <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">مفعل</span></font>(<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">ة</span></font>);
mafʻal(ah), meaning '<font color="#2f4f4f">a place where something
is done</font>'. Thus, madrasa literally means '<font color="#556b2f">a
place where learning and study take place</font>'. The word also
occurs as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many
Arabic-influenced languages, such as Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian,
Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian/Croatian. In
Arabic, the word <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">مدرسة </span></font>madrasah
simply means <font color="#6b8e23">the same as </font><font color="#a0522d">school
</font><font color="#6b8e23">in English, whether it is a </font>private,
public or parochial school or any primary or secondary school,
whether it is a Muslim school, a non-Muslim school or a secular
school. Unlike in British English, the word madrasah more closely
resembles the American English word school, as it can refer to a
university or post-graduate school as well as a primary or secondary
school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire in the early modern
period, madrasahs had <font color="#228b22">lower schools and </font><font color="#191970">special
schools </font>where students were known as <font color="#8b0000">danişmends.</font>
However, the usual Arabic word for university is <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">جامعة
</span></font>(jāmiʻah). The Hebrew colloquial term midrasha also
means a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers
to study or learning, but has taken on mystical and religious
connotations.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In English, however, the term
madrasah usually refers specifically to <font color="#a9a9a9">Islamic
educational institutions</font>. A typical Islamic school usually
offers two courses of study: the ḥifẓ course, which teaches
<font color="#dcdcdc">memorisation of </font><font color="#2f4f4f">the
Qur'an </font>(a person who memorises the entire Qur'an is called a
ḥāfiẓ), and the ʻālim course, which introduces the candidate
to becoming an accepted scholar in the community. The standard
curriculum includes courses in Arabic, tafsir (interpretation of the
Qur'an), sharīʻah (<font color="#6b8e23">Islamic law)</font>,
hadith (the recorded sayings and deeds of Muhammad), mantiq (<font color="#a0522d">logic)
</font>and Muslim history. In the early modern period of the Ottoman
Empire, the study of hadith was introduced by Süleyman I. Depending
on educational needs, some madrasas also offer advanced courses <font color="#228b22">in
Arabic literature</font>, English and other foreign languages, as
well as in natural sciences and world history. In addition to
religious instruction, Ottoman madrasas also taught 'writing styles,
grammar, syntax, poetry, composition, natural sciences, political
science and etiquette'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the early days of the Caliphate
or Islamic Empire, reliance on the courts initially limited
sponsorship and scientific activity to large centres. Over <font color="#a9a9a9">several
centuries, </font>the development of Muslim educational institutions
such as the madrasah and masjid eventually brought such activities to
provincial towns and cities and decentralised them to Islamic law
schools and Sufi organisations. In addition to religious subjects,
they also taught 'rational sciences' such as mathematics, astronomy,
astrology, geography, alchemy, philosophy, magic and occultism,
depending on the curriculum of the institution concerned. However,
the madars were not centres of advanced scientific research; the
advances in Islamic science were usually made by scholars working
under the patronage of the <font color="#dcdcdc">royal courts</font>.
During this period [when?] the <font color="#2f4f4f">caliphate
</font>experienced a growth in literacy, with the highest literacy
rate in the Middle Ages, comparable to that of classical Athens in
antiquity, but on a much larger scale. The emergence of the <font color="#556b2f">Maktab

primary schooling was known as <font color="#a9a9a9">maktab, which
dates back to </font>at least the <font color="#dcdcdc">10th century</font>.
Like madaris (which referred to higher education), the maktab was
often attached to a donated mosque. The famous Persian Islamic
philosopher and teacher <font color="#2f4f4f">Ibn Sīnā </font>(known
in the West as Avicenna) wrote a chapter on the maktab in a book
about the maktab in the 11th century entitled 'The role of the
teacher in the education and upbringing of children' as a guide for
teachers working in maktab schools. He wrote that children learn
better if they are taught <font color="#556b2f">in classrooms </font>rather
than individually by <font color="#6b8e23">private tutors, and </font>he
gave several reasons why this is so, citing the value of <font color="#a0522d">competition
and imitation </font>between pupils and the usefulness of group
discussions and debates. Ibn Sīnā described the curriculum of the
maktab school in some detail, describing the <font color="#228b22">two

include history, politics, ethics, music, metaphysics, medicine,

madrasas usually taught both religious and natural sciences. Madrasas

studying <font color="#a9a9a9">fiqh </font>(Islamic jurisprudence).
The medieval Islamic legal education system ijāzat al-tadrīs
wa-al-iftāʼ ('permission to teach and give legal opinions') took
root in the <font color="#dcdcdc">ninth century </font>after the
establishment of madhāhibs (law schools). George Makdisi considers
ijāzah to be the origin of <font color="#2f4f4f">the European
doctorate.</font> In an earlier article, however, he argued that the
ijāzah 'differs essentially' from the medieval doctorate, since the
former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar who was not
obliged to follow any formal criteria, while the latter was awarded
to the student by the collective authority of the faculty. To obtain
an ijāzah, a student &quot;had to study at a law guild school,
usually for <font color="#556b2f">four years </font>for the
<font color="#556b2f">undergraduate degree</font>&quot; and <font color="#6b8e23">ten
or more years </font>for the postgraduate degree. 'The degree of
doctor was awarded after an oral examination to determine the
originality of the applicant's theses' and to test the student's
'ability to defend them against all objections in the course of a
series of controversial hearings held for that purpose'. These were
scientific exercises that were practised throughout the student's
&quot;career as a postgraduate law student&quot;. Once the students
had completed their postgraduate studies, they were granted ijazat,
which gave them the status of faqīh 'scholar of jurisprudence',
muftī 'scholar qualified to give fatwas' and mudarri 'teacher'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, Madaris's classification of
&quot;universities&quot; is disputed in terms of how each institution
is understood on its own terms. In the Madaris, ijāzas were given in
only one field, the <font color="#a9a9a9">sharīʻah of Islamic
religious law, </font>and in no other field of learning. Other
academic subjects, such as science, philosophy and literary studies,
were treated only as 'aids' to the study of shari'ah. For example,
natural sciences such as astronomy were studied (if at all) only <font color="#dcdcdc">to
meet religious needs </font>such as prayer time. For this reason,
<font color="#2f4f4f">Ptolemaic astronomy </font>was considered
sufficient, and is still taught in some modern-day madrasas. The
undergraduate degree in Islamic law <font color="#556b2f">at
al-Azhar</font>, the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally
awarded without final examinations, but on the basis of students'
attentive attendance of courses. Unlike the medieval doctorate, which
was awarded on the basis of the collective <font color="#6b8e23">authority
of the faculty</font>, the Islamic degree was not awarded by the
<font color="#a0522d">teacher </font>to the student on the basis of
any formal criteria, but was 'a personal matter which was the sole
prerogative of the awardee; no one could force him to award it'.</p>

experts who </font>define a university as a legally independent
company disagree with the use of the term &quot;university&quot; for
Islamic madrasas and jāmiʻahs, because the medieval university
(from the Latin universitas) was structurally different, being a
legally independent company rather than a waqf institution like the
<font color="#dcdcdc">madrasa and </font><font color="#2f4f4f">jāmiʻah</font>.
Despite many similarities, medieval scholars have coined the term
'<font color="#556b2f">Islamic university' for </font>madrasah and

corporations that medieval European universities were. In a sense,
the madrasa is similar to a university college in that it has most of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As a Muslim educational institution,
the madrasa was legally waqf. In central and eastern Islamic
countries, the view that the madrasa remains a charitable endowment
under the control of <font color="#a9a9a9">the donor </font>(and his
descendants) led to the establishment of madaris in <font color="#dcdcdc">the
1100s and 1200s</font>. However, <font color="#2f4f4f">in Western
Islamic countries, where </font>Maliki beliefs prohibited donors from
controlling their donations, madaris was less popular. Unlike the
corporate designation of Western higher education institutions, the
waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-Orthodox
religious subjects such as philosophy and science from the
curriculum. Al-Qarawīyīn madrasa, one of the two surviving madrasas
that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities,
which some authors claim to be the &quot;first universities&quot;,
only gained official university status in <font color="#556b2f">1947.
</font>The second, al-Azhar, only acquired this status nominally and
substantially during the numerous reforms of the 19th and 20th
centuries, notably the 1961 reform which introduced non-religious
subjects such as <font color="#6b8e23">economics, engineering,
medicine and agriculture into </font>its curriculum. It should also
be noted that many medieval universities operated for centuries as
Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools before their formal
establishment as universitas scholarium; evidence of these immediate
predecessors of the university dates back to the 6th century AD and
thus well before the earliest Madars. George Makdisi, who has
published most extensively on the subject, states the following in
his comparison of the two institutions:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, Makdisi has argued that <font color="#a9a9a9">the
European university has </font>borrowed many features from the
Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of <font color="#dcdcdc">a
degree and a doctorate</font>. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also
highlighted other terms and concepts used in modern universities that
are likely to have Islamic origins, such as &quot;the fact that we
still talk about professors having a 'chair' for their subject&quot;,
based on &quot;the traditional Islamic teaching model of the
professor sitting on a chair and the students sitting around him&quot;,
the term 'academic circles' derives from the way in which Islamic
students 'sat in a circle around their professor', and the terms
'comrades', 'reading' and obtaining 'degrees' can all be traced back
to the Islamic concepts of aṣḥāb ('companions of Muhammad'),
qirāʼah ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and ijāzah ('permission [to
teach]'). Makdisi has listed <font color="#2f4f4f">eighteen </font>such
terminological parallels that can be traced back to their roots in
Islamic education. Makdisi and Goddard trace back to their Islamic
roots some of the practices that are now common in today's
universities, such as 'practices such as giving inaugural lectures,
<font color="#556b2f">wearing </font><font color="#6b8e23">academic
</font><font color="#556b2f">robes</font>, obtaining a doctorate by
defending a dissertation, and even the idea of <font color="#a0522d">academic
</font>freedom are also modelled on Islamic custom'. The Islamic
system of doctrine, fatwa and ijmāʻ, which means opinion and
consensus, formed the basis of &quot;the system of doctrine that the
West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages to
the present day&quot;. According to Makdis and Goddard, the idea of
'academic freedom' in universities was also the 'model of Islamic
custom' practised in the medieval madrasa system from the 900s
onwards. The influence of Islam was &quot;certainly discernible in
the founding of Europe's first deliberately planned university&quot;,
the University of Federico II of Naples, founded by the Holy Roman
Emperor Frederick II of Saxe-Roman Britain in 1224.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, all these aspects of
medieval university life are considered by established scholarship to
be independent medieval European developments, with no discernible
influence of Islam. More generally, some critics have pointed out
that Makdisi tends to <font color="#a9a9a9">overstate his case</font>,
relying only on an 'accumulation of <font color="#dcdcdc">close
parallels</font>', but fails to show convincing channels of
transition between the Muslim world and the <font color="#2f4f4f">Christian
world. </font>Norman Daniel points out that the Arabic equivalent of
the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the court of the
ruler, not the madrasa, and that the real differences between the
Islamic fiqh and medieval European <font color="#556b2f">civil law
</font>were profound. Taliqa reached Islamic Spain, the only likely
transition point, only after the establishment of the first medieval
universities. In fact, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa
and, more importantly, there is no evidence that Latin-speaking
scholars were ever aware of the Arab influence on the Latin method of
disputation, although they would certainly have considered it
significant. Rather, the medieval reception of the Greek Organon set
the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that the
similarities in method had more to do with the fact that the two
religions had 'common problems: reconciling the conflicting
statements of their respective authorities and protecting the
revelatory data from the influence of Greek philosophy'; thus
Christian scholasticism and similar Arabic concepts should be seen as
<font color="#6b8e23">parallel events</font>, not as a shift of ideas
from one to the other, and Hugh Kennedy agrees.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Sunni scholar Ibn ʻAsākir
wrote in the 13th century that there were opportunities for women's
education in the medieval Islamic world, and wrote that women could
study, earn ijazahe (academic degrees) and qualify as <font color="#a9a9a9">scholars

and educated families who </font>wanted to ensure the highest
possible education for both their sons and daughters. Ibn ʻAsakir
himself had studied under 80 different female teachers in his time.
Female education in the Islamic world was inspired by the <font color="#2f4f4f">wives
of Muhammad</font>, such as <font color="#556b2f">Khadija</font>, a
successful businesswoman. According to a hadith dedicated to
Muhammad, he praised the women of Medina <font color="#a0522d">for

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">&quot;The first <font color="#a9a9a9">Ottoman
medrese </font>was established in İznik in <font color="#dcdcdc">1331,</font>
and most Ottoman medrese followed the Sunni Muslim tradition.&quot;
&quot;When the Ottoman Sultan established a new medrese, he invited
scholars from the Islamic world - for example, Murad II brought
scholars from Persia, such as ʻAlāʼ al-Dīn and Fakhr al-Dīn, who
helped to improve the reputation of the Ottoman medrese.&quot; This
shows that the Islamic world was in contact with each other in the
early modern period as they travelled to other Islamic states and
exchanged information. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was
modernising through globalisation is also recognised by Hamadeh, who
says: &quot;The transformation in the eighteenth century at the
beginning of a long and non-linear march towards Westernization
reflects two centuries of reform in sovereign identity&quot;. İnalcık
also mentions that while Persian scholars, for example, travelled to
Ottomans to share their knowledge, <font color="#2f4f4f">Ottomans
</font>also travelled to receive education from scholars in these
Islamic countries, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. This
therefore shows that, like the modern world today, individuals in
early modern society travelled abroad for education and to share
knowledge, and that the world was more interconnected than it seems.
It also reveals that the 'school system' was similar to today's
modern world, with students travelling abroad to different countries
to study. Examples of Ottoman madaris include those built by Mehmed
the Conqueror. He built <font color="#556b2f">eight </font>madaris,
which were built 'on either side of the mosque, with eight higher
madaris for special studies and eight lower madaris to prepare
students for these studies'. The fact that they were built around or
<font color="#6b8e23">close to the mosque </font>reveals the
religious impulses behind the construction of the madrasas and shows
the link between learning institutions and religion. Students who
completed their education in the lower madrasas became danismendi.
This reveals that, similar to the modern education system, the
Ottoman education system included a variety of schools associated
with different levels. For example, there were lower madars and
specialised madars, and to enter a specialised area meant that one
had to <font color="#a0522d">complete lower madar classes in order to
be </font>adequately prepared for higher education.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"> When was the first Ottoman madrasa

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 26</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although the Ottoman madrasas had
several branches of study, such as calligraphy, oral sciences and
intellectual sciences, they functioned primarily as an Islamic centre
of <font color="#a9a9a9">spiritual learning</font>. &quot;The goal of
all knowledge, and especially of the spiritual sciences, is the
knowledge of God.&quot; Religion largely determines the meaning and
importance of each science. As İnalcık mentions, &quot;Sciences
that support religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.&quot;
However, although the study of mathematics or logic was part of the
madrasa curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even the
mathematics lessons had a religious impulse. &quot;The Ottoman
Medrese ulema believed that opposing logic and mathematics was futile
because they accustomed the mind to right thinking and thus helped to
reveal divine truths&quot; - the key word being &quot;divine&quot;.
İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy could only be studied if
it helped to <font color="#dcdcdc">confirm the teachings of </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Islam.
</font>' Thus, madaris schools were essentially religious centres for
religious teaching and learning in the Ottoman world. Although
scholars like Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly
tolerant and lived in <font color="#556b2f">a pluralistic </font>society,
it seems that the schools, which were the main centres of learning,
were in fact heavily religious and were not religiously pluralistic
but centred around <font color="#6b8e23">Islam.</font> Similarly, in
Europe, 'Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and basic prayers
at home and then went to a school run by the synagogue to study
Torah'. Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach
&quot;correct religious values&quot;. This shows that in the early
modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas
about how schools should be run and what their primary focus should
be. Ottoman madrasas were thus very similar to modern schools in the
sense that they offered a wide range of <font color="#a0522d">studies</font>;
however, the ultimate aim of these studies was to further consolidate
and establish Islamic practices and theories.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As in other early modern countries,
such as Italy and Spain in Europe, Ottoman social life was tied to
the medresque. Medresques were built as part of the mosque complex,
where many programmes, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">helping the poor
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">through soup kitchens, </font>were
organised within the mosque infrastructure, revealing the
interconnectedness of <font color="#2f4f4f">religion </font>and
social life in this period. &quot;Mosques, with which the medes were
associated, dominated the social life of Ottoman cities.&quot; In the
Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire, social life was not only
dominated by <font color="#556b2f">religion</font>, but was also
quite similar to European social life at the time. As Goffman says:
&quot;Just as mosques dominated Ottoman social life, churches and
synagogues dominated Christian and Jewish life.&quot; Social life and
the medresques were thus closely linked, as the <font color="#6b8e23">medresques
</font>taught many curricula, including religion, which strongly
dominated social life for the establishment of orthodoxy. &quot;They
tried to move their nascent state towards <font color="#a0522d">Islamic
orthodoxy. </font>&quot;Overall, the fact that the mosques contained
medreshas shows the link between education and religion in the sense
that education took place within the framework of religion and
religion consolidated social life by seeking to establish a common
religious orthodoxy. Thus, <font color="#228b22">medreses </font>were
simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn
the foundations of their social values and beliefs.</p>

commentators often view madrassas as sites of radical awakening,
associated with <font color="#a9a9a9">anti-Americanism and radical
extremism</font>, and in the Western press they are often associated
with Wahhabi attitudes towards non-Muslims. In Arabic, the word
madrasa simply means 'school' and does not refer to political or
religious orientation, radical or otherwise. <font color="#dcdcdc">Madrasas</font>
have <font color="#dcdcdc">different curricula and </font>not all are
religious. For example, some madrasas in India have a <font color="#2f4f4f">secular
</font>identity. Although the early madrasas were founded primarily
for 'knowledge of God', they also taught mathematics and poetry. In
the Ottoman Empire, for example, 'madrasas taught <font color="#556b2f">seven
</font>disciplines, including: writing styles, oral sciences such as
Arabic, grammar, rhetoric and history, and intellectual sciences such
as logic'. This is reminiscent of the Western world, where

in the United States designed by a woman, <font color="#a9a9a9">Julia
Tuttle</font>&quot;, a local citrus grower and wealthy Cleveland
native. The Miami area was better known in its early years of growth
as '<font color="#2f4f4f">Biscayne Bay Country'.</font> In the late
19th century, reports described the area as a promising wilderness.
The area was also described as 'one of the finest building sites in
Florida'. The great frost of <font color="#556b2f">1894-95 </font>boosted
Miami's growth, as the Miami area's crops were the only ones in
Florida that survived. <font color="#6b8e23">Julia Tuttle </font>later
convinced railroad magnate Henry Flagler that his <font color="#a0522d">Florida
East Coast Railway </font>should be extended to the area, for which
she became known as the 'Mother of Miami'. Miami was officially
incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896, with a population of just
over 300. It was named after the nearby Miami River, derived from the
Mayaim, the historic name of Lake Okeechobee.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The bedrock beneath the Miami area
is called <font color="#a9a9a9">Miami oolite </font>or Miami
limestone. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil up to <font color="#dcdcdc">15
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">metres </font>(50 feet) thick. The Miami
Limestone was formed as a result of recent glacial or ice age-related
sea level changes. The <font color="#6b8e23">Sangamonian phase</font>,
which began about 130 000 years ago, raised sea levels to about <font color="#a0522d">8
</font>metres above present levels. All of southern Florida was
covered by shallow seas. Several parallel reef lines formed along the
edge of the submerged Florida Plateau, extending from the present-day
Miami area to the present-day Dry Tortugas area. The area behind
these reef lines was effectively a large lagoon, and the Miami
Limestone was formed throughout the area by the deposition of oolites
and mound shells. Around 100 000 years ago, the <font color="#228b22">Wisconsin
glaciation began to </font>lower the sea level, exposing the lagoon
floor. By 15 000 years ago, sea level had dropped 300-350 feet
(90-110 m) below present levels. Sea levels then rose rapidly and
stabilized at their current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the
South Florida mainland just above sea level.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This was also a time of nightclub
options. The warehouse parties, acid house, rave and open-air
festivals of the late 1980s and early 1990s were havens for the
latest trends in electronic dance music, especially house and its
increasingly hypnotic, synthetic offspring, techno and trance, at
clubs such as the infamous Warsaw Ballroom, better known as Warsaw,
and The Mix, which featured DJs such as <font color="#a9a9a9">David
Padilla </font>(who was resident DJ for both), and radio. The new
sound returned to mainstream clubs across the country. The <font color="#dcdcdc">SoBe
</font>scene and the bustling second-hand market for electronic
instruments and turntables had a strong democratising effect,
offering amateur 'bedroom' DJs the opportunity to become skilled and
popular as both players and producers, regardless of the vagaries of
the professional music and club industry. Some of these prominent DJs
include John Benetiz (better known as <font color="#2f4f4f">JellyBean

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Miami area has a unique dialect
(commonly referred to as the &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Miami
accent&quot;) that is </font>widely spoken. The dialect developed
among second or third generation Hispanics, such as Cuban-Americans,
whose native language was English (although it is also adopted by
some non-Hispanic whites, blacks and other races born and raised in
the Miami area). It is based on a fairly standard American accent,
but with some modifications that are very similar to those found in
<font color="#dcdcdc">Mid-Atlantic </font>dialects (particularly
those of the New York area, northern New Jersey English, and New York
Latin English). Unlike the Piedmont, Coastal Southern American and
Northeast American dialects of Virginia and the Cracker dialect of
Florida (see below), the Miami accent is rhythmic; it also has a
rhythm and pronunciation that are heavily influenced by <font color="#2f4f4f">Spanish
</font>(the rhythm is syllabic). However, this is a dialect of native
English, not the learner's English or the intermediate language; this
variant can be distinguished from the intermediate language spoken by
speakers of another language in that the 'Miami accent' does not
usually have the following features: /ɛ/ is not added before the
initial consonant clusters of /s/ consonants, speakers do not confuse
/dʒ/ with /j/, (e.g., Yale and prison), and /r/ and /rr/ are
pronounced as an alveolar approximation [ɹ] rather than being
pronounced in Spanish as an alveolar tap [ɾ] or alveolar trill [r].</p>
