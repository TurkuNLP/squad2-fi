had </font><font color="#6b8e23">more difficulty remembering
acoustically similar letter sequences </font>(e.g. E, P, D). The

were encoded acoustically. </font>However, Conrad's (1964) study was
concerned with <font color="#8b0000">the encoding of written text</font>,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Short-term memory is also known as
<font color="#a9a9a9">working memory</font><font color="#dcdcdc">.
</font>Short-term memory allows you <font color="#2f4f4f">to remember
anything from a few seconds to a minute without practice. </font>Its
<font color="#556b2f">capacity is also very limited</font>. <font color="#6b8e23">Miller
</font>(<font color="#a0522d">1956</font>) carried out experiments
that showed that short-term memory had a storage capacity of 7±2
(the title of his famous article was &quot;The magic number 7±2&quot;).
Modern estimates of short-term memory capacity are lower, usually in
the order of 4-5 memories; however, memory capacity can be increased
<font color="#228b22">by chopping. For example, </font>when
remembering a ten-digit telephone number, a person can split the
numbers <font color="#191970">into three groups</font>: first the
area code (e.g. 123), then the three-digit part (456) and finally the
four-digit part (7890). This way of remembering phone numbers is much
more efficient than trying to remember a string of 10 digits; this is
because <font color="#8b0000">we can break the information down into
meaningful groups of numbers</font>. This may be reflected in some
countries by the fact that phone numbers are displayed as a series of
two or four digits.</p>

information <font color="#a9a9a9">less than a second after an </font>object

looked like in just a fraction of a second of observation or recall
is an example of sensory memory. <font color="#dcdcdc">It is beyond

presentations, participants often report that they seem to &quot;see&quot;

investigating this form of <font color="#2f4f4f">sensory memory were
</font>conducted by <font color="#556b2f">George Sperling </font>(1963)
using the &quot;partial reporting paradigm&quot;. Subjects were
presented with a 12-letter grid arranged in three rows of four
letters. After a brief presentation, subjects were played either a
high, medium, or low tone to guide them to tell which row to report.
From these experiments with partial reporting, Sperling was able to
show that the capacity of sensory memory was around 12 letters, but
that it deteriorated very quickly (within a few hundred
milliseconds). Because <font color="#6b8e23">this form of memory
decays so quickly, participants could see the screen but were unable
to report all items </font>(12 <font color="#6b8e23">items </font>in
the &quot;full report&quot; procedure) before they decayed. This type

affect the acquisition or retrieval of memory while awake</font>.
Therefore, sleep has the greatest impact on memory consolidation.
<font color="#dcdcdc">During sleep, </font>neural connections in <font color="#dcdcdc">the
brain </font>are strengthened. This improves the brain's ability to
stabilise and retain memories. <font color="#2f4f4f">There have been
several studies showing that sleep improves memory retention </font>because
memories are strengthened through active consolidation. System
<font color="#556b2f">stabilisation occurs </font>during slow wave
sleep (SWS). This process suggests that memories are reactivated
during sleep, but the process does not enhance all memories. It also
suggests that qualitative changes occur in memories when they are
transferred to long-term storage during sleep. While you sleep, the
hippocampus plays back the day's events to the neocortex. The
neocortex then <font color="#a0522d">reviews and processes the
memories, after which they are transferred to long-term memory</font>.
When you don't get enough sleep, learning becomes more difficult
because these neural connections are not as strong, making memories
less retained. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to concentrate,
leading to ineffective learning. In addition, some studies have shown
that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories because memories
are not properly transferred to long-term memory. Therefore, it is
important to get enough sleep so that memory can function at its
best. One of the primary functions of sleep is considered to be
improving the consolidation of knowledge, as several studies have
shown that memory is dependent on adequate sleep between training and
testing. In addition, data from neuroimaging studies have shown <font color="#228b22">that
activation patterns in the sleeping brain mirror those recorded
during learning of the previous day's tasks</font>, suggesting that
new memories can be solidified through such training.</p>

Amnesia can result from extensive lesions in: (a) areas of the medial

amygdala, parahippocampal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, or (b)
the midline diencephalon area, particularly the dorsomedial nucleus
of the thalamus and the mammillary trunks of the hypothalamus. <font color="#2f4f4f">There
are many types of memory disorders</font><font color="#556b2f">, </font>and
by studying their different forms it has been possible to identify

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although people often think of
memory as a storage device, this is not the case. The molecular
mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are
highly dynamic, with distinct steps that span from seconds to a
lifetime. In fact, research has revealed <font color="#a9a9a9">that
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">our memories are structured</font>.
People can construct their memories <font color="#2f4f4f">when they
encode them and/or when they recall them. </font>An example is the
classic study <font color="#6b8e23">by Elizabeth Loftus and John
Palmer </font>(1974) in which people were directed to watch a film of
a road accident and then asked what they saw. The researchers found
that people who were asked &quot;How fast were the cars going when
they hit each other?&quot; gave higher ratings than people who were
asked &quot;How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?&quot;.
In addition, when asked a week later if they had seen broken glass in
the film, those who had been asked the question smashed were twice as
likely to report seeing broken glass than those who had been asked
the question hit. No <font color="#a0522d">broken glass </font>was
filmed in the movie. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted
viewers' memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the
question caused people to construct different memories of the event -
those who were asked the question smashed remembered a more serious
car accident than what they had actually seen. The results of this
experiment were replicated around the world, and the researchers
consistently showed <font color="#228b22">that </font><font color="#191970">when
people were given misleading information, they tended to remember the
event incorrectly, </font><font color="#8b0000">a phenomenon known as

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Laws from colonial America in the
1700s stipulated that the <font color="#a9a9a9">children of African
slave mothers </font><font color="#dcdcdc">took the place of their

</font>regardless of the race or status of the father, according to
the principle of<font color="#556b2f"> partus sequitur ventrem</font>.
The association of slavery with 'race' led to slavery becoming a
racial caste. However, most free coloured families formed in Virginia
before the American Revolution were the offspring of unions between
<font color="#6b8e23">white women and African men</font>, who often
worked and lived together in the looser conditions of the early
colonial period. Although interracial marriages were later banned,
<font color="#a0522d">white men </font>often sexually exploited slave
women, and numerous generations of multiracial children were born. By
the late 19th century, it had become common for African Americans to
use the passage <font color="#228b22">to gain educational
opportunities</font>, as did the first African American graduate of
Vassar College, <font color="#191970">Anita Florence Hemmings. </font>Some
19th century classification systems defined people according to the
proportion of African ancestry: a person with <font color="#8b0000">black
and white parents was </font>classified as a mulatto, a person with
one black grandparent and three whites as a quadroon, and a person
with <font color="#483d8b">one black great-grandparent and the rest
white as an </font>octoroon. The latter categories remained within
the general black or colored category, but before the Civil War in
Virginia and some other states, a person with one-eighth or less
black ancestry was legally white. Some members of these classes
became temporarily or permanently white.</p>

identified by the <font color="#a9a9a9">concept of Yiddishkeit</font>,
which means <font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;Jewishness&quot; </font>in
Yiddish. Yiddishkeit is specifically Ashkenazi Jewry. Before the
Haskalah and the emancipation of European Jews, it meant Torah and
Talmudic study for men, and family and communal life for men and
women, guided by the observance of Jewish law. From the Rhineland to
Riga and Romania to Romania, most Jews prayed <font color="#2f4f4f">liturgical
Ashkenazi Hebrew </font>and spoke <font color="#556b2f">Yiddish </font>in
their secular lives. With modernisation, however, Yiddishkeit no
longer encompasses only Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a wide range of
movements, ideologies, practices and traditions in which Ashkenazi
Jews have participated and somehow retained their sense of
Jewishness. Although a <font color="#6b8e23">much smaller proportion
of Jews still speak Yiddish</font>, Yiddishkeit is recognisable in
speech patterns, humour and socialising patterns. Broadly speaking, a
Jew is a person who interacts culturally with Jews, supports Jewish
institutions, reads Jewish books and magazines, attends Jewish films
and theatre, travels to Israel, visits historic synagogues and so on.
The definition applies to Jewish culture in general and Ashkenazi
Yiddishkeit in particular.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A 2010 study by Bray et al. using
SNP microarray techniques and linkage analysis found that, assuming
that Druze and Palestinian Arab populations represent the genome of
World Jewish ancestors, <font color="#a9a9a9">35-55% of the </font>modern
Ashkenazi genome could potentially be of European origin and that
European &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">admixture is significantly
greater </font>than estimates from previous studies using the Y
chromosome&quot; using this reference point. Assuming this reference
point, the linkage disequilibrium of the Ashkenazi-Jewish population
was interpreted as &quot;corresponding to signs of interbreeding or
'mixing' between Middle Eastern and European populations&quot;. Bray
et al.'s tree showed Ashkenazi Jews to be <font color="#2f4f4f">a

French, Basques, Italians, Sardinians and Tuscans. The study also
found that Ashkenazis are <font color="#556b2f">more diverse </font>than

<font color="#6b8e23">Ashkenazis are assumed to be a subset of </font>their

not reflect population antiquity but the history of mixing of
genetically distinct populations in Europe. However, it is possible
that the relaxation of marriage rules in the Ashkenazim ancestors
drove their heterozygosity upwards, while the preservation of the FBD
rule in the indigenous Middle Easterners kept their heterozygosity
values in check. The peculiarity of the Ashkenazim observed in the
Bray et al. study may therefore be due to their ethnic endogamy
(ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to 'mine' their ancestral
gene pool in relative reproductive isolation from their European
neighbours, rather than clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Thus, their
greater diversity compared to Middle Easterners is due to the
latter's marriage practices, not necessarily to their interbreeding
with Europeans.</p>

marriage of two Jews of different ethnic backgrounds, when a non-Jew
converts to Judaism and finds out what customs to follow for the

Jewish troops were among the Syrian soldiers who were transferred
there and replenished from the Middle East after 175 AD. Jews,
especially Syrians, came from Antioch, Tarsus and Cappadocia. Others
came from Italy and the Hellenised parts of the Roman Empire.
According to the excavations, they initially lived in separate
enclaves attached to the camps of the Roman legions, and intermarried
with other similar oriental families within the military orders of
the region. Raphael Patai notes that later Roman writers remarked
that they differed little in their customs, spelling or names from
the people among whom they lived, and that the Jews were particularly
difficult to distinguish from the Syrians. After the surrender of
Pannonia to the Huns in <font color="#2f4f4f">433</font>, the

DNA units making up the mitochondrial DNA (only 1,000 units had been
tested in Behar's 2006 study), and the study found that the four main
female Ashkenazi founders had lineages that originated in Europe
10,000-20,000 years ago, while most of the remaining smaller founders
also had deep European ancestry. The study notes that the majority of
Ashkenazi maternal lineages did not come from the Middle East (i.e.
they were not Israelite) nor were they recruited from the Caucasus
(i.e. they were not Khazar), but were assimilated in Europe, mainly
from Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarised the findings
on the female lineage as follows: '[N]one [of the mtDNAs] was from
the northern Caucasus, located on the European-Asian border between
the Black and Caspian Seas. All the research currently available,
including my own, should thoroughly disprove one of the most dubious

broad groups: <font color="#a9a9a9">Middle Eastern Jews and

proximity of European Jews to each other and to Southern European

the &quot;extensive genetic contribution of Central and Eastern
European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry&quot;,
since both groups - Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews -
had common ancestors in the Middle East around 2500 years ago. The

that Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi) share extensive
DNA:DNA fragments, suggesting close family relationships, and that
each of the Jewish groups included in the study (Iranians, Iraqis,
Syrians, Italians, Turks, Greeks and Ashkenazis) have their own

conquest of England, William the Conqueror welcomed the Jews of
continental Europe to live there. Bishop Rüdiger Huzmann urged the
Jews of Mainz to move to Speyer. In all these decisions, the idea
that Jews had the know-how and ability to start an economy, improve
incomes and expand trade seems to have played a major role.
Typically, Jews settled near markets and churches in urban centres,
where they were subject to both royal and ecclesiastical authority,
but still enjoyed administrative autonomy.</p>

attributed the ethnogenesis of most of the world's Jewish
populations, including Ashkenazi Jews, to male Israeli-Jewish
immigrants from the Middle East and &quot;the women of each local
population whom they took as wives and converted to Judaism&quot;.
Thus, in 2002 , in line with this model of origin, David Goldstein,
now of Duke University, reported that, unlike the male Ashkenazi
Jewish lineages, the female lineages of Ashkenazi Jewish communities
&quot;did not appear to be from the Middle East&quot;, and that each
community had its own genetic pattern and that &quot;in some cases
the mitochondrial DNA was closely related to the DNA of the host
community&quot;. In his view, this suggested &quot;that Jewish men
had arrived from the Middle East, taken wives from the host
community, converted them to Judaism and then stopped marrying
non-Jews&quot;.</p>

adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered,
triggering both the search for mechanisms of chemical signalling and
efforts to exploit these findings to develop new drugs. The
hypotensive and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of
particular interest to surgeons, who used them as haemostatic agents
and for the treatment of shock, and several companies developed
adrenal extract-based products containing the active substance in
varying degrees of purity. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1897, John Abel

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The modern pharmaceutical industry
has its roots in two sources. The first was the local pharmacists
who, <font color="#a9a9a9">in the mid-19th century, </font>expanded
their traditional role from the distribution of herbal medicines such
as morphine and quinine to wholesale. The rational invention of
medicines from plants began, in particular, with the isolation <font color="#dcdcdc">from
opium of </font>morphine, a painkiller and sleep-inducer, by
<font color="#2f4f4f">Friedrich Sertürner, a </font>German
pharmacist's assistant, who named the compound after the Greek god of
dreams, Morpheus<font color="#556b2f">. </font>Multinational
companies such as Merck, Hoffman-La Roche, Burroughs-Wellcome (now
part of <font color="#6b8e23">Glaxo Smith Kline</font>), Abbott
Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) began
operating as local pharmacies in <font color="#a0522d">the mid-19th
century. </font>By the late 1880s, <font color="#228b22">German dye
manufacturers </font>had developed the purification of individual
organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had
also developed rudimentary methods for the synthesis of organic
chemistry. The development of synthetic chemistry enabled scientists
to systematically change the structure of chemicals, and the growth
of the emerging science of pharmacology expanded the ability of
scientists to assess the biological effects of these structural
changes.</p>

development was made throughout this period, mainly in the form of
academic and government-funded basic research aimed at identifying
the pathogens that cause common infectious diseases. <font color="#dcdcdc">Louis1885
Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux </font>created the first rabies
vaccine in 2000. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914
from a mixture of diphtheria titoxin and antitoxin (prepared from the
serum of a vaccinated animal), but the safety of the vaccine was
marginal and it was not widely used. In 1921, there were 206<font color="#556b2f">,000
</font>cases of diphtheria in the United States206 , resulting in
15<font color="#6b8e23">,520 </font>deaths. In 1923, parallel efforts
by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at
Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to
the production of a safer vaccine by treating diphtheria toxin <font color="#a0522d">with
formaldehyde. </font>In 1944, <font color="#228b22">Maurice Hilleman
of </font>Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Between 1940 and 1955, the US
mortality rate accelerated from 2% to 8% per year and then returned
to its historic rate of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the
immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development
of new treatments and vaccines for infectious diseases that occurred
during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with
the most significant achievement of the period being the development
of the <font color="#a9a9a9">Jonas </font>Salk polio vaccine in 1954,
funded by <font color="#2f4f4f">the </font>non-profit <font color="#2f4f4f">National

never patented, but was instead made available to pharmaceutical
companies for manufacture as a low-cost generic vaccine. In 1960,
<font color="#556b2f">Maurice Hilleman </font>of Merck Sharp &amp;
Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to <font color="#a0522d">cause

found to be a contaminant in batches of polio vaccine given to 90% of

the original cell strain and the monkey tissue used in its
manufacture. In 2004, <font color="#191970">the US Cancer Institute

<font color="#2f4f4f">multinational40 pharmaceutical companies </font>filed
a lawsuit against South Africa over its drug law, which allowed the
generic production of <font color="#556b2f">antiretroviral </font>drugs
to treat HIV, despite the fact that these drugs were patented. HIV
was and still is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs cost between
<font color="#a0522d">USD 10 000 and USD 15 000 </font><font color="#228b22">per
patient per year </font>at the time. This was an unaffordable price
for most South Africans, so the South African government committed
itself to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could
afford. To achieve this, patents on medicines would have to be
ignored and generic medicines would have to be produced in-country
(through compulsory licensing) or imported from abroad. Following
international protests in favour of public health rights (including a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Before the 1900s, medicines were
usually produced by small manufacturers with little control over
their manufacture or claims of safety and efficacy. Where such laws
existed, enforcement was lax. In the United States, regulation of
vaccines and other biological medicines was increased following the
outbreak of tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the spread of
<font color="#a9a9a9">contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria
antitoxin</font>. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Biologics Control Act of
</font>1902 required the federal government to grant prior approval
for each biological drug and the process and facility for
manufacturing such drugs. This was followed by the <font color="#6b8e23">Pure
Food and Drugs </font><font color="#556b2f">1906Act</font>, which
prohibited the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded
food and drugs. A drug was considered adulterated if it contained
alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, or any of a number of other
potentially dangerous or addictive drugs, and if its label did not
indicate the amount or proportion of those drugs. The government's
attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers for making
unsubstantiated claims about their efficacy were unsupported when the
<font color="#a0522d">Supreme Court decision </font>limited federal
enforcement powers to cases where the drug's ingredients were

and develop; of all the compounds tested for use in humans, only a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Depending on a number of factors, a
company can apply for and obtain a patent for a medicine or a process
for manufacturing a medicine, which usually gives exclusivity <font color="#a9a9a9">for
</font>about <font color="#a9a9a9">20 years</font>. However, only
after thorough research and testing, which takes on <font color="#dcdcdc">average
10-15 years, will </font>the authorities authorise the company to
market and sell the medicine. <font color="#2f4f4f">Patent protection
</font>allows the patent owner to recover the costs of research and
development through high profit margins on the branded medicine. When
the patent protection on a medicine expires, a competing company
usually develops and sells a <font color="#556b2f">generic </font>medicine.
Generic drugs are cheaper to develop and approve, so they can be sold
at a lower price. Often, the owner of a branded medicine will launch
<font color="#6b8e23">a generic </font>version before the patent
expires in order to gain an advantage in the generic market.
Restructuring has therefore become routine, due to the expiry of
patents on products launched in the &quot;golden age&quot; of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At the time, some Muslims considered
Umayyad taxation and administrative practices to be unfair.
<font color="#a9a9a9">Christians and Jews </font>retained their
autonomy; their legal affairs were handled by their own religious
leaders or their appointees, according to their own laws, although
they paid a poll tax to the central police force. Muhammad had
explicitly stated in his lifetime that Abrahamic religious groups
(which were still in the majority during the Umayyad caliphate)
should be allowed to practice their own religion provided they paid a
jizya tax. The welfare state for the poor, both Muslim and
non-Muslim, initiated by <font color="#2f4f4f">Umar ibn al Khattab
</font>had also continued. Muawiya's wife <font color="#556b2f">Maysum
</font>(Yazid's mother) was also a <font color="#6b8e23">Christian.</font>
Relations between Muslims and Christians in the state were stable
during this period. The Umayyads often engaged in frequent battles
with Christian Byzantines without concern for their own protection <font color="#a0522d">in
Syria</font>, which had remained largely Christian like many other
parts of the empire. There were <font color="#228b22">Christians in
</font>prominent positions<font color="#228b22">, </font>some of whom
belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The
recruitment of Christians was part of a wider policy of religious
assimilation, necessitated by the large Christian populations in
conquered provinces such as Syria. <font color="#191970">This policy
</font>also increased Muawiya's popularity and consolidated Syria in
his position of power.</p>

Caliphate </font>(Arabic: <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">الخلافة

four </font>major Islamic caliphates established after the death of
Muhammad. The centre of this caliphate was the Umayyad dynasty
(Arabic: <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">الأمويون</span></font>,
al-ʾUmawiyyūn, or <font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">بنو أمية</span></font>,
Banū ʾUmayya, &quot;Sons of Umayya&quot;), which originated from
Mecca. The Umayyad family had first come to power under the third
caliph <font color="#2f4f4f">Uthman ibn Affan </font>(r. 644-656),
but the Umayyad regime was established by the long-time governor of
Syria <font color="#556b2f">Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan </font>after the
end of the first Muslim civil war in <font color="#6b8e23">661 AD/41
AD.</font> Syria remained the main Umayyad stronghold thereafter,
with Damascus as their capital. The Umayyads continued their Muslim
conquests by incorporating the Caucasus, Transoxia, Sindh, the
Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the Muslim world.
At its largest, the Umayyad Caliphate covered 15 <font color="#a0522d">5.79million

Muawiyah661 </font>(-80) as the second ruler of the Umayyad dynasty,
although he was the first to establish the Umayyads' right to rule on
the dynastic principle. Under the caliphate of Uthman Ibn Affan
(644-656), himself a member of the Umayyad clan, the Umayyad clan was
revived and then ascended to the throne of power. <font color="#556b2f">Uthman
</font>placed some trusted members of his clan in prominent and
powerful positions throughout the state. Most notable was the
appointment of Uthman's first cousin <font color="#6b8e23">Marwan ibn
al-Hakam </font>as his senior advisor, which caused a stir among
Muhammad's Hashemite followers, as Marwan and his father al-Hakam ibn
Abi al-'As had been permanently exiled from Medina during Muhammad's
lifetime. Uthman also appointed as governor of Kufa his half-brother
Walid ibn Uqba, whom the Hashemites accused of leading prayer under
the influence of alcohol. Uthman also strengthened Muawiya's rule in
Syria by giving him control over a wider area and appointed his
foster brother Abdullah ibn Saad as governor of Egypt. <font color="#a0522d">However,
</font>as Uthman <font color="#a0522d">never named an heir</font>, he

imprisonment of his family led to a major opposition movement. In

family (also known as <font color="#a9a9a9">Banu Abd-Shams</font>)
and <font color="#dcdcdc">Muhammad </font>were both descended from a
common ancestor, <font color="#2f4f4f">Abd Manaf ibn Qusai, </font>and
originally hailed from <font color="#556b2f">Mecca</font>. Muhammad
was descended from Abd Manaf through his son Hashim, while the
Umayyads were descended from Abd Manaf through another son,
Abd-Shams, whose son was <font color="#6b8e23">Umayya.</font> These
two families are thus considered to be different clans (Hashim and
Umayya) of the same tribe (Quraish). However, <font color="#a0522d">Muslim
Shia historians </font>doubt that Umayya was the adopted son of Abd
Shams, so he was not a blood relative of Abd Manaf ibn Qusai. Umayya
was later expelled from the nobility. <font color="#228b22">Sunni
</font>historians disagree with this and regard the Shiite claims as
nothing more than outright polemics, as they are hostile to the
Umayyad lineage in general. They point out that Uthman's grandsons
Zaid bin Amr bin Uthman bin Affan and <font color="#191970">Abdullah

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After this battle, Ali fought a
battle against <font color="#a9a9a9">Muawiyah</font>, known <font color="#dcdcdc">as
the Battle of Siffin</font>. The battle was stopped before either
side had achieved victory, and the two sides agreed to settle their

ibn al-As </font>as arbitrator<font color="#2f4f4f">, </font>and Ali
appointed <font color="#556b2f">Abu Musa Ashaar.</font> Seven months
later, in February 658, the two arbitrators met at Adhruh, about 15
km northwest of Maan in the Jordan. <font color="#6b8e23">Amr ibn
al-As </font>convinced Abu Musa Ashaar that both Ali and Muawiya
should relinquish power and elect a new caliph. Ali and his
supporters were dismayed by the decision, which had reduced the
caliph to the level of the rebel Muawiyah I. Muawiyah and Amr had
thus tricked Ali. Ali refused to accept the verdict and technically
found himself in breach of his promise to follow arbitration. This
put Ali in a weak position even among his own supporters. The most
vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the very same people who had
forced Ali into a ceasefire. They broke away from Ali's forces and
rallied under the slogan: '<font color="#a0522d">Arbitration belongs
to God alone'. &quot;</font>This group became known as the <font color="#228b22">Kharijites

Utbah and Shaybah) were killed by the Hashemites (Ali, Hamza ibn 'Abd

eradicate the followers of the new religion by fighting another
battle with Muslims living in Medina only a year after the Battle of
Badr. He did this to avenge his defeat at Badr. Scholars generally
believe that <font color="#a0522d">the battle of Uhud </font>was the
first defeat of the Muslims, because they had suffered greater losses
than the Meccans. After the battle, Abu Sufyan's wife <font color="#228b22">Hind</font>,

India. In the Caucasus, the confrontation with the Khazars reached
its peak during the Hisham period: the Arabs established Derbent as
an important military base and launched several invasions of the
North Caucasus, but failed to defeat the Khazar pastoralists. The

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The word asphalt is derived from
<font color="#a9a9a9">late medieval English</font>, which in turn is
derived from the French word asphalte, which is based on the late
Latin word asphalton, asphaltum, which is a Latinisation of the <font color="#dcdcdc">Greek
</font>word ἄσφαλτος (ásphaltos, ásphalton), meaning
&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">asphalt/bitumen/pitch</font>&quot;,
perhaps derived from the words ἀ-, &quot;air&quot;, and σφάλλω
(sfallō), &quot;to pour&quot;. It should be noted that in <font color="#556b2f">French
the </font>term <font color="#6b8e23">asphalte </font>is used <font color="#a0522d">for
naturally occurring bitumen-saturated limestone deposits </font>and
specialised industrial products with fewer pores or a higher bitumen
content than 'asphalt concrete' used for paving roads. Significantly,
asphalt was first used by the ancients as a cement for fixing or
joining various objects together, so it is likely that the name
itself expressed this use. <font color="#228b22">Herodotus </font>mentions
that bitumen was imported into Babylon for the construction of its
gigantic <font color="#191970">fortress wall.</font> From Greece, the

largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one that can
be extracted from the surface, although recent technological
breakthroughs have meant that deeper deposits can be produced in
situ. The rise in oil prices made bitumen production highly
profitable, but the post-20142003 downturn meant that building new
plants was no longer viable. Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen
production averaged around 2.3 million barrels (370 000 m3 ) per day
in 2014 and was forecast to rise to 4.4 million barrels (700 000 m3 )
per day by 2020. The total amount of raw asphalt/bitumen that could

according to some, was originally gwitu-men (<font color="#2f4f4f">pitch-man</font>)
and others pixtumens (oozing or bubbling pitch), which was later
shortened to bitumen, from which it passed via <font color="#556b2f">French

in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, written by 'a Monsieur d'Eyrinys',
states that he had observed (asphalt) in large quantities near
Neufchatel and that he suggested that it be used in various ways -
'chiefly for the construction of airtight granaries and for
protecting the waters of the city of Paris by means of arches against
the ingress of dirt and filth', which at that time made water
unusable. &quot;He also explains the excellence of this material in
forming flat and durable terraces for palaces&quot;, &quot;since the
idea of forming such terraces on the streets probably did not cross
the minds of the Parisian of that generation&quot;. However, it was
generally neglected in France until <font color="#a0522d">the
Revolution of 1830.</font> Then, in the 1830s, interest was aroused
and asphalt began to be widely used 'for pavements, flat roofs and
tank linings, and in England it had been used to some extent for
similar purposes'. The spread of asphalt in Europe was 'a sudden
phenomenon' after natural deposits were found in France 'in Osbann
(Bas-Rhin), Parc (l'Ain) and Puy-de-la-Poix (Puy-de-Dome)', although
it could also be manufactured artificially. One of the earliest uses

court because the presence of King William's bastard children
scandalised her, and perhaps she hastened the emergence of Victorian

sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with <font color="#228b22">her

</font>Victoria's mother died, and Victoria was by her side. <font color="#2f4f4f">Reading
her mother's papers, </font>Victoria discovered that her mother had
loved her deeply; she was heartbroken, and blamed <font color="#556b2f">Conroy
and Lehzen for </font>&quot;maliciously&quot; alienating her from her
mother. To ease his wife's intense and profound grief, <font color="#6b8e23">Albert
</font>took over most of her duties, even though he himself was ill

August, Victoria and Albert visited <font color="#228b22">their son,

exercises </font>near Dublin, and spent a few days on holiday in
Killarney. In November, Albert heard rumours that his son <font color="#8b0000">had
been sleeping with </font><font color="#483d8b">an actress in
Ireland</font>. Horrified, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his
son was studying, and raised the matter. By early December, Albert
was feeling very unwell. William Jenner diagnosed him with <font color="#3cb371">typhoid
fever and </font>he died <font color="#bc8f8f">on 14 December 1861.</font>
Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on concern
for <font color="#008080">the Prince of Wales' womanising</font>. She
said that 'the terrible thing had killed him'. She went into mourning
and wore black for the rest of her life. He avoided public
appearances and rarely visited London in the years that followed. Her

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At the international level, Victoria
was very interested in <font color="#a9a9a9">improving relations
between </font><font color="#dcdcdc">France and Britain</font>. She
organised and hosted several visits between the British royal family
and the <font color="#2f4f4f">House of Orleans</font>, who were
related by <font color="#556b2f">marriage through the Coburgs</font>.
In 1843 and 1845, he and Albert visited <font color="#6b8e23">King
Louis Philippe I </font>at the Château d'Eu in Normandy; he was the
first British or English monarch to visit a Frenchman since Henry
VIII of England and Francis I of France met at the Field of Gold in
1520. When <font color="#a0522d">Louis Philippe </font>made a
reciprocal trip in <font color="#228b22">1844</font>, he became the
first French king to visit a British monarch. Louis Philippe was
deposed in the revolutions of <font color="#191970">1848 </font>and
<font color="#8b0000">fled into exile in England</font>. In April
1848, when fear of revolution was at its height in the United
Kingdom, Victoria and her family left London for the safer refuge of
<font color="#483d8b">Osborne House</font><font color="#3cb371">, a
private estate on the Isle of Wight which </font>she had bought in
1848 and <font color="#bc8f8f">renovated in 1845</font>. The <font color="#663399">Chartist
and Irish nationalist </font>demonstrations were not widely
supported, and fear subsided without major unrest. Victoria's first
<font color="#008080">visit to Ireland </font>in 1849 was a public
relations success, but it had no lasting effect on the growth of
Irish nationalism.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1830, <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Duchess of Kent and Conroy </font>took Victoria across <font color="#dcdcdc">central
England </font>to visit <font color="#2f4f4f">the Malvern Hills</font>,
stopping at towns and grand country houses along the way. Similar

enthusiastically received at every </font>stop. <font color="#191970">William
</font>likened the trips to royal journeys of progress and was
<font color="#8b0000">concerned that they presented Victoria </font><font color="#483d8b">as
his rival </font>rather than his supposed heiress. Victoria <font color="#3cb371">hated
</font>travelling; the constant round of public appearances exhausted
and sickened her, and she had little time for rest. She protested
against it, citing the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed
the King's complaints as jealousy and forced Victoria to continue
travelling. <font color="#bc8f8f">At Ramsgate </font>in October 1835,
Victoria fell ill with a severe fever, which Conroy initially
dismissed as a childish pretense. As Victoria fell ill, Conroy and
the Duchess pressed her unsuccessfully to make Conroy <font color="#008080">her
private secretary. </font>As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent
attempts by her mother and <font color="#bdb76b">Conroy to </font>appoint
her to their staff. After becoming queen, she <font color="#4682b4">forbade
Conroy to be present, </font>but he remained in her mother's

1842, </font>Victoria <font color="#dcdcdc">was riding in a carriage

faster and in a larger convoy, deliberately trying to incite Francis
to aim again and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot him,
but was caught by plainclothes police and convicted of treason. On 3
July, two days after Francis's <font color="#a0522d">death sentence
was commuted </font><font color="#228b22">to life imprisonment</font>,
<font color="#191970">John William Bean </font>also tried to shoot
the Queen with a pistol, but it was loaded only with <font color="#8b0000">paper
and tobacco and was </font>short of ammunition. Edward Oxford felt
that his acquittal in 1840 encouraged the attempts. Bean was
sentenced <font color="#483d8b">to 18 months imprisonment</font>. In
a similar attack in <font color="#3cb371">1849</font>, <font color="#bc8f8f">William
Hamilton, </font>an unemployed Irishman, fired a gunpowder pistol at
a Victoria coach as it passed along Constitution Hill in London. In
1850, the Queen was injured when she was attacked by a possibly
insane former army officer, <font color="#663399">Robert Pate.</font>
While Victoria was travelling in the carriage, Pate struck her with
his cane, smashed her headdress and bruised her forehead. Both
Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years in prison.</p>

Victoria was aware of the various marriage plans and was critical of

in 1870, fuelled by the Queen's isolationism, <font color="#dcdcdc">gained
new momentum </font><font color="#2f4f4f">after the establishment of

<font color="#556b2f">Trafalgar Square </font>called for Victoria's

In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the

the disease believed to have killed his father, and Victoria feared
her son would die. As the <font color="#bc8f8f">tenth anniversary of

and Victoria's anxiety continued. To everyone's delight, the boy
survived. Mother and son attended a public parade in London and a

Anderson </font>drew up the first printed Masonic constitutions,

Freemasonry spread, Continental Freemasons began to include women <font color="#556b2f">in

Minister William Pitt </font>(who was not a Mason) and explained to
him that Masonry was in favour of the law and of a legally
constituted authority, and was heavily involved in charitable work.
As a result, Freemasonry was specifically exempted from the terms of
the Act on condition that the secretary of each private lodge
submitted <font color="#228b22">a list of the members of his lodge
</font>once a year to the local Clerk of the Peace. This continued

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Prince Hall
Freemasonry </font>exists because <font color="#dcdcdc">early
American lodges refused to admit African Americans as members</font>.
In <font color="#2f4f4f">1775</font>, an African American named
Prince Hall was initiated along with fourteen other African Americans
into a British military lodge by proxy from the Grand Lodge of
Ireland because he had failed to gain admission from other Boston
lodges. When the military lodge left North America, these fifteen men
were authorized to meet as lodges, but not to initiate Masons. In
1784, these men received permission from the Grand Lodge of England
(GLE) and founded African Lodge No. 459. When the UGLE was
established in <font color="#6b8e23">1813</font>, all <font color="#a0522d">lodges
in the </font>United States <font color="#a0522d">were removed from
their rolls </font>- largely due to the War of 1812. Consequently,
African Lodge, which had been separated from both the UGLE and all
recognized Grand Lodges in the United States, renamed itself <font color="#191970">African
Lodge, Number 1 </font>- and <font color="#8b0000">became a de facto
&quot;Grand Lodge&quot; </font>(this Lodge should not be confused
with the various Grand Lodges operating on the African continent).
Like the rest of American Freemasonry, Prince Hall Masonry soon grew
and organised itself according to the Grand Lodge system of each
state.</p>

the Church adopted a new Code of Canon Law. Unlike its predecessor,
the 1983 Code of Canon Law did not explicitly mention Masonic
organisations among the secret societies it condemned. It states, &quot;A
person who joins a society which conspires against the Church shall
be punished by just punishment; one who promotes or takes office in
such a society shall be punished by excommunication.&quot; This
exclusion of Masonic associations by name led both Catholics and
Freemasons to believe that the ban on Catholics joining the Masons
had perhaps been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalism of
Vatican II. However, the matter was clarified when <font color="#dcdcdc">Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger </font>(later Pope Benedict XVI), as Prefect of the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a declaration on
Freemasonry, stating that: '... <font color="#2f4f4f">the Church's
negative judgment of Masonic associations remains unchanged</font>,
since their principles have always been considered contrary to the
doctrine of the Church, and therefore membership of them is still
prohibited. Believers who enrol in Masonic societies are in a state
of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion.&quot; Freemasonry<font color="#556b2f">,
on the other hand, has never opposed Catholics joining its
brotherhood. </font><font color="#6b8e23">Grand Lodges </font>friendly

few members of the Church of England would have seen a contradiction

</font>1947, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the
adoption and implementation of the Mandatory Partition Plan for
Palestine. This UN plan defined the borders of the new Arab and
Jewish states and the territory of Jerusalem and its environs, which
was to be administered by the UN under the international system. The
British mandate for Palestine ended <font color="#dcdcdc">at midnight
on 14 May 1948</font>. On that day, <font color="#2f4f4f">David
Ben-Gurion</font>, Executive Director of the Zionist Organisation and
Chairman of the Jewish Agency in Palestine, proclaimed 'the
establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, known as the State
of Israel', which would be operational from the end of the Mandate.
The borders of the new state were not defined in the declaration.
Neighbouring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian Mandate area
the following day and fought Israeli troops. Israel has since fought
several wars with neighbouring Arab states, during which it has
occupied the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula (1956-57, 1967-82), part
of southern Lebanon (1982-2000), the Gaza Strip (1967-2005; still
considered occupied after the 2005 withdrawal) and the Golan Heights.
It has extended its legislation to the Golan Heights and East
Jerusalem, but not to the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict have not led to peace. However, peace
agreements have been signed between Israel and Egypt and Jordan.
Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the
longest military occupation in the world in modern times[note 2].</p>

in 1918. Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led
to the 1920 Palestinian riots and the formation of the Jewish
militia, the Haganah (Hebrew for '<font color="#dcdcdc">defence</font>'),
from which the Irgun and the Lehi, or Stern Gang, paramilitary
groups, later split. In 1922, the League of Nations granted Britain a
mandate to Palestine on terms that included the Balfour Declaration
and its promise to the Jews, and similar provisions for the
Palestinian Arabs. The population of the region was then
predominantly Arab and Muslim, with Jews accounting for about 11% of
the population and Arab Christians for about 9.5%.</p>

persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe eventually led to the fifth
aliya, when a quarter of a million Jews arrived. This was a major
cause of the Arab Revolt of 1936-39, during which British Mandate
authorities and Zionist Haganah and Irgun militias killed 5,032 Arabs
and wounded 14,760, resulting in over 10% of the adult male Arab
population of Palestine being killed, wounded, imprisoned or
deported. The British restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine with
the 1939 White Paper. As countries around the world turned Jewish
refugees away from Jews fleeing the Holocaust, a movement called
Aliyah Bet was secretly organised to bring Jews to Palestine. By the
end of the Second World War, the Jewish population in Palestine had
grown to <font color="#dcdcdc">33% </font>of the total population. On
<font color="#2f4f4f">22 July </font>1946, Irgun attacked the
headquarters of the British Palestine Administration in the south
wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people of
different nationalities and injuring 46. The hotel housed the central
offices of the British Mandate for the Palestinian Authority, mainly
the Palestinian Government Secretariat and the British Armed Forces
Headquarters in Palestine and the Transjordan. The attack was
initially approved by the Haganah (the main Jewish paramilitary group
in Palestine). It was designed in response to Operation Agatha (a
series of large-scale attacks by the British authorities, including
one on the Jewish Agency) and was the deadliest attack on the British

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Education is highly valued in Israel
by the national culture, which has historical values dating back to
ancient Israel and was considered one of the cornerstones of ancient
Israeli life. In Israeli culture, higher education is seen as a key
to higher mobility and socio-economic status in Israeli society. The
emphasis on education in Israeli society stretches back to the divide
within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and the Enlightenment
movement to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in
the Levant were among the first to introduce compulsory education,
where an organised community, no less than the parents, was
responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. The
strong emphasis on contemporary Jewish culture, the promotion of
scholarship and learning, and the strong tendency to encourage
intellectual pursuits, as well as the nation's high rate of
university education, demonstrate the high value that Israeli society
places on higher education. The Israeli education system has been
praised for a variety of reasons, including its high quality and its
important role in driving Israel's economic development and
technological boom. Many international business leaders and
organisations, including Microsoft founder <font color="#a9a9a9">Bill
Gates, </font>have praised the high quality of education in Israel,
which has contributed to Israel's economic development. In 2012,
Israel had the <font color="#dcdcdc">second highest </font>share of
tertiary education graduates aged 25-64 among OECD countries (tied
with Japan and after Canada) at 46%, compared to an OECD average of
32%. In addition, almost twice as many Israelis aged 55-64 had a
tertiary degree as in other OECD countries: 47% had an academic
degree, compared to the OECD average of 25%. In 2012, Israel ranked
<font color="#2f4f4f">third in the </font>world in terms of the
number of academic degrees per capita (20% of the population)<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font></p>

years </font>and a literacy rate of <font color="#dcdcdc">97.1%,
</font>according to the UN. The 1953 State Education Law established
five types of schools: state secular, state religious,
ultra-Orthodox, municipal settlement schools and Arab schools. The
public secular school is the largest category of schools, with the
majority of Israeli Jewish and non-Arab pupils. Most Arabs send their
children to schools where the language of instruction is Arabic.
Education in Israel is compulsory for children aged 3 to 18.
Schooling is divided into three levels - primary school (grades 1-6),
secondary school (grades 7-9) and high school (grades 10-12) - and
ends with the Bagrut examination. The Bagrut certificate requires
proficiency in core subjects such as mathematics, Hebrew, Hebrew
language and literature, English, history, Bible <font color="#2f4f4f">and
social studies.</font> In Arab, Christian and Druze schools, the
Bible test is replaced by a test on Muslim, Christian or Druze
heritage. Christian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in
Israel. Maariv has described the Christian Arab sectors as &quot;the
most successful in the education system&quot; because Christian Arabs
did best in education compared to all other groups educated in
Israel. Israeli children from Russian-speaking families have a higher
pass rate in high school. While among immigrant children born in the
FSU, the pass rate for Bagrut students is highest among families from
the Western FSU countries of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova
(62.6%) and lower among families from the Central Asian and Caucasian
FSU countries. In 2003, more than half of all Israeli twelfth-grade
pupils passed the matriculation examination.</p>

period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) and Mediterranean history between
the death of Alexander the Great (<font color="#a9a9a9">323 BC) </font>and
the birth of the Roman Empire, illustrated by the Battle of Actium in
<font color="#dcdcdc">31 BC </font>and the subsequent conquest of
Egypt by the Ptolemies the following year. During this period,
Greece's cultural influence and power peaked in Europe, Africa and
Asia, achieving wealth and progress in the arts, exploration,
literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy and
science. For example, public competitive games were organised, ideas
were developed in the field of biology and popular entertainment was
organised in theatres. It is often seen as a period of transition,
sometimes even decadence or decay, compared to the Greek Classical
Enlightenment. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Hellenistic </font>period
saw the emergence of the new comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the
Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. <font color="#556b2f">Greek

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After Alexander the Great's
adventures in Persia, Hellenistic kingdoms were established <font color="#a9a9a9">in
south-west Asia </font>(Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamum),
<font color="#dcdcdc">north-east Africa </font>(Kingdom of Ptolemy)
and <font color="#2f4f4f">south Asia </font>(Kingdom of
Greco-Bactria, Kingdom of Indo-Greek). This led to the introduction
of Greek culture and language into these new kingdoms through
Greco-Macedonian colonisation, which extended as far as modern
Pakistan. However, the cultures of the indigenous peoples were
equally influenced by these new empires, adopting local practices
when it was useful, necessary or appropriate. Hellenistic culture
thus represents the assimilation of the ancient Greek world into the
Middle Eastern, Near Eastern and Southwest Asian world, and differs
from earlier Greek attitudes towards 'barbarian cultures'. The
Hellenistic period was characterised by a new wave of Greek
colonisation (as distinct from the 8th-6th century BC), which
established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. These new
cities were made up of Greek colonists from all over the Greek world
and not, as before, from a particular 'mother city'. The main
cultural centres expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes
and the new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and
Acha-Khanum. This intermingling of Greek speakers gave rise to a
common Attic dialect, known as <font color="#556b2f">Koine Greek,
which </font>became the lingua franca throughout the Hellenistic
world.</p>

which event marks the end of the Hellenistic era. The Hellenistic
period can be considered to have ended either with the final conquest
of the Greek heartland by Rome in 146 BC, or with the end of the
Hellenistic period with the conquest of the Greek mainland by Rome in
146 BC. The Hellenic empire may be said to have ended with the final
defeat of the Ptolemaic Empire at the Battle of Actium in <font color="#a9a9a9">31

defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus
attacked Macedonia on two fronts and quickly divided the kingdom.
Demetrios fled with his mercenaries to central Greece and began to
gather support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again
besieged Athens after Athens turned against him, but then concluded a
treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to move to
Asia Minor and wage war against the territories held by Lysimachus in
Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial
success, he was forced to surrender to <font color="#2f4f4f">Seleucus
</font>in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had
conquered Macedonia and Thessaly for himself, found himself at war

refuge in the Seleucid court and had subsequently proclaimed himself
king of Macedonia. Ptolemy was killed when the Gauls invaded
Macedonia in 279. His head was stuck on a spear and the country fell
into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of

compete with the Hellenistic empires, and were usually forced to ally
with one of them to defend themselves and pay tribute to Hellenistic
rulers in return for protection. One example is Athens, which had
been decisively defeated by Antipater in the Lamian War (<font color="#a9a9a9">323-322)

supporting the conservative oligarchy. When Demetrios Poliorcetes

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the division of Alexander's
empire, Seleucus I Nicator was given <font color="#a9a9a9">Babylonia</font>.
From there he created a new empire, which expanded to include much of
Alexander's Middle Eastern territories. At the height of its power,
it included central Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Persia,
present-day Turkmenistan, Pamir and parts of Pakistan. It included a
diverse population estimated at fifty to sixty million people. By the
time of Antiochus I (c. 324/3 - 261 BC), however, this heavy empire
had already begun to lose territory. <font color="#dcdcdc">Eumenes I
</font>broke away from Pergamos <font color="#dcdcdc">and </font>defeated
the Seleucid army sent against him. The kingdoms of Cappadocia,
Bithynia and Pontus were also virtually independent by this time.
Like the Ptolemies, <font color="#2f4f4f">Antiochus I </font>founded
a dynastic religious cult in which he worshipped his father Seleucus
I. Seleucus, who was officially said to be descended from Apollo, had
his own priests and organised monthly sacrifices. The kingdom
continued to decline under Seleucus II, who was forced to wage civil
war (239-236) against his brother <font color="#556b2f">Antiochus
Hieraxius </font>and was unable to prevent the secession of Bactria,
Sogdiana and Parthia. Hierax carved out for himself most of Seleucid
Anatolia, but he and his Galatian allies were defeated by <font color="#6b8e23">Attalus

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Like Egypt, the vast Seleucid Empire
was ruled mostly by a <font color="#a9a9a9">Greco-Macedonian
political elite</font>. The Greek population of the cities, which
formed the ruling elite, was strengthened by emigration from Greece.
These cities included newly established settlements such as Antioch,
the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of
Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained the
traditional Greek institutions of the city-state, such as assemblies,
councils and elected judges, but this was only a facade, as they were
always under the control of Seleucid royal officials. In addition to
these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons
(<font color="#dcdcdc">choria)</font>, military colonies (<font color="#2f4f4f">katoikiai</font>)
and Greek villages (komai), which the Seleucids established
throughout the empire to consolidate their power. This
'Greco-Macedonian' population (including the sons of settlers who had
married local women) could form a 35 000-man phalangi (out of a total
Seleucid army of 80 000 men) under Antiochus III. The rest of the
army was made up of local troops. Antiochus III the Great undertook
several powerful military campaigns to reconquer all the lost
provinces of the empire after the death of Seleucus I. After the
defeat of <font color="#556b2f">Ptolemy IV'</font>s forces at Raphia
(217), Antiochus III led a long campaign eastwards to conquer the
breakaway provinces in the far east (212-205), including Bactria,
Parthia, Ariana, Sogdiana, Gedrosia and Drangiana. He succeeded in
restoring most of these provinces to at least nominal vassalage and
in having their rulers pay taxes on them. After the death of Ptolemy
IV (<font color="#6b8e23">204 </font>), Antiochus took advantage of
Egypt's weakness to conquer Cole-Syria in the Fifth Syrian War
(202-195). He then began to expand his influence into the Pergamene
region of Asia and moved into Europe, fortifying Lysimacia at the
Hellespont, but his expansion into Anatolia and Greece came to an
abrupt halt after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Magnesia (190
BC). In the Treaty of Apamea, which ended the war, Antiochus lost all
his territories in Anatolia west of Taurus and had to pay a large
compensation of 15 000 talents.</p>

where the Frisians depicted Gigantomachy. Pergamum was also the

taxes. This ended when they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince
Antiochus Hierax, who was attempting to overthrow Attalus, ruler of
Pergamum (241-197 BC). Attalus defeated the Gauls severely and forced
them to confine themselves to Galatia. The theme of <font color="#2f4f4f">the

influenced Parthian art. The Parthians continued to worship Greek

gardens in the Hellenistic style. Although the Nabateans initially
worshipped their traditional gods in symbolic form, such as stone
blocks or columns, in the Hellenistic period they began to identify
their gods with the Greek gods and to depict them in figurative forms
inspired by Greek sculpture. Greek influences can be found in
Nabataean art, where paintings depicting Dionysian scenes have been
found. They also slowly adopted Greek as a language of commerce,
alongside Aramaic and Arabic.</p>

the temple in 169 BC after unrest in Judea during his failed invasion
of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rituals and
traditions in Judea. He was perhaps trying to Hellenise the region
and unify his kingdom, and Jewish resistance to this eventually led
to an escalation of violence. Be that as it may, tensions between

rebellion against the Greek overlords, the Hasmonean Empire and the

From 37 BC to 6 AD, the Hellenistic empire was dominated by the Roman
Empire, which was in turn a direct attack on the Greek Empire. The
Herodian dynasty, the Judeo-Roman client kings, ruled Judea. Herod
the Great greatly expanded the temple (see Herod's Temple), making it
one of the largest religious structures in the world. The style of
the enlarged temple and the rest of Herod's architecture shows a
significant Hellenistic architectural influence.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Greek kingdom of Bactria began
as a satrapy separate from the Seleucid kingdom, which, because of
its size, was much freer from central control. Between 255-246 BC.
<font color="#a9a9a9">Diodotus</font>, governor of Bactria, Sogdiana
and Margiana (most of modern Afghanistan), took this process to its
logical conclusion and proclaimed himself king. Diodotos II, the son
of Diodotos II, was deposed around <font color="#dcdcdc">230 BC.
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">Euthydemus</font>, possibly a satrap
from Sogdiana, overthrew Diodotos II and then established his own
dynasty. Around 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian empire was invaded by a
resurgent Seleucid empire led by <font color="#556b2f">Antiochus III.
</font>Although Antiochus won on the ground, he apparently realised
that there were advantages to the status quo (perhaps sensing that
Bactria could not be ruled from Syria) and married one of his
daughters to the son of <font color="#6b8e23">Euthydemus</font>, thus
legitimising the Greco-Bactrian dynasty. Shortly after this, the
Greco-Bactrian empire seems to have expanded, possibly taking
advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.</p>

the Greco-Bactrians seem to have had links with China through the
Silk Road trade routes (Strabo, XI.XI.I). Indian sources also mention
religious links between Buddhist monks and Greeks, and some
Greco-Bactrians converted to Buddhism. Demetrius, son and successor
of Euthydemus, invaded north-west India in <font color="#dcdcdc">180
BC after the </font>destruction of the Mauryan Empire, probably
allied with the Bactrians (and Seleucids). The exact reason for the
invasion is still unclear, but by about 175 BC the Greeks controlled
parts of north-west India. This period also marks the beginning of a
blurring of Greco-Bactrian history. <font color="#2f4f4f">Demetrius
</font>possibly died around 180 BC; numismatic evidence points to the
existence of several other kings shortly afterwards. It is likely
that at this point the Greco-Bactrian empire was divided for a few
years into several semi-independent regions, often at war with each
other. <font color="#556b2f">Heliocles </font>was the last Greek who
clearly ruled Bactria, and his reign collapsed due to invasions by
Central Asian tribes (Scythians and Jezhians) around 130 BC. However,
Greek urban civilisation seems to have continued in Bactria after the
fall of the empire, and had a Hellenising influence on the tribes
that had displaced the Greeks. In the Kushan Empire that followed,
Greek was still used on coins and the Greeks continued to be
influential in the empire.</p>

becoming the vassalage of Mithradates VI, king of Pontus, which
received protection around 107 BC. It later became a client state of
Rome. Other Scythians living in the steppes of Central Asia came into
contact with Hellenistic culture <font color="#556b2f">through the

and some Scythian art shows Greek influences. At least some Scythians
appear to have been Hellenised, as we know of conflicts between the

Greek world was probably inevitable, given the Roman republic's
general way of exercising power. This Roman-Greek interaction began
as a result of the Greek city-states along the coast of southern
Italy. Rome had come to dominate the <font color="#a9a9a9">Italian

control. Although they initially resisted, allied with Epirus Pyrrhus
and defeated the Romans in several battles, the Greek cities were

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At the end of the Second Macedonian
War, the chaos in Greece led to the Seleucid Empire also becoming
embroiled with the Romans. Seleucid Antiochus III had allied himself
with <font color="#a9a9a9">Philip V of </font>Macedonia in 203 BC and
agreed to conquer together the lands of the Egyptian bachelor king
Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy <font color="#dcdcdc">in the Fifth
Syrian War, </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Antiochus </font>concentrated
on conquering the territories held by Ptolemy in Asia Minor. However,
this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two
important Roman allies, and started a 'cold war' between Rome and
Antiochus (not helped by Hannibal's presence at the Seleucid court).
Meanwhile in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided
with Rome against Macedonia, now began to resent the Roman presence
in Greece. This gave Antiochus III an excuse to invade Greece and
'liberate' it from Roman influence, triggering the <font color="#556b2f">Roman-Syrian
War </font>(<font color="#6b8e23">192-188 BC</font>). In 191 BC, the
Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrion defeated Antiochus at
Thermopylae and forced him to retreat to Asia. It was during this war
that Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they
defeated Antiochus again at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). A
crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, removing the Seleucid
territories in Asia Minor and giving them to Rhodes and Pergamos,
reducing the size of the Seleucid navy and demanding massive war
reparations.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In less than twenty years, Rome had
thus destroyed the power of one successor state, crippled another and
consolidated its influence in Greece. This was primarily due to the
over-ambition of the Macedonian kings and their unintentional
provocation of Rome, although Rome was quick to take advantage of the
situation. Twenty years later, the Macedonian Empire was no more.
Philip V's son <font color="#a9a9a9">Perseus, who </font>sought to
consolidate Macedonian power and Greek independence, incurred Roman
wrath, leading to <font color="#dcdcdc">the Third Macedonian War
</font>(171-168 BC). The victorious Romans abolished the Macedonian
kingdom and replaced it with four puppet republics, which lasted
another twenty years before Macedonia was formally incorporated as a
Roman province (<font color="#2f4f4f">146 BC</font>) after a new
revolt led by Andris. Rome now demanded the dissolution of the last
stronghold of Greek independence, the Achaean League. The Achaeans
refused and declared war on Rome. Most Greek cities sided with the
Achaeans, and even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence.
The Roman consul <font color="#556b2f">Lucius Mummius </font>advanced
from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to
the ground. In <font color="#6b8e23">146 BC. </font>The Greek
peninsula, but not the islands, became a Roman protectorate. With the

lasted only a little longer; it was allied with Rome until the end,
but its last king <font color="#a9a9a9">Attalus III </font>died in
<font color="#dcdcdc">133 BC </font>without an heir, and when the

conquered Roman-held Anatolia and slaughtered up to 100 000 Romans
and Roman allies throughout Asia Minor. Many Greek cities, including
Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined Mithridates in
the Mithridates Wars. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman
general Lucius Cornelius Sulla, he besieged Athens and destroyed the
city. Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) finally defeated
Mithridates in 65 BC. Greece was further devastated by the Roman
civil wars, which were fought partly in Greece. In 27 BC. Augustus
finally incorporated Greece directly into the new Roman Empire as the
province of Achaia. The battles with Rome had left Greece empty and
demoralised. However, with Rome's rule, warfare at least came to an
end, and cities such as Athens, Corinth, Thessalonica and Patras soon
regained their prosperity.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In contrast, being so entrenched in
Greek affairs, the Romans completely ignored the rapidly
disintegrating Seleucid Empire (perhaps because it posed no threat)
and allowed the Ptolemaic Empire to quietly decay while acting as a
kind of protector, preventing other powers from invading Egypt
(including the famous &quot;line in the sand&quot; incident when
Seleucid <font color="#a9a9a9">Antiochus IV Epiphanes </font>tried to
invade Egypt). Eventually, the instability in the Middle East caused
by the power vacuum left by the collapse of the Seleucid Empire led
the Roman proconsul <font color="#dcdcdc">Pompey the Great </font>to
abolish the Seleucid body and annex much of Syria to the Roman
Republic. The end of Ptolemaic Egypt was famously the last act in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The spread of Greek culture and
language throughout the Middle East and Asia was largely due to the
development of the newly founded cities of the successor states and a
deliberate policy of colonisation, which in turn was necessary to
maintain their armed forces. Settlements such as Ai-Khanoum, located
along trade routes, allowed Greek culture to mix and spread. The
language of the court and army of Philip II and Alexander (composed

with similar Greek deities, known as &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Interpretatio

temples, and Greek culture in cities also meant that buildings such
as gymnasia and theatres became common. Many cities retained their
nominal autonomy under the local king or satrap, and often had
Greek-style institutions. Greek initiations, statues, architecture
and inscriptions have been found. Local cultures were not replaced,
however, but continued mostly as before, but now with a new
Greco-Macedonian or otherwise Hellenised elite. An example of the
spread of Greek theatre is Plutarch's account of the death of
Crassus, in which Crassus' head was taken to the court of Parthia and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">It seems likely that <font color="#a9a9a9">Alexander
</font>himself pursued policies that led to Hellenisation, such as
the establishment of new cities and Greek colonies. While this may
have been a deliberate attempt to spread Greek culture (or, as Arrian
says, 'to civilise the natives'), it is more likely that it was a
series of pragmatic measures designed to help control his vast
empire. The towns and settlements were centres of administrative
control and Macedonian power in the newly conquered territory.
Alexander also seems to have sought to create a mixed Greco-Persian
elite class, as evidenced by the Susa weddings and the adoption of
some forms of <font color="#dcdcdc">Persian </font>dress and court
culture. He also included Persians and other non-Greek peoples in his
army and even in his elite cavalry. It is probably better to see
these actions as a pragmatic response to the demands of ruling a
large empire than as an ideal attempt to introduce Greek culture to
the 'barbarians'. This approach was bitterly resented by <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Macedonians</font>, and was abandoned by most of the Diadochi after
Alexander's death. This policy can also be interpreted as a result of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Throughout the Hellenistic world,
these Greco-Macedonian colonists generally considered themselves
superior to the original 'barbarians' and excluded most non-Greeks
from the upper levels of court and government. Most of the indigenous
population had not been Hellenised and had little opportunity to
learn about <font color="#a9a9a9">Greek </font>culture, and were
often discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. For example,
secondary schools and their Greek education were <font color="#dcdcdc">for
Greeks </font>only. Greek cities and settlements may have exported
Greek art and architecture as far as Indus, but they were mainly
enclaves of Greek culture for the colonial Greek elite. The influence
of Greek culture throughout the Hellenistic empires was therefore
<font color="#2f4f4f">very localised</font>, based mainly on a few
large cities such as Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives learnt
Greek and adopted Greek customs, but this was mainly limited to a few
local elites allowed by the diadochi to retain their official status,
and a small number of middle-level administrators who acted as
intermediaries between the Greek-speaking upper classes and their
subjects. In the Seleucid Empire, for example, this group constituted
only 1%2<font color="#556b2f">.5 </font>of the civil service.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the Hellenistic period, there was
a lot of continuity in Greek religion: the Greek gods were still
worshipped, and the same rites were still practised as before.
However, the socio-political changes brought about by the conquest of
the Persian Empire and the emigration of the Greeks meant that
religious practices also changed. This varied greatly from place to
place: in Athens, Sparta and most cities on the Greek mainland, there
were few religious changes or new gods (with the exception of the
Egyptian <font color="#a9a9a9">Isis </font>in Athens), while
multi-ethnic Alexandria had a very diverse set of gods and religious
practices, including Egyptian, Jewish and Greek. Greek immigrants
brought their Greek religion everywhere, even as far as India and
Afghanistan. Non-Greeks also had more freedom to travel and trade
throughout the Mediterranean, and in this period we can see Egyptian
gods such as Serapis, and Syrian gods Atargatis and Hadad, as well as
the Jewish synagogue, all living on the island of Delos alongside the
classical Greek deities. The common practice was to identify Greek
gods with native gods who shared similar characteristics, and this
created new fusions such as Zeus-Ammon, Aphrodite <font color="#2f4f4f">Hagne
</font>(Hellenized Atargatis) and Isis-Demeter. Greek immigrants were
faced with individual religious choices that they had not encountered
in their home cities, where the gods worshipped were dictated by
tradition.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The worship of dynastic ruling cults
was also a feature of this period, especially in Egypt, where the
Ptolemies adopted earlier <font color="#a9a9a9">pharaonic </font>practices
and established themselves as god-kings. These cults were usually
associated with a particular temple built in honour of the ruler,
such as the Ptolemies in Alexandria, and had their own festivals and
theatrical performances. The establishment of monarch cults was based
more on systematic tributes to kings (sacrifices, proskynesis,
statues, altars, hymns) which equated them with gods (<font color="#dcdcdc">isotheism)
</font>than on an actual belief in their divine nature. According to
Peter Green, these cults did not produce among the Greeks and
Macedonians a genuine belief in the divinity of their rulers. The
worship of <font color="#2f4f4f">Alexander </font>was also popular,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Hellenistic era also saw a
growing disillusionment with <font color="#a9a9a9">traditional
</font>religion. The rise of philosophy and science had removed the
gods from many traditional areas, such as their role in the movements

</font>proclaimed the centrality of humanity and agnosticism; belief
<font color="#2f4f4f">in euhemerism </font>(the view that the gods

of selfless gods who lived far from the human world in metacosms. The
apotheosis of the rulers also brought the idea of a deity <font color="#6b8e23">on

considerably, it was mostly confined to the educated classes.</p>

survived in its entirety. The plots of this new Hellenistic comedy of
manners were domestic and formulaic, stereotypical characters of low
birth such as slaves took on a more important role, the language was
colloquial, and the main motifs were escape, marriage, romance and
happiness (Tyche). Although no Hellenistic tragedies have survived
intact, they were still widely produced during this period, but it

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hellenistic poets now sought the
patronage of <font color="#a9a9a9">kings </font>and wrote works in
their honour. Scholars in the libraries of Alexandria and Pergamon
concentrated on collecting, cataloguing and literary criticism of
classical Athenian works and ancient Greek myths. The poet-critic
<font color="#dcdcdc">Kallimachus</font>, a staunch elitist, wrote
hymns equating Ptolemy II with Zeus and Apollo. He promoted short
poetic forms such as the epigram, epyllion and iambus, and attacked
epic poetry for being low and commonplace ('big book, big evil' was
his doctrine). He also wrote a massive catalogue of the material in
the Library of Alexandria, the famous <font color="#2f4f4f">Pinakes.</font>
Kallimachus was very influential in his time and also in the
development of Augustan poetry. Another poet, <font color="#556b2f">Apollonius
of Rhodes</font>, tried to revive the epic for the Hellenistic world
with his novel Argonautica. He had been a pupil of Callimachus and
later became the chief librarian (prostates) of the Library of
Alexandria. Apollonius and Callimachus spent much of their careers at
odds with each other. Pastoral poetry also flourished in the
Hellenistic period, and Theocritus was a major poet who popularised
the genre.</p>

with its many schools of philosophy, remained the centre of
philosophical thought. However, Athens had now lost its political
freedom, and Hellenistic philosophy reflected this new difficult
period. In this political climate, Hellenistic philosophers sought
goals such as ataraxia (<font color="#dcdcdc">freedom from
disturbance</font>), autarchy (<font color="#2f4f4f">self-sufficiency</font>)
and apatheia (<font color="#556b2f">freedom from suffering), which
would </font>enable them to wrest the most difficult twists and turns

share this preoccupation with the inner life, personal inner freedom

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Epicureans and Cynics rejected
public office and civil service, which meant rejecting polis-politics
itself, the institution that defined the Greek world. <font color="#a9a9a9">Epicurus
</font>advocated atomism and asceticism, the ultimate goal of which

<font color="#dcdcdc">Diogenes of Sinopea </font>rejected all
material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and
useless. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Kyleenics</font>, on the other
hand, advocated hedonism and argued that pleasure was the only true
good. Stoicism, founded by <font color="#556b2f">Zeno of Citium,
</font>taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia because it
enabled man to live in accordance with nature, or logos. Zeno became
very popular, and the Athenians erected a golden statue to him, and
Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The
philosophical schools of Aristotle (Lyceum Peripatetics) and Plato
(Academy Platonism) also continued to be influential. The Academy
eventually turned to Academic Scepticism under Arcesilaus until
<font color="#6b8e23">Antiochus of Ascalon </font>(c. 90 BC )
abandoned it in favour of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy had a
major influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Demetrios
Phaleron, the Athenian ruler who had studied at the Lyceum, Cleomenes
III, King of Sparta, who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos
Borysthenes, and Antigonus II, also a well-known Stoic. This can also
be said of the Roman upper class, where Stoicism was prevalent, as is

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hellenistic warfare was a
continuation of the military development of Ificrates and Philip II
of Macedonia, especially the use of <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Macedonian falang</font>, a dense formation of spearmen together with
heavy cavalry. Hellenistic armies differed from those of the
classical period in that they were largely composed of professional
soldiers, and also in that they were more specialised and technically
skilled in siege warfare. The armies of the Hellenistic period were
considerably <font color="#dcdcdc">larger </font>than those of
Classical Greece and relied increasingly on Greek mercenaries
(misthophoroi; paid men) and also on non-Greek soldiers such as
Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were
known for their fighting skills in a particular form of combat and
were highly sought after, such as the Tarantino cavalry, Cretan
archers, Rhodian throwers and Thracian peltasts. This period also saw
the introduction of new weapons and troop types, such as the
Thureophores and Thorakitai, who wore the oval Thureos shield and
fought with spears and the machaira sword. The Seleucids,
Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and Pontus adopted heavily armoured
cataphracts and also horse archers. The use of war elephants also
became widespread. Seleucus obtained Indian war elephants <font color="#556b2f">from
the Mauryan Empire and </font>used them effectively in the battle of
Ipsus. He maintained a nucleus of 500 elephants in Apameia. The
Ptolemies used smaller <font color="#6b8e23">African </font>elephants.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hellenistic military equipment was
generally characterised by an increase in size. The warships of the
Hellenistic period grew from triremes to have more oars and more
oarsmen and soldiers, as in quadriremes and quinqueremes. The
<font color="#a9a9a9">Ptolemy's Tessarakonteres </font>was the
largest ship built in antiquity. During this period, new siege
engines were developed. An unknown engineer developed the torsion
spring catapult (c. 360), and <font color="#dcdcdc">Dionysius of
Alexandria </font>designed a repeating <font color="#2f4f4f">ballista</font>,
the Polybolos. Surviving examples of ball missiles range from 4.4 kg
to 78 kg (or over 170 lbs). Demetrios Poliorcetes was famous for the
large siege engines he used in his campaigns, particularly during <font color="#556b2f">the
12-month </font>siege of Rhodes, when he had the Athenian Epimachus
build a massive <font color="#6b8e23">160-ton </font>siege tower
called Helepolis, which was loaded with artillery.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hellenistic art turned from the
idealistic, perfect, calm and tonal figures of classical Greek art to
a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (<font color="#a9a9a9">pathos</font>)
and character (<font color="#dcdcdc">ethos)</font>. The motif of
art's deceptive realistic naturalism (aletheia) can be seen, for
example, in the stories of the painter <font color="#2f4f4f">Zeuxis,
who </font>was said to have painted grapes that looked so real that
birds came to peck at them. Female nudes also became more popular,
such as <font color="#556b2f">Aphrodite in Praxiteles' Cnidus, and
</font>art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and
Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were
sensuality and <font color="#6b8e23">passion</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hellenistic art depicted people of
all ages and from different social backgrounds. Artists like
<font color="#a9a9a9">Peiraikos </font>chose everyday and lower-class
subjects for their paintings. According to Pliny, 'he painted
barbers' shops, shoemakers' stalls, donkeys, food and other similar
subjects, earning himself the name rhyparographos [painter of the
dirty/lowly]. He could give perfect pleasure from these subjects, and
sold more of them than other artists did for their large pictures'
(Natural History, Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Galatians, </font>were depicted in heroic forms, foreshadowing the
artistic theme of the noble savage. The image of <font color="#2f4f4f">Alexander
the Great </font>was also an important artistic theme, and all
diadochi were allowed to depict themselves in imitation of
Alexander's youthful appearance. Many of the most famous works of
Greek sculpture belong to the <font color="#556b2f">Hellenistic

<font color="#dcdcdc">Pliny the Elder, </font>describing the
sculpture of the classical period, says: Cessavit deinde ars ('then

sometimes referred to as Baroque and Rococo in the 17th century. The

discoveries, such as the tombs of <font color="#556b2f">Vergina</font>,
allow a better appreciation of the artistic richness of this period.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The focus of scholars and historians
on the Hellenistic period during the 19th century has led to a common
problem when studying historical periods: historians see the period
of concentration <font color="#a9a9a9">as a mirror image of </font>the
period in which they live. Many 19th century scholars argued that the
Hellenistic period represented a cultural decline from the glory of
classical Greece. Although this comparison is now considered <font color="#2f4f4f">unfair
</font>and irrelevant, it has been argued that even commentators of
the time saw the end of a cultural period for which there was no
longer any opposition. This may be inextricably linked to the nature
of the regime. Herodotus has noted that after the establishment of
democracy in Athens:</p>

Moses Hadas presented an optimistic picture of cultural synthesis

and 1970s, had a materialist approach to the Hellenistic period,
focusing mainly on class relations. More recently, however, the
papyrologist <font color="#6b8e23">C. Préaux </font>has focused
mainly on the economic system, the interactions between kings and
cities, and has presented a generally pessimistic view of the period.
Peter Green, for his part, writes from the perspective of late 20th

millions of children from preventable diseases</font>. However,
according to a 2007 Los Angeles Times study, there are three major
unintended consequences of the Foundation's aid distribution. First,
sub-Saharan Africa was already suffering from a shortage of primary
care doctors before the Gates Foundation came along, but &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Gates
grantees have increased the demand for specially trained and
higher-paid doctors, resulting in a lack of access to primary care in

However, Gates grantees have </font>given most of their grants to
fight high-profile killers such as AIDS. This &quot;brain drain&quot;
will add to the current shortage of doctors and take extra trained
staff away from children and others suffering from common diseases.
Secondly, <font color="#a0522d">&quot;the focus on a few diseases has
overlooked </font><font color="#228b22">basic needs such as nutrition
and transport</font>&quot;. Third, &quot;Gates-funded vaccination

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">&quot;Poultry&quot; is the term used
for all types of domestic birds that have been bred in captivity for
commercial use, and has traditionally been used to refer to wild
birds (Galliformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes). 'Poultry' can be
defined as domestic birds, including chickens, turkeys, geese and
ducks, reared for the production of meat or eggs, and is also used to
refer to the meat of these birds used for food. The Encyclopædia
Britannica lists the same groups of birds, but also includes <font color="#a9a9a9">guinea
fowl </font><font color="#dcdcdc">and pigeons (young pigeons). </font><font color="#556b2f">R.
D. </font>Crawford's <font color="#6b8e23">Poultry breeding and
genetics omits </font>pigeons, but adds Japanese quail and pheasants,
the latter of which <font color="#228b22">are often bred in captivity
and released into the wild. In </font>his classic 1848 book on
poultry, <font color="#191970">Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their
History, and Management</font>, <font color="#8b0000">Edmund Dixon
</font>included chapters on <font color="#483d8b">peacocks, guinea
fowl, swans, turkeys, various geese, musk geese, other ducks and all
types of chickens, including chicks</font>. In common parlance, the
term 'chicken' is often used almost synonymously with 'domestic fowl'
(<font color="#3cb371">Gallus gallus) </font>or 'poultry' or even
just 'bird', and <font color="#bc8f8f">in many languages no
distinction is made between 'poultry' and '</font><font color="#663399">chicken'.</font>
Both words are also used for the meat of these birds. Poultry can be
distinguished from &quot;game&quot;, which is defined as wild birds
or mammals that are hunted for food or sport, and is also used to
describe their meat when eaten.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Chickens </font>are
medium-sized, large birds with an upright posture, characterised by
fleshy red combs and gull-like lobes on their heads. The males,
called <font color="#dcdcdc">cocks, </font><font color="#2f4f4f">are
usually larger, more colourful and more exaggeratedly plumaged than
the females (hens). </font><font color="#556b2f">Chickens</font> are

</font><font color="#191970">domestic chickens (Gallus gallus
domesticus) are descended mainly from </font><font color="#8b0000">the

jungle fowl. <font color="#483d8b">Domestication </font>is thought to

ago, and </font><font color="#bc8f8f">fossil chicken bones </font>dating
back to around 5 400 BC have probably been found in north-east China.
Archaeologists believe that domestication originally took place for
cockfighting, as the male bird was a brave fighter. Chickens seem to
have reached the <font color="#663399">Indus Valley </font>4 000
years ago, and 250 years later they arrived in Egypt. They were still
used for fighting and were seen as symbols of fertility. The Romans
used them for divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when
they mastered the difficult technique of artificial burial. Since
then, chicken keeping has spread around the world for food
production, and domestic chickens are a valuable source of both eggs
and meat.</p>

birds that produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a

Flanders and Brabant used dietsc, while in the northern Netherlands
diets or duutsc was used. It was derived from the old Germanic word
<font color="#a9a9a9">theudisk</font>, which was one of the first
names used in Western Europe for languages other than Romance and
which meant the name of a people (associated with a language), i.e.
the original Germanic language. The term was used in contrast to
<font color="#dcdcdc">Latin</font>, which was the non-original
language of the Scriptures and the Catholic Church. In the first text

all the West Germanic language variants from the mouth of the Rhine
to the Alps were accustomed to refer to their mother tongue as
dietsch, (Neder)duyts or some other cognate of theudisk. This
inevitably led to confusion, as similar terms referred to different
languages. Therefore, in the 1500s, a differentiation took place<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font>
Due to the commercial and colonial competition in the Netherlands in

century, but it came into competition with the more popular term

reasons. One was that it reflected the difference with <font color="#2f4f4f">Hoogduits</font>,

Antwerp in 1585, the Spanish army fell: many fled to the northern
Netherlands, where the Dutch Republic declared its independence from
Spain. They particularly influenced the urban deprivation of the

language was taken with the creation of the <font color="#6b8e23">Statenvertaling</font>,

people throughout the new republic. It used elements from various

half of the Belgian population spoke a Dutch dialect. During the 19th
century, the Flemish movement defended the rights of Dutch, which was
mostly called Flemish. But in competition with French, dialect
variation was a serious handicap. Because standardisation is a long
process, Dutch-speaking Belgium joined the standard language already
developed in the Netherlands over the centuries. The situation in
Belgium is therefore not fundamentally different from that in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In different dialects, there are
many phonetic transitions between vowels (even between diphthongs and
monophthongs), and in some cases the pronunciation of consonants also
changes. For example, the oddity of West-Western (and to a lesser
extent East-Western) is that the phonetic velar fricative (spelled
&quot;g&quot; in Dutch) changes to a phonetic glottal fricative
(spelled <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;h&quot; in </font>Dutch), while
in West-Western the &quot;h&quot; becomes mute (as in <font color="#dcdcdc">French).</font>
When West Flemish people try to speak standard Dutch, they often
cannot pronounce the g sound, but pronounce it like the h sound. For
example, there is no difference between '<font color="#2f4f4f">held</font>'
(hero) and '<font color="#556b2f">geld</font>' (money). Or in some
cases they are aware of the problem and correct the 'h' into a

again with no difference.</p>

there are plenty of examples of suffix differences. Often these are
simple suffix shifts (such as switching between -the, -ske, -ke, -je,
...), but sometimes suffixes even depend on the very specific
grammatical rules of a particular dialect. West Flemish is another
example. In that language, the words '<font color="#a9a9a9">and</font>'
(yes) and '<font color="#dcdcdc">nee</font>' (no) are also conjugated
to the (often implicit) <font color="#2f4f4f">subject of </font>a

However, the Indonesian language has inherited many words from Dutch:
everyday words as well as scientific and technical terms. One scholar
claims that 20% of Indonesian words are derived from Dutch words,
many of which have been transliterated to match the pronunciation.
For example, kantoor (Dutch for 'office') is <font color="#dcdcdc">kantor
in </font>Indonesian, while bus ('bus') is bis. In addition, many
words in Indonesian are Dutch <font color="#2f4f4f">calcasations</font>,

of Dutch <font color="#556b2f">ziekenhuis </font>(literally 'house

is a calcasation of dierentuin (literally 'zoo') and undang-undang

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Dutch vocabulary is mainly of
Germanic origin, with loanwords accounting for <font color="#a9a9a9">20%</font>.
The main foreign influence on Dutch vocabulary since the 13th century
and culminating in the French period has been <font color="#dcdcdc">French
</font>and (Northern) French, which account for an estimated 6.8%, or
more than a third of all loanwords. <font color="#2f4f4f">Latin,
which </font>has been spoken for centuries in the south of the
Netherlands and has played a major role as a language of science and
religion for centuries since, follows with 6.1%, followed by the
influential Upper German and Low German, which until the mid-19th
century accounted for <font color="#556b2f">2.7%, </font>but are
mostly unrecognisable because many German loanwords have been
converted into 'Dutch', for example German 'Fremdling' has become
Dutch 'vreemdeling'. From English, Dutch has been borrowing words
since the mid-19th century, as a result of the rise of Britain and
the United States. English loanwords account for about 1.5% of the
total, but the number is still growing. By contrast, <font color="#6b8e23">Dutch
has </font>introduced a large number of loanwords into English,
accounting for 1.3%.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Dutch is written in Latin
characters. In addition to the standard alphabet, Dutch uses <font color="#a9a9a9">one
</font>additional character, the <font color="#dcdcdc">digraph </font>IJ.
Dutch has a relatively high number of <font color="#2f4f4f">double
letters</font>, both vowels and consonants, due to the formation of
compound words and also due to the spelling methods used to
distinguish the many vowel sounds in Dutch. An example of five
consecutive double letters is the word <font color="#556b2f">voorraaddoos
</font>(food container). Deres (Dutch: trema) is used to denote
vowels that are pronounced separately when accompanied by a prefix or
suffix. While the hyphen is used when this problem occurs in compound
words. For example; 'beïnvloed' (affected), but zee-eend (seagull).
Other diacritical marks usually only occur in loanwords, although
<font color="#6b8e23">acute accents </font>can also be used to
emphasise or distinguish between two forms. It is most commonly used
to distinguish between the indefinite article 'een' (a, an) and the
numeral 'één' (one).</p>
