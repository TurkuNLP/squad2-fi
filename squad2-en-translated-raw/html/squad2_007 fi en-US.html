vibrational spectroscopy </font>(also known as near-infrared
spectroscopy) is a technique for identifying molecules by analysing
the bonds they form. Each chemical bond in a molecule oscillates at a
frequency specific to that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g.
CH2) can have <font color="#dcdcdc">several </font>modes of vibration
due to <font color="#2f4f4f">the stretching and bending movements of
the whole group. </font>If the vibration leads to a change in the
dipole of the molecule, <font color="#556b2f">it absorbs a photon
with the same frequency. </font>The vibrational frequencies of most
molecules correspond to <font color="#6b8e23">the frequencies of
</font><font color="#a0522d">infrared light. </font>Typically, the
technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation in
the range 4000-400 cm-1, i.e. <font color="#228b22">mid-infrared.</font>
The spectrum of all absorption frequencies of the sample is recorded.
This provides information on the composition of the sample in terms
of the chemical groups it contains and its purity (for example, a wet
sample shows a broad O-H absorption at around <font color="#191970">3200
cm-1</font>).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Biodiversity,
</font>short for &quot;biological diversity&quot;, refers to the
diversity and variability of life on Earth in general. One of the
most commonly used definitions defines it as variation within
species, between species and between ecosystems. It measures the
diversity of organisms found in different ecosystems. It can refer to
<font color="#dcdcdc">genetic variation, ecosystem variation or
species variation </font>(number of species) within a region, biome
or planet. <font color="#2f4f4f">Terrestrial </font><font color="#556b2f">biodiversity
</font>tends to be higher near the equator, which appears to be due
to the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is
not evenly distributed across the globe. It is <font color="#6b8e23">most
abundant </font><font color="#a0522d">in the tropics. </font>Marine
biodiversity is highest <font color="#228b22">along the western
Pacific coast, where </font>sea surface temperatures are highest, and
in the mid-latitude bands of all oceans. There are latitudinal scales
of biodiversity. Biodiversity is generally concentrated in hotspots
and has increased over time, but is likely to slow down in the
future.</p>

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) </font>for <font color="#2f4f4f">the

was as follows: 'Biodiversity is the diversity of life forms... at

population, species and ecosystem levels)...&quot;. At the <font color="#556b2f">1992
United Nations </font>Earth Summit, &quot;biodiversity&quot; was
defined as &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">the variability of living
organisms from all sources</font>, including, inter alia,
terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological
complexes of which they are part: this includes intraspecies,
interspecies and ecosystem diversity&quot;. This definition is used

growth. Similarly, the <font color="#6b8e23">hyperbolic nature of

diversity and the complexity of the community structure. The
similarity between the biodiversity and human population curves is
probably due to the fact that both result from the interaction

Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America, where it
collapsed by 83%. In high-income countries, biodiversity increased by
10%, but in low-income countries the loss was reversed. This is
despite the fact that high-income countries use five times more
ecological resources than low-income countries, which was explained
by the process whereby rich countries outsource resource depletion to
poor countries, which suffer the greatest ecosystem losses.</p>

are more resilient and better able to withstand invasive plants and
animals. An important question is &quot;do alien species cause
extinctions?&quot;. Many studies mention the effects of invasive
species on native species, but not extinctions. Invasive species
appear to increase local diversity (i.e. alpha diversity), which
reduces diversity turnover (i.e. beta diversity). Overall gamma
diversity may be reduced because species become extinct from other
causes, but even some of the most insidious invasive species (e.g.
Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North
America) have not caused the extinction of their hosts. Much more
common is the loss of regional biodiversity, population decline and
homogenisation. Human activities have often been responsible for the
circumvention of barriers by introducing alien species for food and
other purposes. Human activity can therefore allow species to move
into new areas (and thus become alien species) in a much shorter time
than it has historically taken to expand their range.</p>

Evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science shows that the
decline in pharmaceutical production since the mid-1980s is due to a
shift away from bioprospecting in favour of genomics and synthetic
chemistry, and claims about the value of undiscovered drugs do not
necessarily encourage companies to seek them on the open market
because of the high cost of development. Marine ecosystems are
particularly important, although inappropriate bioprospecting can
increase biodiversity loss and violate the laws of the communities
and states from which the resources are taken.</p>

In particular, the machine-specific specifications of Teletype Model
33 codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3,
also known as XOFF) and 127 (Delete) became de facto standards. Model
33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (BEL,
meaning to alert the operator with a beep) literally, since the
device contained the correct bell to ring when it received the BEL
signal. Since the O key also had a left arrow symbol at the top of
the key (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of an
underscore), many early timesharing systems also used the <font color="#6b8e23">code
15 (Control-O, Shift In), which was </font>non-compliant and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many non-alphanumeric characters are
positioned to reflect their shifted location on typewriters; an
important subtle feature is that they were based on mechanical
typewriters, not electric typewriters. Mechanical typewriters
followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (<font color="#a9a9a9">1878</font>),
the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of the
23456789- character 23456789- were &quot;#$%_&amp;'() - early
typewriters omitted 0 and 1 and <font color="#dcdcdc">used O (capital
o) and l (small L) instead</font><font color="#2f4f4f">, </font>but
the 1! and 0) pairs became the standard as 0 and 1 became more
common. In ASCII, !&quot;#$% was thus placed in the second column, on
lines 1-5, corresponding to the numbers 1-5 in the adjacent column.
However, 9 and 0 could not be matched in parentheses, because the
space corresponding to 0 was reserved for a space character. This was
solved by removing the _ (underscore) from the number 6 and moving
the remaining characters to the left, in line with the practice of
many European typewriters of placing brackets between the numbers 8
and 9. This difference from typewriters led to bit-parity keyboards,
notably the Teletype Model 33<font color="#556b2f">, which used a
left-shifted layout similar to ASCII, rather </font>than traditional
mechanical typewriters. Electronic typewriters, notably the recently
introduced IBM Selectric typewriter (1961), used a slightly different
layout which has become standard in computers - with the IBM PC
(1981) and especially the Model M (1984) - and so the symbol
transposition values on modern keyboards <font color="#6b8e23">do not
correspond as closely to </font>the ASCII table as on earlier
keyboards. A pair of /? also originates from No. 2, and the pairs ,&lt;
.&gt; were used on some keyboards (others, including No. 2, did not
carry the characters , (comma) or . (dot), so they could be used with
uppercase letters without any carry). However, ASCII split the ;:
pair (from No 2 onwards) and rearranged the mathematical symbols
(with varying conventions, commonly -* =+) as :* ;+ -=.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the human digestive system, food
enters the mouth, and mechanical digestion of food begins through
<font color="#a9a9a9">mastication (chewing)</font>, a form of
mechanical digestion, and wetting contact with saliva. Saliva, the
<font color="#dcdcdc">fluid secreted by the salivary glands</font>,
contains <font color="#2f4f4f">salivary amylase</font>, the enzyme
that initiates the digestion of starch in food; saliva also contains
mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which
provides the ideal pH (alkaline) conditions for amylase to function.
After chewing and digestion of the starch, the food is in the form of
a <font color="#556b2f">small, round slurry mass </font>called a
bolus. It then passes through the oesophagus into the stomach by
<font color="#6b8e23">peristalsis.</font> The gastric juice in the
stomach triggers the digestion of proteins. The gastric juice
contains mainly hydrochloric acid and pepsin. Because these two
chemicals can damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted from the
stomach, forming a slimy layer that acts as a barrier against the
damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time as protein
digestion takes place, mechanical mixing occurs through peristalsis,
which is the waves of muscle contractions that move along the stomach
wall. In this way, the food mass is further mixed with digestive
enzymes.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There are different stages of
digestion, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">the main acid phase, the
gastric phase and the intestinal phase</font>. The cephalic phase
occurs <font color="#dcdcdc">from the sight, thought and smell of
food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. </font>Taste and smell
stimuli are sent to <font color="#2f4f4f">the hypothalamus and
obliterated by the medulla.</font> It is then directed through the
vagus nerve and releases acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this
stage increases to 40% of the maximum rate. Food does not buffer
gastric acidity at this stage, so it inhibits parietal (secretes
acid) and G-cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D-cell somatostatin
secretion. The gastric phase lasts <font color="#556b2f">3-4 hours.
</font>It is stimulated by <font color="#6b8e23">gastric dilation,
the presence of food in the stomach and a drop in pH</font>. Gastric
dilation activates the long and myenteric reflexes. This activates
the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates further gastric fluid
release. When protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions,
which raises the pH of the stomach. The inhibition of gastrin and
gastric acid secretion is removed. This triggers G cells to release
gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric
acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which
lowers the pH to the desired pH 1-3. Acid release is also triggered
by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase has two parts,
excitatory and inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the
duodenum. This triggers the release of intestinal gastrin. The
enterogastric reflex inhibits vagus cytokines, activates sympathetic
fibres that cause the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more
food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In <font color="#a9a9a9">2006</font>,
the FIG introduced a new points system for artistic gymnastics, where
points are no longer limited to 10 points. The system is used in the
United States for elite level competitions. Unlike the old scoring
system, the system has two separate scores, a <font color="#2f4f4f">performance
score </font><font color="#dcdcdc">and a </font><font color="#556b2f">difficulty
score</font>. In the previous system, the &quot;performance score&quot;
was the only score. It was and still is 10,00. During a gymnast's
performance, the judges deduct only this score. A fall, on or off the
event, is a <font color="#228b22">deduction of1</font><font color="#a0522d">.00
</font>in elite level <font color="#228b22">gymnastics.</font> The
introduction of difficulty points is a significant change. A
gymnast's difficulty score is based on the <font color="#191970">elements
he or she performs and </font>may change if he or she does not
perform or performs all the skills, or if he or she does not combine
a skill that is intended to be combined with another skill.
<font color="#8b0000">Connection bonuses </font>are the most common
deduction from the difficulty score because of the difficulty of
combining multiple flight elements. Combining skills is very
difficult if the first skill is not performed correctly. With the new
points code, gymnasts can receive higher points based on the
difficulty of the skills performed as well as their performance.
There is no maximum number of points for difficulty, but it can
increase continuously as the difficulty of the skills increases.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the past, the floor technique was
performed <font color="#a9a9a9">on bare floors or mats, such as
wrestling mats</font>. Today, flooring is performed <font color="#dcdcdc">on
a 12 m × 12 m square covered with a mat, usually consisting of rigid
foam over a layer of plywood and </font>supported <font color="#2f4f4f">by
springs or foam blocks</font>, <font color="#2f4f4f">usually called a
&quot;sprung floor&quot;. </font>This <font color="#556b2f">provides
a solid surface that provides extra bounce or springiness when
compressed, </font>allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a
smoother landing after an assembled skill. Gymnasts perform a
choreography of <font color="#6b8e23">up to </font><font color="#a0522d">90
seconds in </font>a floor gymnastics event; depending on their level,
they can choose their own, or if they are known as &quot;compulsory
gymnasts&quot;, default music must be played. In some gymnastics
federations, such as the United States Association of Gymnastic Clubs
(USAIGC), gymnasts are allowed to use a song for their music, but in
US gymnastics competitions, using a song for music results in <font color="#228b22">a
large deduction from the score.</font> The routine should consist of
tumbling lines, jumping jacks, jumps, dance elements, acrobatic
skills and turns, or pivots, on one leg. A gymnast can perform up to
four tumbling lines, usually including at least one unassisted flight
element. At each level of gymnastics, the athlete must perform a
different number of tumbling movements. At level 7 in the United
States, <font color="#191970">a gymnast is required to </font>perform

Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992

Ronald Koeman. They also won the Copa del Rey in 1990, the European

Barcelona had a long history of avoiding corporate sponsorship on
their jerseys. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five-year

the use of the UNICEF logo on its jerseys. Under the agreement, the

created in 1994 at the proposal of the then Chairman of the Club's
Finance Committee, <font color="#556b2f">Jaime Gil-Aluja</font>. The
idea was to create a foundation that could attract <font color="#6b8e23">financial
sponsors </font>to support a non-profit sporting enterprise. In 2004,
the company could become one of 25 &quot;honorary members&quot; by
paying between GBP 40 000 and 60 000 (GBP 54 800 and 82 300) a year.
There are also 48 associate memberships at an annual cost of £14 000
(£19 200) and an unlimited number of &quot;patron memberships&quot;
at £4 000 (£5 500) per year. It is unclear whether honorary members
have a formal say in club policy, but, according to author Anthony

least some informal influence on the club'.</p>

were the same as those of the Merchant Taylor's School team.
According to author Toni Strubell, another explanation is that the

Gaal was hardly noticed by fans when compared to the departure of the

Catalans considered him one of their own. Barcelona fans, however,
were shocked by Figo's decision to move to arch-rivals <font color="#a9a9a9">Real
Madrid, </font>and on subsequent visits to the Camp Nou Figo received
a very <font color="#dcdcdc">hostile </font>reception. On his first
return, he was pelted with a pig's head and a full bottle of whisky
from the crowd. For the next three years the club was <font color="#2f4f4f">in
decline</font>, with managers coming and going. Van Gaal was replaced
by Llorenç Serra Ferrer, who despite a massive investment in players
in the summer of 2000, led a mediocre league season and a humiliating
Champions League first round exit, and was eventually sacked towards
the end of the season. He was replaced by long-serving coach Carles
Rexach, initially on an interim basis, and managed to guide the club
to at least a final Champions League place on the last day of the
season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good Champions League
semi-final place, Rexach was never considered a long-term solution,

season as manager. What followed was one of the worst La Liga
campaigns in the club's history, although they again performed well
in the Champions League, finishing as high as <font color="#556b2f">15th

Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club chairman <font color="#6b8e23">Joan

such a disastrous season had not only made the club worse in general,

</font>2007, the Washington Post published excerpts from UCLA
professor Amy Zegart's book <font color="#dcdcdc">Spying Blind: The
CIA, the FBI, and the Origins of 9/11</font>. The Post reported from
Zegart's book that government documents show that the CIA and FBI
missed potential23 opportunities to prevent the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks. Key reasons for the failures included: agency
cultures resistant to change and new ideas, inappropriate promotion
incentives, and a lack of cooperation between <font color="#556b2f">the
FBI, CIA </font>and the rest of the US intelligence community. The
book blamed the <font color="#6b8e23">FBI's decentralized structure
for </font>preventing <font color="#a0522d">effective communication
</font>and cooperation between the various FBI offices. The book
suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective
counterterrorism or counterintelligence agency, largely due to a
deep-seated resistance to change in the agency culture. For example,
FBI personnel practices continue to treat all non-special agents <font color="#228b22">as
support staff</font>, and intelligence analysts are classified
alongside FBI auto mechanics and janitors.</p>

project </font>to upgrade its outdated IT infrastructure in 2000. The
project, originally planned to take three years and cost about $380
million, <font color="#2f4f4f">ran well over budget </font>and behind
schedule. Efforts to introduce modern computers and network equipment
were generally successful, but attempts to develop new research
software, which were outsourced to Science Applications International
Corporation (SAIC), were not. The Virtual Case File, or VCF as the
software was known, suffered from poorly defined objectives and
repeated management changes. <font color="#556b2f">In January </font>2005,
more than two years after the software was originally scheduled for
completion, the FBI formally abandoned the project. At least $100
million was spent on the project (by some estimates much more), but
it was never made operational. The FBI has been forced to continue
using its decades-old Automated Case Support system, which IT experts
deplore as woefully inadequate. In March 2005, the FBI announced the
launch of a new, more ambitious software project, code-named
Sentinel, which it expected to be ready by 2009.</p>

graduate student in <font color="#a9a9a9">computer science and

linked changes made by anonymous Wikipedia editors to the companies

compared Wikipedia edit logs with publicly available data on the

motivated by <font color="#dcdcdc">edits made </font><font color="#2f4f4f">by

Among other things, he found that FBI computers were being used <font color="#a0522d">to
edit an FBI article on Wikipedia.</font> Although the edits
correlated with known FBI IP addresses, there was no evidence that
the edits actually came from an FBI member or employee, only that
someone with access to the FBI network had edited the FBI Wikipedia
article. <font color="#228b22">Wikipedia </font>spokespeople <font color="#191970">welcomed

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1939, the FBI began compiling a
list of detainees who would be taken into custody <font color="#dcdcdc">in
the event of war with the </font>Axis powers. Most of the names on
the list belonged to <font color="#2f4f4f">leaders of the Issei

Naval Intelligence list that had focused on Japanese-Americans in
Hawaii and on the West Coast, but many German and Italian citizens
also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, Chief of
the Honolulu Bureau, was authorized by Hoover to begin arresting
those on the list on <font color="#556b2f">December 7, 1941, </font>while
the bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and
house searches (mostly without warrants) began within hours of the
attack, and over the next few weeks more than 5<font color="#6b8e23">,500
</font>Issei were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942,
President Franklin Roosevelt issued <font color="#a0522d">Executive

the West Coast. FBI Director <font color="#228b22">Hoover </font>opposed
the mass deportation and imprisonment of Japanese Americans
authorized by Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt won. Most complied
with subsequent deportation orders, but in a few cases where Japanese
Americans refused to obey the new military rules, FBI agents handled
their arrest. The FBI continued to monitor <font color="#191970">Japanese
Americans </font>throughout the war, conducting background checks on
those seeking relocation outside the camps, going into the camps
(usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority
officials) and obtaining informants to monitor dissidents and

protecting returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white

that established a 10-year term for future FBI directors, with a
maximum of two five-year terms, and required Senate confirmation of
appointed directors. Since Hoover was in office, this legislation did
not apply to him, but only to his successors. The current Director of
the FBI is <font color="#228b22">James B. Comey, who was </font>appointed

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Despite the fact that <font color="#a9a9a9">Martin
Luther fought </font>a fierce polemic against his Roman Catholic
opponents on the questions of Mary and the saints, theologians seem
to agree that Luther followed the Marian decisions and the dogmas of
the Church as given by the ecumenical councils. He held firmly to the
belief that Mary was an eternal virgin and Theotokos the <font color="#dcdcdc">Mother
of God. Of </font>particular note is the claim that Luther, some
<font color="#2f4f4f">three hundred years </font>before <font color="#556b2f">Pope
Pius IX </font>dogmatised the Immaculate Conception in <font color="#6b8e23">1854</font>,
was a firm believer in this view. Others argue that in later years
Luther changed his position on the concept of immaculacy, which was
then undefined in the Church, while maintaining Mary's sinlessness
throughout her life. For Luther, the Assumption of Mary was an early
understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible said nothing
about it and stopped celebrating it. What was important to him was
the belief that Mary and the saints lived after death. &quot;Throughout
his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught
and debated the veneration of Mary with a power of expression that
ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemic. His views are
closely related to his Christocentric theology and its implications
for liturgy and piety.&quot; Although Luther revered Mary, he came to
criticize the &quot;<font color="#a0522d">papists&quot; </font>for
blurring the line between high admiration for the grace of God,
wherever it appears in man, and religious service to another
creature. He regarded as idolatry the Roman Catholic practice of
celebrating saints' days and making intercessions, especially to Mary
and other deceased saints. His final thoughts on devotion to and
veneration of Mary are recorded in a sermon he preached <font color="#228b22">in
Wittenberg </font>just months before his death:</p>

immaculate conception of Mary, proclaimed ex cathedra by <font color="#a9a9a9">Pope
Pius IX </font>in <font color="#dcdcdc">1854, that </font>she was
full of grace from the moment she was conceived in her mother's <font color="#2f4f4f">womb

because their understanding of <font color="#6b8e23">original sin </font>(<font color="#a0522d">a

Protoevangelium of </font><font color="#dcdcdc">James, a </font>book
outside the canonical book, has been the source of many orthodox
beliefs about Mary. The account of Mary's life presented includes her
initiation as a virgin in the temple <font color="#2f4f4f">at the age

</font>blessed <font color="#6b8e23">Mary </font>and informed her

placed Mary on the <font color="#a0522d">third step of </font>the

grace. While in the temple, Mary was miraculously nourished by <font color="#228b22">an

At that time, the angel told Zechariah to betroth Mary to a widower
in Israel who would be revealed. This story is the subject of many of
the hymns of the Feast of the Presentation of Mary, and the icons of
the feast depict the story. Orthodox Christians believe that Mary
played a key role in the growth of Christianity during Jesus' life
and after his crucifixion, and Orthodox theologian Sergei Bulgakov
wrote: &quot;The Virgin Mary is the invisible but real centre of the
apostolic Church.&quot; She is also the Apostolic Church.</p>

official homecoming ceremony. She married Joseph and accompanied him

According to ancient Jewish custom, Mary could have been betrothed
around <font color="#dcdcdc">12</font>, but there is no direct
evidence of Mary's age at the time of her betrothal or pregnancy. The
term &quot;betrothal&quot; is a difficult translation of kiddushin;

</font>urban footprints in the world due to its low housing density,
which has led to extensive suburban sprawl, high car dependency and
low public transport outside inner city areas. Much of the city's
vegetation is of non-native species, most of which are of European
origin, and in many cases it is host to invasive species and noxious
weeds. Important introduced pests include the mynah, wild pigeon,
brown rat, European wasp, starling and red fox. Many suburban areas,
particularly in the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and
east, have experienced long periods without regenerating forest
fires, resulting in the absence of seedlings and undergrowth in the
original urban scrub. The Department of Sustainability and
Environment is partially addressing this problem by burning
regularly. Several national parks have been designated around the
Melbourne urban area, including Mornington Peninsula National Park,
Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National
Park in the south-east, Organ Pipes National Park in the north and
Dandenong Ranges National Park in the east. There are also a number
of significant state parks outside Melbourne. Responsibility for
pollution regulation lies with the <font color="#6b8e23">Victorian

capital cities in the sense that after the turn of the 20th century
it expanded and was driven by the idea of a '<font color="#a9a9a9">quarter
acre house and garden</font>' for every family, often referred to
locally as the Australian dream. This, and the popularity of the
private car after 1945, led to the car-centric urban structure that
prevails today in inner and outer suburbs. Much of Melbourne's
metropolitan area is therefore characterised by <font color="#2f4f4f">low-density,

journalist George Augustus Henry Sala coined the phrase &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Marvellous
Melbourne</font>&quot;, which survived well into the 20th century and
is still used by Melbournians today. The growing construction
activity culminated in the 'land boom', which reached its peak in
1888 at the height of speculative development, fuelled by consumer
confidence and rising land values. The boom resulted in a
proliferation of large commercial buildings, coffee palaces, terraced
housing and palatial mansions in the city. The establishment of the
Hydraulic Plant in 1887 enabled the local manufacture of <font color="#556b2f">lifts</font>,
which led to the construction of the first tall buildings, notably
the APA building, one of the tallest commercial buildings in the
world when completed in 1889. This period also saw the expansion of a
major radial rail-based transport network.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">John was born to Henry II of England
and Eleanor of Aquitaine on <font color="#a9a9a9">24 December 1166</font>.
Henry had inherited important territories on the Atlantic coast -
Anjou, Normandy and England - and had expanded his kingdom by
conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful <font color="#dcdcdc">Eleanor
of Aquitaine, who </font>ruled the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a
tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, in
addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result
was the kingdom of Angevin, named after Henry's patriotic title of
Count of Anjou, and especially after its seat of Angers.[nb 2] The
kingdom was, however, inherently fragile: although all the lands were
loyal to Henry, the various parts each had their own history,
traditions and administrative structure. Moving south through Anjou
and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces was
greatly reduced and bore little resemblance to the modern concept of
empire. Some of the traditional links between parts of the empire,
such as Normandy and England, were slowly disappearing over time. It
was unclear what would happen to the empire after Henry's death.
Although the system of kinship, whereby the eldest son inherited all
his father's lands, was slowly becoming common in Europe, it was less
popular among the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry
would divide the kingdom, giving each of his sons a significant
share, and hoped that his children would continue to work together as
allies after his death. Further complicating matters was the fact
that Henry held much of the Angevin kingdom only as vassal to the
rival line of the House of Capet, the King of France. Henry was often
allied with the <font color="#2f4f4f">Holy Roman Emperor </font>against
France, which made the feudal relationship even more challenging.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1173, John's older brothers,
supported by <font color="#a9a9a9">Eleanor, </font>rose up against
Henry in a short-lived rebellion between 1173 and 1174. Irritated by
the young King Henry II's subordinate position, and increasingly
concerned that more lands and castles might be given to John at his
expense, he travelled to <font color="#dcdcdc">Paris </font>and
allied himself with Louis VII. Eleanor, irritated by her husband's
continued involvement in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey
to join her brother Henry in Paris. Henry II defeated his sons'
alliance, but was generous to them in the peace treaty agreed at
Montlouis. The young King Henry was allowed to travel widely in
Europe with his knighthood, Richard regained Aquitaine and <font color="#2f4f4f">Geoffrey
</font>was allowed to return to Brittany; only <font color="#556b2f">Eleanor

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After Richard's death <font color="#a9a9a9">on
6 April 1199, </font>there were two possible claimants to the throne
of Angevin: <font color="#dcdcdc">John, </font>whose claim was based
on the fact that he was the only surviving son of Henry II, and young
Arthur I of Brittany, who had a claim as the son of John's elder
brother Geoffrey. Richard seems to have begun to recognise John as
his presumed heir in the last years before his death, but the matter
was not clear-cut, and there was little guidance in medieval law as
to how competing claims should be resolved. Norman law favoured John
as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favoured Arthur
as the only son of Henry's eldest son, so the issue quickly became an
open conflict. Most of the English and Norman nobility supported
John, and he was crowned <font color="#2f4f4f">at Westminster </font>with
the support of his mother Eleanor. The majority of the nobility of
Brittany, Maine and Anjou supported Arthur, and he was supported by
Philip II, who remained committed to the break-up of the Angevin
territories on the mainland. As Arthur's army pressed up the Loire
valley towards Angers and Philip's forces advanced down the valley
towards Tours, John's continental empire was in danger of being cut
in two.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although John was the Count of
Poitou and therefore the legitimate feudal lord of the Lusignans,
they could legitimately appeal to his actions in France to his own
feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did just that in 1201, and Philip summoned
John to the court of Paris in 1202 1201, invoking the treaty of Le
Goulet to establish his case. John did not want to undermine his
power in western France in this way. He argued that he did not need
to attend Philip's court because of his special status as Duke of
Normandy, who was exempted by feudal tradition from being summoned to
the French court. Philip claimed that he invited John not as Duke of
Normandy but as <font color="#dcdcdc">Count of Poitou, who </font>had
no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip
declared John in breach of his feudal obligations, transferred all
John's lands under the French crown to Arthur - except Normandy,
which he took back for himself - and launched a new war against John.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The governance of the Angevin
monarchs was vague and uncertain in nature. John's predecessors had
ruled according to <font color="#a9a9a9">the principle of vis et
voluntas</font>, or 'force <font color="#a9a9a9">and </font>will',
making executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified
on the grounds that the king was above the law. Both Henry II and
Richard had argued that kings had the quality of '<font color="#dcdcdc">divine
majesty'</font>; John continued this trend, claiming for himself as
ruler 'a quasi-imperial status'. There were conflicting views on the
nature of kingship <font color="#2f4f4f">in the 13th century</font>,
with many contemporary writers believing that monarchs should rule
according to custom and law and take advice from the leading members
of the realm. There was still no model of what should happen if a
king refused to do so. Despite his claim that he had unique power in
England, John sometimes justified his actions on the grounds that he
had consulted the barons. Modern historians remain divided as to
whether John's approach to governance was '<font color="#556b2f">royal
schizophrenia' </font>or whether his actions simply reflected the
complex pattern of Angevin kingship in the early 1300s.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At the beginning of John's reign,
<font color="#a9a9a9">prices changed suddenly </font>as poor harvests
and high demand for food pushed up the prices of grain and livestock
considerably. This inflationary pressure continued throughout the
<font color="#dcdcdc">1200s </font>and had long-lasting economic
consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were
exacerbated by deflationary shocks caused by John's military
campaigns. It was common at the time for the king to collect taxes in
silver, which was then reprinted into new coins; these coins were put
into barrels and sent to royal castles around the country to hire
mercenaries or cover other expenses. For example, when John was
preparing for military campaigns in Normandy, huge quantities of
silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months,
inadvertently making silver coins hard to come by, commercial credit
difficult to obtain and putting the economy under deflationary
pressure. The result was political unrest throughout the country. In
<font color="#2f4f4f">1204 and 1205, </font>John attempted to solve
some of the problems of the English currency <font color="#556b2f">by
thoroughly reforming the coins </font>and improving their quality and

between John and his second wife, <font color="#a9a9a9">Isabella of

relatively young - her exact date of birth is uncertain, and
estimates put her at no more than 15 at the time of the marriage, but
more likely at nine years old.[nb 15] Isabella married at a very
young age, even by the standards of the time. John did not contribute
much money to his wife's household, and he did not care about
Isabella's income from her land, to the extent that the historian
Nicholas Vincent has described him as &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">downright
mean</font>&quot; to Isabella. Vincent concluded that the marriage
was not particularly 'friendly'. Other aspects of their marriage
suggest a closer and more positive relationship. The chroniclers
record that John was 'madly in love' with Isabella, and John was
certainly married to Isabella between at least <font color="#2f4f4f">1207
and 1215</font>; they had <font color="#556b2f">five children.</font>
Unlike Vincent, historian William Chester Jordan concludes that the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When the war against France flared
up again in <font color="#a9a9a9">1202</font>, John won some initial
victories, but a lack of military resources and his treatment of the
Norwegians, Bretons and nobles of Anjou led to the collapse of his
kingdom in northern France in 1204. John spent much of the next
decade trying to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming
his armed forces and rebuilding his continental alliances. John's
legal reforms had a lasting impact on the English common law system,
and also provided a source of additional income. A dispute with Pope
Innocent III led to John's excommunication in1209 , and the king
finally settled the dispute in 1213. John's attempt to overthrow
Philip in 1214 failed, as John's allies were defeated by the French
at the Battle of Bouvines. On his return to England, John faced a
rebellion, with many barons unhappy with his fiscal policies and the
treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both
John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in <font color="#2f4f4f">1215</font>,
neither side abided by its terms. Soon afterwards, civil war broke
out, in which the Barons were aided by Louis of France. It soon
reached a stalemate. John died of dysentery, contracted while on a
campaign in East Anglia in late 1216; his son <font color="#556b2f">Henry

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the first years of John's
life, Henry tried to resolve the question of succession. The young
King Henry had been crowned King of England in <font color="#a9a9a9">1170</font>,
but his father had not given him any formal powers; he had also been
promised <font color="#dcdcdc">Normandy and Anjou </font>as part of
his future inheritance. Richard was to be appointed Count of Poitou,
who would rule Aquitaine, while <font color="#2f4f4f">Geoffrey was </font>to
become Duke of Brittany. At the time it seemed unlikely that John
would ever inherit any significant land, and his father playfully
nicknamed him '<font color="#556b2f">Lackland'.</font></p>

and was an avid hunter, even by medieval standards. He liked music,
though not singing. <font color="#2f4f4f">John </font>became a
'connoisseur of jewels', amassing a large collection, and became
famous for his luxurious clothes and, according to the French
chroniclers, bad wine. As John grew up, he was known for being
sometimes &quot;brilliant, witty, generous and hospitable&quot;; at

John got into <font color="#dcdcdc">a dispute with Pope Innocent III</font>,
which led to the king's excommunication. The Normans and Angevin
kings had traditionally had a great deal of power over the church in
their region. From 1040, however, successive popes had issued a
reform message stressing that the Church needed to be 'governed more
consistently and hierarchically from the centre' and that it needed
to be given 'its own authority and jurisdiction, separate and
independent of the jurisdiction and judgement of the lay ruler', in
the words of historian Richard Huscroft. After the 1140s, these
principles were largely accepted in the Church of England, although
they were accompanied by some concern about the centralisation of
Roman power. These changes challenged the customary rights of lay
lords like John to ecclesiastical appointments. Pope Innocent was<font color="#2f4f4f">,
according to historian Ralph Turner, an </font>'ambitious and
aggressive' religious leader who insisted on his rights and duties
within the Church.</p>

tried to persuade John to declare himself officially King of Ireland,
but Pope Lucius III refused. John's first reign in Ireland was not a
success. Anglo-Norman forces had only recently conquered Ireland, and
tensions remained between Henry II, the new settlers and the current
inhabitants. John infamously insulted the local Irish rulers <font color="#2f4f4f">by
mocking their unfashionable long beards</font>, failed to win allies
among the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose out militarily against

Richard's side, and the young King Henry died <font color="#dcdcdc">of

</font>would now become Duke of Aquitaine instead of Richard. Richard
refused to give up Aquitaine; Henry II was furious and ordered John,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Under increasing political pressure,
John finally negotiated terms of reconciliation, and the papal terms
of submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate
Pandulf Verraccio in <font color="#a9a9a9">May 1213 </font>at the
Temple Church of Dover. As part of the agreement, John offered to
surrender the Kingdom of England to the Pope in return for an annual
feudal tribute of 1<font color="#dcdcdc">,</font>000 marks (the
equivalent of £666 at the time): 700 marks (£466) to England and
300 marks (£200) to Ireland, as well as compensation for the
Church's lost income during the crisis. The treaty was formalised in
<font color="#2f4f4f">the Bulla Aurea</font>, or Golden Bull. The
resolution provoked mixed reactions. Although some chroniclers felt
that John had been humiliated by the course of events, public
reaction was limited. Innocentius benefited from the resolution of
his long-standing Anglican problem, but John probably benefited more,
as Innocentius became a staunch supporter of John throughout the
remainder of the reign, supporting John on both domestic and foreign
policy issues. Innocentus immediately turned against Philip, urging
him to abandon plans to invade England and ask for peace. John paid
part of the indemnity money he had promised the Church, but stopped
paying at the end of 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid;
Innocent seems to have forgotten this debt in favour of a
conveniently wider relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The political turmoil continued.
John began to explore an alliance with <font color="#a9a9a9">King
Philip II of France</font>, who had just returned from a crusade.
John hoped to gain control of Normandy, Anjou and other French lands
held by Richard in exchange for an alliance with Philip. His mother
persuaded John to renounce the alliance. Longchamp, who had left
England after Walter's intervention, now returned, claiming that he
had been wrongly dismissed from the office of Minister of Justice.
John intervened and suppressed Longchamp's claims in return for
promises of support from the royal administration, including
confirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard
still did not return from the Crusade, John began to <font color="#dcdcdc">claim
that his brother was dead </font>or otherwise permanently missing.
Richard had in fact been captured by <font color="#2f4f4f">the Duke
of Austria </font>on his way to England and was handed over to the
Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the
opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with
Philip. He agreed to give up his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and
married Philip's sister Alys in return for Philip's support. In
England, fighting broke out between the forces loyal to Richard and
those assembled by John. John's military position was weak and he
agreed to a truce; in early <font color="#556b2f">1194 the king
</font>finally returned to England and John's remaining forces
surrendered. John retreated to Normandy, where he was finally found
by Richard later that year. Richard declared that his younger
brother, despite his 27 years of age, was only 'a child with evil
counsellors' and forgave him, but took his lands from him except
Ireland.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The political situation in England
began to deteriorate rapidly. <font color="#a9a9a9">Longchamp </font>refused
to cooperate with Puiset, and he became an unpopular figure among the
English nobility and clergy. John took advantage of this unpopularity
to set himself up as an alternative monarch, with his own royal
court, his own magistrate, chancellor and other royal offices, and
was content to be described as an alternative regent and possibly the
next king. An armed conflict arose between John and Longchamp, and <font color="#dcdcdc">by
October 1191 </font>Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London
while John ruled the City of London, thanks to promises John had made
to the citizens in return for being recognised as Richard's
presumptive heir. At this point, Walter of Coutances, Archbishop of
Rouen, returned to <font color="#2f4f4f">England</font>, sent by
Richard to restore order. John's position was weakened by Walter's
relative popularity and the news that Richard had married while in
Cyprus, which allowed the possibility that Richard might have
legitimate children and heirs.</p>

<font color="#dcdcdc">Robert fitz Walter </font>as their military
leader. This self-appointed 'army of God' marched on London and
captured the capital as well as Lincoln and Exeter. John's efforts to
appear moderate and conciliatory had largely succeeded, but once the
rebels held London, they attracted a new wave of defectors from
John's royalist faction. John commissioned Langton to <font color="#2f4f4f">arrange

Isabella of Angoulême in <font color="#dcdcdc">August 1200.</font>
In order to remarry, John first had to give up his first wife,
Isabel, Countess of Gloucester. John managed to do this by claiming
that he had not obtained papal permission to marry Isabel - as a
cousin, John could not have legally married without this permission.
It is unclear why John decided to marry Isabella of Angoulême.
Contemporary chroniclers claimed that John was deeply in love with
Isabella, and John may have been motivated by a desire for an
apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the
Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital for
John: by marrying Isabella, John gained control of the important land
route between Poitou and <font color="#2f4f4f">Gascony</font>, which
significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine[nb 5].</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After his coronation, John moved his
army south to <font color="#a9a9a9">France </font>and took up a
defensive position on the eastern and southern borders of Normandy.
John's position was now stronger because <font color="#dcdcdc">Baldwin
IX of Flanders and Boulogne Renaud had </font>confirmed that the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Flemish </font>counts <font color="#dcdcdc">Baldwin
IX and Boulogne Renaud </font>had renewed the alliances against
France they had previously agreed with Richard. The possible nobleman
of Anjou, William des Roches, was persuaded to switch sides from
Arthur to John; suddenly the balance seemed to tip away from Philip
and Arthur in favour of John. Neither side wanted to continue the
conflict, and after a truce brokered by the Pope, the two leaders met
in January 1200 to negotiate possible peace terms. From John's point
of view, the events that followed offered an opportunity to
consolidate control of his continental possessions and to make a
lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip negotiated the
Treaty of Le Goulet in <font color="#2f4f4f">May 1200</font>; by the
treaty, Philip recognized John as the legitimate heir of Richard to
his French possessions and temporarily waived the broader claims of
his principal Arthur[nb 4] John, in turn, abandoned Richard's earlier
policy of restraining Philip through alliances with Flanders and
Boulogne, and accepted Philip's right to John as the legitimate
feudal ruler of the French lands. John's policy earned him the
disrespectful title of '<font color="#556b2f">John Softsword' </font>from
some English chroniclers<font color="#556b2f">, who </font>compared

marriage <font color="#dcdcdc">to </font>Henry II's granddaughter
<font color="#dcdcdc">Blanche of Castile</font>. Philip could give
him private support, but refused to openly support Louis, who had
been excommunicated by Innocent for his part in the war against John.
Louis' planned arrival in England posed a major problem for John, as
the prince would bring with him the naval vessels and siege equipment
necessary for the rebel cause. Having captured Alexander in Scotland,

As John's situation deteriorated, he seems to have decided to kill
Arthur in order to eliminate a potential rival and weaken the rebel
movement in Brittany. Arthur was initially imprisoned in <font color="#dcdcdc">Falaise</font>,
from where he was transferred to Rouen. Thereafter, Arthur's fate is
uncertain, but modern historians believe that he was murdered by
John. The annals of the monastery of Margam suggest that &quot;John
had captured Arthur and held him prisoner for some time in the castle
of Rouen ... when John was drunk, he killed Arthur with his own hands
and tied the body to a heavy stone and threw it into the Seine.&quot;
Rumours of Arthur's death further reduced John's support throughout
the region. Arthur's sister <font color="#2f4f4f">Eleanor</font>, who
had also been taken prisoner at Mirebeau, remained a prisoner of John
for many years, albeit in relatively good conditions.</p>

greatly strengthened by the victory of <font color="#a9a9a9">Mirebeau</font>,
but his treatment of his new prisoners and his ally William de Roches
quickly undermined these gains. De Roches was an influential Anjou
nobleman, but John largely ignored him, causing considerable injury,
while the king kept the rebel leaders in such bad conditions that
twenty-two of them died. At the time, most of the regional nobility
were closely linked to each other by kinship, and such behaviour
towards their relatives was considered reprehensible. <font color="#dcdcdc">William
de Roches </font>and other regional allies of John in Anjou and
Brittany abandoned him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose up in a
new rebellion. John's financial position was <font color="#2f4f4f">weak</font>:

to <font color="#a9a9a9">raise the large sums of money he needed </font>for
the planned Normandy recapture campaigns. The Angevin kings had three
main sources of income at their disposal, namely the revenue from
their personal lands, or demesne lands, the money they collected
through their feudal rights, and tax revenues. The income from the
royal patrimony was inelastic and had slowly declined since the
Norman conquest. The situation was not helped by the fact that
Richard sold many royal estates in <font color="#dcdcdc">1189</font>,
and taxation played a much smaller role in royal revenues than in
later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights that
could be used to raise revenue, including the scutage system, which
avoided feudal conscription by paying a cash payment to the king. The
king received income <font color="#2f4f4f">from fines, court fees and
the sale of charters and other privileges.</font> John made a
concerted effort to maximise all possible sources of income, to the
extent that he has been described as 'greedy, miserly, extortionate
and avaricious'. John also used revenue generation as a means of
exerting political power over the barons: debts to the crown of
supporters of the king could be forgiven, while the collection of
debts of enemies was more strictly enforced.</p>

procedures gave the royal courts a more important role in local
cases, which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local
lords. John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and
bailiffs and extended the system of coroners introduced by Hubert
Walter in1194 2001, creating a new category of coroners, the district
coroners. John worked very hard to ensure that the system worked
well, through the judges he appointed, by promoting legal experts and
expertise, and by intervening in the cases themselves. John continued
to deal with a relatively small number of cases, even during military
crises. In Lewis Warren's view, John 'discharged his royal duty of
dispensing justice ... with a zeal and indefatigability for which the
English common law is greatly indebted'. More critically, John may
have been motivated more by <font color="#2f4f4f">the opportunity
offered by the royal judicial process to collect fees </font>than by
a desire to dispense simple justice; John's system of justice also
applied only to freemen and not to the population as a whole.
However, the changes were favoured by many free tenants, as they
gained a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons,
against whom such cases were often brought. John's reforms were less
popular with the barons, especially as they were still subject to
arbitrary and often vindictive royal justice.</p>

</font>new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on
an examination of the evidence of his reign, such as the scrolls of
the tubes, inheritance records, court documents and similar primary
documents. In particular, an essay <font color="#dcdcdc">written by
Vivian Galbraith in 1945 </font>proposed a 'new approach' to
understanding the ruler. The use of recorded evidence was linked to a
growing scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of
John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. In many cases,
modern historians questioned the details provided by these
chroniclers who wrote after John's death. Interpretations of the
Magna Carta and the role of the rebellious barons in 1215 have been
significantly revised: while the symbolic, constitutional value of
the charter for later generations is undisputed, most historians now
regard it, in the context of John's reign, as a failed peace treaty
between 'partisan' factions. The nature of John's Irish policy has
been increasingly debated. Experts in medieval Irish history, such as
Sean Duffy, have challenged the traditional account by <font color="#2f4f4f">Lewis
Warren </font>and argued that Ireland was not as stable by 1216 as

paragon of total loyalty. The most notorious case, which went beyond
anything considered acceptable at the time, was William de Braose, an

demands for punishment, and when he refused to pay the huge sum of
40<font color="#2f4f4f">,000 </font>marks (the equivalent of £26,666

difficulty in obtaining grants, honours or petitions; Henry II had

Thomas Becket, which </font>eventually led to Becket's death. John

measure, John recreated a version of Henry II's Assize of Arms of1181
, in which each shire created a structure for mobilising local
levies. When the threat of invasion subsided, John formed a large
military force in England, destined for Poitou, and a large fleet of
soldiers under his own command, destined for Normandy. To achieve
this, John reformed the participation of English feudal lords in his
military campaigns and created a more flexible system in which only
<font color="#2f4f4f">one </font>knight out of ten was actually on
manoeuvres, but nine others supported him financially; the knights
served indefinitely. John set up a strong engineering team for siege
warfare and a considerable number of professional crossbowmen. The
king was supported by a number of leading barons with military
expertise, such as William Longespée, William the Marshal, Roger de
Lacy and, until he lost favour, William de Braose, the Marshal.</p>

concentrated on trying to recapture <font color="#a9a9a9">Normandy</font>.
The available evidence suggests that John did not see the loss of the
duchy as a permanent transfer of <font color="#dcdcdc">power to the
</font>Capetians. Strategically, John faced several challenges:
securing England itself against possible French invasion, securing
the sea routes to Bordeaux after the loss of the land route to
Aquitaine, and securing his remaining holdings in Aquitaine after the
death of his mother Eleanor in April 1204. John's primary plan was to
<font color="#2f4f4f">use Poitou as a base</font>, advance up the
Loire Valley to threaten Paris, stop the French forces and cut off
internal communications with Philip before he could land naval forces
in the duchy itself. Ideally, this plan would benefit from the
opening of a second front on the eastern borders of the Philippines
with Flanders and Boulogne - effectively a re-creation of Richard's
old strategy of pressure from Germany. All this would require a lot
of money and soldiers.</p>

of Ireland </font>throughout his reign. He needed resources from the
country for his war with Philip on the mainland. Conflict continued
in Ireland between Anglo-Norman settlers and the chiefs of the native
Irish, and John manipulated both groups to expand his wealth and
power in the country. Under Richard, John had succeeded in <font color="#dcdcdc">increasing
his land holdings in Ireland, </font>and he continued this policy as
king. In <font color="#2f4f4f">1210, the king </font>arrived in
Ireland with a large army to crush the rebellion of the Anglo-Norman
lords; he reasserted control over his country and, through a new
charter, ordered that Ireland should abide by English laws and
customs. John did not actively seek to enforce this charter in the
original kingdoms of Ireland, but historian David Carpenter suspects
that he might have done so had it not been for the intervention of
the English freehold conflict. Tensions with the Irish native leaders
continued to exist even after John left for England.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The border and political
relationship between England and Scotland was disputed in <font color="#a9a9a9">the
late 13th and </font>early <font color="#a9a9a9">13th centuries</font>,
with the Scottish kings claiming parts of what is now northern
England. John's father <font color="#dcdcdc">Henry II </font>had
forced William the Lion to swear allegiance to him in the Treaty of
Falaise in 1174. Richard I revoked this treaty in 1189 in return for
financial compensation, but the relationship remained uneasy. John
began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed
northern counties. He rejected William's request for the county of
Northumbria, but did not intervene in Scotland itself, concentrating
instead on his problems in continental Europe. The kings maintained
friendly relations and met in 1206 and 1207, until 1209, when it was
rumoured that William intended to form an alliance with Philip II of
France. John invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the <font color="#2f4f4f">Treaty
of Norham</font>, which gave John control of William's daughters and
required a payment of £10,000. This effectively crippled William's
power north of the border, and by 1212, John had to intervene
militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal
rivals.[nb 16] However, John did not seek to revive the Treaty of
Falaise, and both William and Alexander remained independent kings,
supported by John but not loyal to him.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">John treated the ban <font color="#a9a9a9">as
</font>&quot;the <font color="#a9a9a9">equivalent of a papal
declaration of war</font>&quot;. He responded by trying to punish
Innocent personally and by driving a wedge between those members of
the English clergy who might have supported him and those who were
firmly allied with the Roman authorities. John confiscated the lands
of <font color="#dcdcdc">clergy members who refused to worship and
the </font>estates of those who associated themselves with Innocent;
he arrested the illegal concubines that many priests were keeping at
the time and released them only after paying fines; he confiscated
the lands of church members who fled England and promised protection
to those clergy members who wished to remain loyal to him. In many
cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms that
allowed them to manage their own property and keep the proceeds of
their holdings. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution,
and Innocentius threatened to excommunicate John if he did not accept
Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocentus cursed the
king <font color="#2f4f4f">in November 1209.</font> Although this was
in theory a major blow to John's legitimacy, it did not seem to worry
the king much. Two of John's close allies, the Emperor Otto IV and
Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same
punishment themselves, and the curse had diminished somewhat in
importance. John simply tightened up his existing measures and
collected substantial sums from the revenues of the vacant cathedrals
and monasteries: one estimate of 1213, for example, is that the
Church had lost an estimated 100,<font color="#556b2f">000 </font>marks
(equivalent to £66,666 at the time) to John. According to official

John Foxe, William Tyndale and Robert Barnes regarded John as an
early Protestant hero, and John Foxe included the king in his
martyrdom account. <font color="#2f4f4f">John Speed's Historie of
Great Britaine (</font>1632<font color="#2f4f4f">) </font>praised
John's 'great reputation' as king, blaming the partiality of medieval

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Nineteenth-century fictional
depictions of John were greatly influenced by Sir Walter Scott's
historical novel <font color="#a9a9a9">Ivanhoe, </font>which gave an
&quot;almost entirely unflattering portrait&quot; of the king,
drawing on Victorian historiography of the period and Shakespeare's
play. Scott's work influenced the late 19th century children's author
Howard Pyle's The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which in turn
established John as <font color="#dcdcdc">the</font> main character
in the traditional Robin Hood story. Sam De Grasse, as John in the
black and white film version of 1922, commits numerous atrocities and
tortures. <font color="#2f4f4f">Claude Rains </font>played John in
the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn, which started a trend
of portraying John in films as a 'effeminate ... arrogant and
cowardly housewife'. The character of John either emphasises the
virtues of King Richard or is the antithesis of the Sheriff of
Nottingham, who is usually contrasted with Robin as the 'flamboyant
villain'. An extreme version of this trend can be seen, for example,
in the Disney cartoon version, where John, played by Peter Ustinov,
is a 'cowardly, thumb-sucking lion'. In popular works that depict
John outside the Robin Hood legends, such as James Goldman's play and
later film The Lion in Winter, set in 1183, he is usually portrayed
as a 'weakling', in this case in contrast to the more virile Henry
II, or as a tyrant, such as A. A. Milne's poem for children, 'King
John's Christmas'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The historical interpretations of
John have changed considerably over the years. Medieval chroniclers
provided the first modern or near-modern accounts of John's reign.
One group of chroniclers wrote early in John's life or around the
time of his accession, including <font color="#a9a9a9">Richard of
Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto.
</font>These historians were generally <font color="#dcdcdc">negative
about </font>John's behaviour during Richard's reign, but were
slightly more positive about the early years of John's reign. There
are fewer reliable accounts of the middle and late part of John's
reign, the most important being by Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of
Coggeshall, neither of whom were positive about John's conduct as
king. Much of John's later negative reputation was created by two
chroniclers who wrote after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and
Matthew Paris, the latter of whom claimed that John attempted to
convert to <font color="#2f4f4f">Islam </font>in return for military
aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad al-Nasir - a story that modern
historians find untrue.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Popular depictions of John began to
emerge <font color="#a9a9a9">during the Tudor period</font>,
reflecting the revisionist historiography of the time. In the
anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John, the king was
portrayed as a '<font color="#dcdcdc">proto-protestant martyr', as in
</font>John Bale's morality play Kynge Johan, in which John tries to
save England from 'the evil agents of the Church of Rome'. In
contrast, Shakespeare's King John, a relatively anti-Catholic play
based on The Troublesome Reign, offers 'a more balanced, ambivalent
view of the complex monarch as both a proto-protestant victim of
Roman intrigue and a weak, selfishly motivated ruler'. Anthony
Munday's play <font color="#2f4f4f">The Downfall and The Death of
Robert Earl of Huntington </font>portrays many of John's negative
traits, but adopts a positive interpretation of the King's stance
against the Roman Catholic Church, in line with contemporary views of
Tudor monarchs. By the mid-1700s, plays such as Robert Davenport's
King John and Matilda, although largely based on earlier Elizabethan
works, shifted the role of the Protestant defender to the barons and
focused more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour.</p>

his reign, revising it from time to time since the 1500s. The
historian <font color="#dcdcdc">Jim Bradbury </font>has summarised
the opinion of contemporary historians on John's positive qualities
by stating that John is now generally regarded as 'a hard-working
administrator, a capable man and an able general'. However, modern
historians agree that he also had many faults as a king, including,
according to historian Ralph Turner, &quot;repulsive, even dangerous
traits&quot; such as pettiness, malice and cruelty. These negative
traits provided fiction writers of the Victorian era with plenty of
material, and John remains a recurring figure in <font color="#2f4f4f">Western

of <font color="#2f4f4f">Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau </font>into
John's name; as John was only five years old, his father would

enthusiastic about this; although he had not yet taken control of any
castles in his new kingdom, these castles were effectively his future

reign, John supported his brother on the continent with apparent
loyalty. Richard's policy on the continent was to try to regain,
through steady and limited military campaigns, the castles he had
lost to Philip II during the Crusades. He allied himself with the
leaders of Flanders, Boulogne and the Holy Roman Empire to put
pressure on Philip from Germany. <font color="#a9a9a9">In 1195, </font>John
<font color="#a9a9a9">successfully </font>led a sudden attack and
siege of the castle of Évreux and then led the defence of Normandy
against Philip. The following year, John captured the town of Gamache
and led a raid 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Paris, capturing the
bishop of Beauvais. In return for this favour, Richard withdrew his
malice towards <font color="#2f4f4f">John</font>, restored him to the

strategically from Isabella's marriage, the marriage also threatened
the interests of the Lusignans, whose own lands currently provided a
key route for royal goods and troops through Aquitaine. Instead of
negotiating some form of compensation, John treated Hugh with
'<font color="#2f4f4f">contempt</font>', leading to a Lusignan
rebellion which John quickly crushed and who also intervened to
suppress Raoul in Normandy.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In late 1203, John attempted to
liberate <font color="#a9a9a9">Château Gaillard</font>, which was
besieged by Philip and guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John
attempted a synchronised operation involving land and naval forces.
Most historians today regard it as imaginative, but too complex for
the forces of the time to have carried out successfully. <font color="#dcdcdc">Philip's
troops </font>thwarted John's relief effort, and John turned back to
Brittany to try to lure Philip away from eastern Normandy. John
succeeded in destroying much of Brittany, but failed to divert
Philip's main attack into eastern Normandy. Historians' opinions of
John's military skill during this campaign vary, with the most recent
historians suggesting that his performance was satisfactory, though
not impressive.[nb 8] John's position began to deteriorate rapidly.
Philip and his predecessors had cultivated the eastern frontier of
Normandy extensively for several years, while Angevin's power in the
south had weakened after Richard had surrendered several key castles
some years earlier. His use of routine mercenaries in the central
regions had quickly eroded his remaining support in this area as
well, setting the stage for the sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb
9] John withdrew back across the Channel in December and sent orders
for a new defensive line to be established west of the Chateau
Gaillard. <font color="#2f4f4f">In March 1204, </font>Gaillard fell<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font>
John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not only a
personal blow to John, but threatened to unravel Angevin's widespread
alliances in southern France. Philip moved south around a new
defensive line and struck upwards into the heart of the duchy, where
resistance was now limited. By August, Philip had conquered Normandy
and advanced south to conquer Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only
remaining domain on the mainland was now <font color="#556b2f">the
Duchy of Aquitaine.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The result was a series of
innovative but unpopular economic measures.[nb 10] During his
seventeen years as king, John levied fines <font color="#a9a9a9">eleven
</font>times, compared to a total of eleven during the three previous
monarchs. In many cases, these levies were collected without actual
military service, which was contrary to the original idea that fines
were an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his
right to claim grants when estates and castles were levied, sometimes
collecting huge sums that exceeded the ability of the barons to pay.
John initiated a new round of appointments, based on the successful
sale of sheriff appointments in1194 , and the new officials recovered
their investment by increasing fines and penalties, especially in the
forests. Under John, another of Richard's innovations, the levies on
widows who wished to remain unmarried, was extended. John continued
to sell charters for new towns, such as the planned city of
Liverpool, and charters were sold in markets across the kingdom and
in Gascony.[nb 11] The king introduced new taxes and extended
existing ones. The <font color="#2f4f4f">Jews, who </font>were
vulnerable in medieval England and protected only by the king, were
subjected to huge taxes; the 1210 Tallage tax collected £44,000 from
the community, much of which was passed on to Christian debtors of
Jewish moneylenders[nb 12].[nb 12] John created a new tax on income
and movable property1207 , effectively a version of the modern earned
income tax, which raised £60,000; he created new import and export
duties, which were paid directly to the Crown. John found that these
measures enabled him to raise more funds by confiscating the lands of
barons who were unable or refused to pay.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">John's personal life had a great
impact on his reign. According to contemporary chronicles, John was
sinfully lustful and pious. It was common for kings and nobles of the
time to have mistresses, but the chroniclers complained that John's
mistresses were <font color="#a9a9a9">married noblewomen, which </font>was
not considered acceptable. John had at least <font color="#dcdcdc">five
</font>children with mistresses in his first marriage to Isabelle of
Gloucester, and two of these mistresses are known to have been
noblewomen. However, John's behaviour after his second marriage to
Isabella of Angoulême is less clear. <font color="#2f4f4f">None of
</font>John's known illegitimate children were born after his
remarriage, and there is no actual documentary evidence of adultery
afterwards, although John certainly had female friends at court
throughout. The specific accusations made against John during the
Baronial Revolt are now generally regarded as trumped up to justify
the rebellion; however, most of John's contemporaries seem to have
regarded John's sexual behaviour as bad[nb 14].</p>

unevenly, with the land divided between the Marcher lords living on

interest in <font color="#a9a9a9">Wales </font>and knew the country
well, visiting annually between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his
illegitimate daughter Joan to the Welsh prince <font color="#dcdcdc">Llywelyn
the Great</font>. The king used the <font color="#2f4f4f">marquises
and native Welsh </font>to increase his territory and power by
entering into increasingly detailed treaties with the Welsh rulers,
backed by the king's military might. A major royal expedition to
enforce these treaties took place in <font color="#556b2f">1211</font>,
when Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the
deposition of William de Braose through the Welsh rebellion of 1211.
John's invasion, which struck at the heartlands of Wales, was a
military success. Llywelyn reached an agreement that included the
extension of John's power to most of Wales, albeit only temporarily.</p>

Rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been
constantly circumvented, at least informally. Although the ban was a
burden on a large part of the population, it did not lead to a revolt
against John. By 1213, however, John was increasingly concerned about
the threat of <font color="#2f4f4f">French invasion.</font> Some
contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of

barons but also to control the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen
Langton. Meanwhile, John began to recruit new mercenaries <font color="#dcdcdc">in

Victorian </font>period of the 19th century, historians were more
inclined to rely on the estimates of the chroniclers and focus on
John's moral personality. Kate Norgate, for example, argued that
John's downfall was not due to his failure in war or strategy but to
his 'almost superhuman wickedness', while <font color="#dcdcdc">James
Ramsay </font>blamed John's family background and his cruel
personality for his downfall. Historians in the Whiggish tradition,
focusing on documents such as the <font color="#2f4f4f">Domesday Book
and Magna Carta</font>, trace the progressive and universalist
direction of English political and economic development in the Middle
Ages. These historians were often inclined to regard John's reign,
and in particular the Magna Carta he signed, as a positive step in
the constitutional development of England, despite the king's
shortcomings. Winston Churchill, for example, argued that 'when the
long tally is taken, it will be seen that the British people and the
English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the
efforts of virtuous rulers'.</p>

from Eleanor to a nanny, a traditional practice in medieval noble
families. Eleanor then left for <font color="#a9a9a9">Poitiers, the
</font>capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan north
to the convent of Fontevrault. This may have been to guide her
youngest son, who had no clear heritage, towards a future
ecclesiastical career. Eleanor spent the next few years scheming with
her husband Henry, and neither parent was involved in John's early
life. John was probably, like his brothers, given <font color="#dcdcdc">a
tutor </font>during his time at Fontevrault, a teacher whose job was
to look after his early education and the servants in his immediate
household; later John was taught by <font color="#2f4f4f">Ranulph

the expense of various nobles. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1175 </font>he
took over the estates of the late Earl of Cornwall and gave them to
John. The following year, Henry, contrary to legal custom, disposed

became king <font color="#a9a9a9">in September 1189</font>, he had
already announced his intention to join the Third Crusade<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font>
Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required by the
expedition by selling off lands, titles and appointments, trying to
ensure that he would not face a rebellion while away from his
kingdom. John was made Earl of Mortain, married to the wealthy Isabel
of Gloucester and given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties
of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all in
order to buy John's loyalty to Richard while he was on his crusade.
Richard retained royal control of the principal castles in these
counties, thus preventing John from amassing too much military and
political power, and the king appointed Arthur of Brittany, now four
years old, heir to the throne. In return, John promised not to visit
England for the next three years, which in theory gave Richard enough
time to carry out a successful crusade and return from the Levant
without fear of John seizing power. Richard left political power in
England - the office of Attorney General - in the hands of Bishop
Hugh de Puiset and William Mandeville, and made William Longchamp,
Bishop of Ely, his chancellor. Mandeville died immediately, and
<font color="#dcdcdc">Longchamp </font>became joint justiciar with
Puiset in what proved to be a less satisfactory partnership. Queen

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Normandy's warfare at the time was
shaped by the <font color="#a9a9a9">defences of its castles </font>and
the rising costs of military campaigns. The Norman frontiers had few
natural defences, but were heavily fortified with castles such as
<font color="#dcdcdc">Château Gaillard </font>in strategic
locations, built and maintained at considerable cost. It was
difficult for the commander to advance far into new territories
without securing access routes by capturing these fortifications,
which slowed the advance of the invasion. The armies of the period
could be made up of either feudal or mercenary forces. Mercenaries,
often called <font color="#2f4f4f">Brabançons </font>after the Duchy
of <font color="#2f4f4f">Brabant </font>but in fact recruited from
all over northern Europe, could operate all year round and offer the
commander more strategic options for conducting the campaign, but
they cost much more than the equivalent feudal forces. As a result,
commanders increasingly used mercenaries during this period.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">John initially adopted a defensive
posture similar to that of 1199: he avoided open battle and carefully
defended his main castles. John's operations became more belligerent
as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress
eastwards. In July, John learned that Arthur's forces were
threatening his mother Eleanor at the castle of Mirebeau. Accompanied
by his seneschal <font color="#a9a9a9">William de Roches of </font>Anjou,
he quickly sent his mercenary army south to protect her mother. His
troops surprised <font color="#dcdcdc">Arthur </font>and captured the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">John inherited <font color="#a9a9a9">a

agents were responsible for the royal finances: the Chancery kept
books and kept records of communications, <font color="#dcdcdc">the

Treasury with </font>expenditure, and various magistrates were used
to administer justice throughout the realm. Thanks to the efforts of
men like Hubert Walter, this trend towards better accounting
continued during his reign. Like previous kings, John led an
itinerant court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both
local and national matters. John was very active in the
administration of England, and was involved in all aspects of
government. To some extent he followed in the tradition of <font color="#2f4f4f">Henry
I and Henry II</font>, but by the 1200s the amount of administrative
work had increased considerably, putting considerable pressure on a
king who wanted to rule in this style. John stayed in England for
much longer periods than his predecessors, which made his rule more
personal than that of previous kings, especially in previously
neglected areas such as the north.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">John's royal family was based on
<font color="#a9a9a9">several succession groups</font>. One group was
the familiares regis, John's closest friends and knights who
travelled with him around the country. They also played an important
role in organising and leading military campaigns. Another group of
the king's followers were the curia regis; these curiales were the
<font color="#dcdcdc">king's highest officials and agents, and were
</font>essential in his day-to-day administration. Membership of
these inner circles brought enormous advantages, as it was easier to
gain favour with the king, bring lawsuits, marry a rich heiress or
have debts forgiven. Under Henry II, 'new men' were increasingly
elected to these posts who were not part of the normal ranks of the
barons. This increased during John's reign, and many lower nobles
arrived from the mainland for court posts; many of them were
mercenary leaders from Poitou. These men included soldiers who became
notorious in England <font color="#2f4f4f">for their uncivilised
behaviour, </font>such as Falkes de Breauté, Geard d'Athies,
Engelard de Cigongé and Philip Marc. Many barons regarded the king's
household as, in Ralph Turner's characterisation, 'a narrow clique
which enjoyed the king's favour at the expense of the barons' and
whose staff consisted of disadvantaged men.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Contemporary chroniclers and later
historians have noted John's lack of religious conviction, and some
suspect that John was at best <font color="#a9a9a9">godless </font>or
even atheistic, a very serious matter at the time. Contemporary
chroniclers long listed his various anti-religious habits, such as
his failure to take communion, his blasphemous remarks, and his witty
but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including jokes about the
unbelievability of the resurrection. They comment on John's meagre
charitable donations to the church. Historian Frank McLynn argues
that John's early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively
high education, may have turned him against the Church. Other
historians have been more cautious in their interpretation of this
material, stating that the chroniclers also reported John's personal
interest in the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendship
with several high-ranking priests, notably <font color="#dcdcdc">Hugh
of Lincoln</font>, who was later canonised. The financial records
show that the ordinary royal family attended the usual feasts and
pious festivities - although many records of <font color="#2f4f4f">John's
donations to the poor </font>show that he routinely atoned for
breaking church rules and regulations. Historian Lewis Warren has
argued that the chroniclers' accounts were remarkably biased and that
the king was 'at least conventionally pious', citing his pilgrimages
and his interest in religious writings and commentaries.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the interregnum of 1206-1208,
John <font color="#a9a9a9">focused on building up his financial and
military resources </font>in preparation for a new attempt to retake
Normandy. John used some of this money to finance new alliances on
the eastern borders of the Philippines, where the growth of Capetian
power was beginning to worry France's neighbours. By 1212, John had
successfully forged alliances with his nephew <font color="#dcdcdc">Otto
IV</font>, who was seeking the throne of Holy German Emperor in
Germany, and with the Counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of
Flanders. Plans for an invasion in 1212 were postponed because the
English barons were again restless about the services to be rendered
at Poitou. Philip took the initiative in 1213 and sent his elder son
Louis to conquer Flanders with the intention of attacking England
next. John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to meet this
threat. He sent his new fleet to attack the French <font color="#2f4f4f">in
the port of Damme</font>. The attack was a success, destroying
Philip's ships and any chance of invading England that year. John had
hoped to exploit this advantage by attacking himself in late 1213,
but the discontent of the barons delayed his plans to attack again
until early 1214, which proved to be his last campaign in continental
Europe.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Tensions between John and the barons
had been growing for several years, as the conspiracy against the
king in 1212 showed. Many of the disaffected barons were from <font color="#a9a9a9">the
north of England</font>, a group often referred to by contemporaries
and historians as 'northerners'. The northern barons rarely had any
personal stake in the French conflict, and many of them owed John
large sums of money; the rebellion has been described as a 'revolt of
the king's debtors'. Many members of John's military household joined
the rebels, especially those whom John had appointed to
administrative posts in various parts of England; their local
connections and loyalties were more important than their personal
loyalty to John. Tensions were also growing in North Wales, where
opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning
into open conflict. For some, the appointment of <font color="#dcdcdc">Peter
des Roches </font>as Minister of Justice was a major factor, as many
barons regarded him as a 'vexatious foreigner'. <font color="#2f4f4f">The
failure of John's French campaign in </font>1214 was probably the

Runnymede, near Windsor Castle, <font color="#a9a9a9">on 15 June
1215</font>. Langton's efforts to mediate resulted in the creation of
a charter in which the proposed peace treaty was written, later known
as the <font color="#dcdcdc">Magna Carta </font>or 'Great Charter'.
The Charter addressed more than just certain baronial grievances and
constituted a broader political reform proposal, albeit one that
focused on the rights of free men rather than serfs and free labour.
It promised protection of ecclesiastical rights, protection from
unlawful imprisonment, speedy access to justice, new taxation only
with the consent of the barons, and restrictions on scutal and other
feudal dues. A council of <font color="#2f4f4f">twenty-five </font>barons

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Most modern historians, including
recent biographers of John, <font color="#a9a9a9">Ralph Turner and
Lewis Warren</font>, argue that John was a failed ruler, but point
out that the chroniclers of the 1200s and 1300s exaggerated his
failures. Jim Bradbury notes that the consensus today is that John
was 'a hard-working administrator, an able man, a capable general',
although, as Turner suggests, he had 'repugnant, even dangerous
traits', such as pettiness, malice and cruelty. John Gillingham, who
has written an important biography of Richard I, also follows this
line, although he regards John as <font color="#dcdcdc">a less
effective general </font>than Turner or Warren and describes him as
'one of the worst kings ever to rule England'. Bradbury takes a
moderate line, but believes that modern historians have been too
lenient in recent years in their treatment of <font color="#2f4f4f">John's
many errors</font>. The popular historian Frank McLynn takes the
opposite view of John, arguing that the king's modern reputation
among historians is 'bizarre' and that as a monarch John 'fails to
pass almost all the [tests] that can legitimately be set'.</p>

<font color="#a9a9a9">expensive, </font>which hampered its
competitiveness in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for
consumers and IBM Personal Computer and its clone market for
businesses. Macintosh systems still thrived <font color="#dcdcdc">in
education and desktop publishing </font>and kept Apple as the second
largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the 1990s,
improvements to the competing Wintel platform, notably the
introduction of Windows 3.0 and later Windows 95, gradually took
market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. Intel's
Pentium system broke the performance advantage of the 68000-based
Macintosh systems, and in 1994 Apple dropped to third place as Compaq
became the largest PC manufacturer. Even after the 1994 switch to the
superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh (later renamed PowerMac after
the PowerBook series), the Macintosh user base declined with the fall
in PC component prices and the release of Windows 95.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Smith's first Macintosh was built to
Raskin's design specifications: it had <font color="#a9a9a9">64
kilobytes </font><font color="#dcdcdc">(kB) of </font>RAM, used a
Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and could support a 256×256 pixel
black-and-white bitmap display. <font color="#2f4f4f">Bud Tribble</font><font color="#556b2f">,
a member of the Mac team, </font>was interested in using Apple Lisa
graphics software on the Macintosh and asked Smith if he could
incorporate the <font color="#6b8e23">Lisa Motorola 68000
microprocessor </font>into the Mac while keeping production costs
low. By December 1980, Smith had managed to design a circuit board
that not only used the 68000, but also increased its speed from 5 MHz
to 8 MHz; this board was also capable of supporting a 384×256 pixel
display. Smith's design used <font color="#a0522d">fewer RAM chips
than Lisa's, making the </font>board much more cost-effective to
manufacture. The final Mac model was self-contained, with a full
QuickDraw visual language and interpreter in 64 kB of ROM - far more
than most other computers. It had 128 kB of RAM in the form of
sixteen 64 kilobit (kb) RAM chips soldered to a logic board. Although
there were no <font color="#228b22">memory slots</font>, the RAM
could be expanded to 512 kB by soldering sixteen IC sockets into
which 256 kb RAM chips could be installed in place of the
factory-installed chips. The final product had a 9-inch 512x342 pixel
monochrome display, which exceeded the size of the planned screen.</p>

which offered several Mac clone series, including the PowerWave,
PowerTower and PowerTower Pro. These companies had invested
considerable resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware.
Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to
continue selling Mac clones until its license expired because it had
a significant position in the lower price segment that Apple did not
have. In September 1997, Apple extended Umax's licence, allowing it
to be the only clone manufacturer to sell clones running Mac OS 8,
but with the restriction that Umax had to sell only low-cost systems.
However, without the higher profit margins on high-end systems, Umax
found that this would not be profitable and exited the Mac clone

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The current Mac family uses <font color="#a9a9a9">Intel
</font>x86-64 processors. Apple introduced an emulator when it
switched from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), just as it did when it
switched from Motorola's 68000 architecture ten years earlier. The
<font color="#dcdcdc">Macintosh </font>is the only mainstream
computer platform to have successfully migrated to the new processor
architecture, and it has done so twice. All current Mac models come
standard with at least <font color="#2f4f4f">8GB of </font>RAM,
except for the 1.4GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina display)
and MacBook Air. Today's Macs use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce
graphics cards and Intel's graphics chip integrated into the main
processor. Not all current Macs (except the MacBook Pro, which does
not have a Retina display) have an optical media drive that includes
a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple calls this the SuperDrive.
Current Macs have <font color="#556b2f">two </font>standard data
ports: USB and <font color="#6b8e23">Thunderbolt </font>(except the
MacBook (2015 version), which has only a USB-C port and a headphone
jack). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air and Mac Mini now also have a
&quot;<font color="#a0522d">Thunderbolt</font>&quot; port, which
Apple says can transfer data at <font color="#228b22">speeds of up to
10 gigabits per second.</font> USB was introduced on the iMac G3 in
1998 and is now ubiquitous, while FireWire is reserved mainly for
high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras.
Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in <font color="#191970">October
2005, </font>Apple began including built-in iSight cameras in
appropriate models and a media hub interface called<font color="#8b0000">
Front Row</font>, which can be used with the Apple Remote or keyboard
to access media stored on the computer. However, Front Row has been
discontinued since 2011 and the Apple Remote is no longer shipped

Raskin</font>, who envisioned <font color="#2f4f4f">an easy-to-use

name the computer after his favourite apple, McIntosh, but the

the <font color="#6b8e23">sound system </font>manufacturer McIntosh
Laboratory, Inc. Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give
Apple permission to use the name with the changed spelling so that
Apple could use it, but the request was denied, which eventually
forced Apple to buy the rights to use the name (an article in Byte
Magazine in 1984 suggested that Apple changed the spelling only after
&quot;early users&quot; misspelled &quot;McIntosh&quot;. However, Jef
Raskin had already adopted the Macintosh spelling in 1981, when the
Macintosh computer was still a prototype machine in the laboratory.
This explanation still contradicts the first explanation above, which

January 1985. In 1985, Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz for the
Macintosh platform following the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM

with the majority being <font color="#dcdcdc">MacBooks</font>, which
focus on the ultraportable niche, the most profitable and only
growing segment of PCs. It also helped that the Macintosh line is
simple, updated annually, and consistent both in Apple's retail
stores and at authorized dealers, which have a special &quot;store in
store&quot; department to distinguish them from Windows PCs. In
contrast, Windows PC manufacturers tend to have a wide range of
products, selling only a subset of products at retail and the full
range online, and often also limited-time or region-specific models.

home screen, and Resume, which is similar to the hibernation feature

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By March 2011, OS X's market share
in North America had risen to <font color="#a9a9a9">just over 14%</font>.
Whether the Mac's market share and installed base matters, and to
whom, is a hotly debated question. Industry experts have often
pointed to the relatively small market share of the Mac to predict
Apple's impending demise, particularly in the early and mid-1990s
when the company's future looked bleakest. Others argue that market
share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has
positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, so it can be
misleading to compare it <font color="#dcdcdc">to a low-cost PC</font>.
Given the rapid growth of the overall personal computer market, the
Mac's growing sales figures are effectively overshadowed by the
growing sales of the industry as a whole. Apple's small market share
therefore gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than
ten years ago, when the opposite is true. Growing sales of the iPhone
and iPad mean that the Macintosh's share of Apple's profits has
fallen to 24% in 2010 from 46% two years ago. Others try to downplay
the importance of market share, citing the fact that it is rarely
taken up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share,
Apple has remained profitable since <font color="#2f4f4f">Steve Jobs'
</font><font color="#556b2f">return </font>and the subsequent
reorganisation of the company. According to a report published in the
first quarter of 2008, Apple had a 14% market share of the US
personal computer market, accounting for 66% of all computers over
$1,000. Market research shows that Apple draws its customers from
<font color="#6b8e23">higher income demographics </font>than the

displays </font>from its product line as part of aesthetic design and
space-saving measures with the iMac G4. However, the new iMac, which
featured a flexible LCD flat panel display, was significantly more
expensive than the previous iMac G3 when it was first introduced,
largely due to <font color="#dcdcdc">the higher cost of LCD
technology at the time. </font>To keep the Macintosh affordable <font color="#2f4f4f">in
the education market </font>and to address the obsolescence of the
iMac G3, Apple created the eMac in April 2002 as its intended
successor. However, the eMac's display tube made it <font color="#556b2f">relatively
bulky and somewhat outdated</font>, and its all-in-one design meant
that it could not be expanded to meet the demand for larger displays.
The relatively high prices of the iMac G4 approached the prices of
notebooks, which were portable and had higher resolution LCD
displays. At the same time, Windows PC manufacturers were able to
offer desktops with flat LCD displays at a price comparable to the
eMac and at a much lower price than the iMac G4. The failure of the
Power Mac G4 Cube, together with the more expensive iMac G4 and the
heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the
market share achieved by the previous iMac G3. For the next
half-decade, Macintosh sales remained stable, but instead <font color="#a0522d">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Burrell's innovative design, which
combined the low production costs of the Apple II with the computing
power of Lisa's CPU, the Motorola 68K, caught the attention of Apple
founder Steve Jobs. When he realised that the Macintosh was more
marketable than the Lisa, he began to pay attention to the project.
Raskin left the team in 1981 <font color="#dcdcdc">due to a personal
conflict with Jobs</font>. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said the final
Macintosh design was closer to <font color="#2f4f4f">Jobs' </font>ideas
than Raskin's. After hearing about the groundbreaking GUI technology
being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the
Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange
for <font color="#556b2f">stock options in Apple</font>. Lisa's and
Macintosh's user interfaces were inspired by the technology seen in<font color="#6b8e23">
Xerox PARC, </font>and combined with the Macintosh team's own ideas.
Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work
on the Macintosh line, resulting in the &quot;Snow White&quot; design
language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was
adopted in most other Apple computers in the mid- to late 1980s.
Jobs' leadership of the Macintosh project did not last, however;
<font color="#a0522d">after an internal power struggle </font>with
new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985. He founded
NeXT, another computer company aimed at the education market, and did

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Intel had tried unsuccessfully to
pressure Apple to move the Macintosh platform to <font color="#a9a9a9">Intel
chips</font>. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction
Set Computer) architecture would ultimately not be able to compete
with RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. Although the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Motorola 68040 </font>offered the same features
as the Intel 80486 and could clock significantly faster than the
Intel chip, the 486 clock speed was significantly faster without
suffering from overclocking problems, especially for the clock
doubled i486DX2, which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus
speed, giving IBM-compatible systems with such hardware a significant
performance edge over Macintosh units. Apple's product design and
engineering did not help matters, as it limited the use of the 040
card for a time to its expensive Quadros, while the 486 card was
readily available to OEMs and hobbyists who were assembling their own
machines. In late 1991, when higher-end Macintosh desktops switched
to the 040 card, Apple was unable to offer the 040 card on its
high-end PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series,
several years after the first IBM-compatible laptops with the 486
operating system came on the market, causing Apple to lose
substantial sales. In 1993, <font color="#2f4f4f">Intel introduced
</font>Pentium processors as successors to the 486, while Motorola's
68050 processor was never released, <font color="#6b8e23">leaving</font>
the Macintosh platform <font color="#556b2f">a generation </font><font color="#6b8e23">behind
</font>IBM-compatible laptops in terms of the latest processor
technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola's processors and
switched to the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM
alliance of Apple Computer, IBM and Motorola. The Power Macintosh
model, the first to use the new chipsets, proved to be a great
success, with over one million PowerPC units sold in nine months. In
the long run, however, abandoning Intel for PowerPC was a mistake, as
the proliferation of Intel architecture chips meant that Apple could
not compete on price with the 'Dells of the world'.</p>

to the Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first
consumer-level laptop, which filled the missing quarter of Apple's
'four-square product matrix' (desktops and laptops for both consumers
and professionals). More than 140 000 pre-orders were placed before
shipments began in September, and it proved to be a huge success in
October.</p>

microprocessors in <font color="#a9a9a9">2006</font>. At WWDC 2005,
Steve Jobs announced the move and revealed that Mac OS X has always
been developed to run on both Intel and PowerPC architectures. All
new Mac computers now use Intel x86 processors and some were renamed
as a result. Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.6 and later (support
has been discontinued since 10.7) can run software developed for
PowerPC using an emulator called Rosetta, albeit at a significantly
slower speed than native software. However, the Classic environment
is not available on Intel architecture. Intel chips made it possible
to run Microsoft's Windows operating system natively on Apple
hardware without the need for emulation software such as Virtual PC.
In March 2006, <font color="#dcdcdc">a group of hackers </font>announced
that they were able to run Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac. The
group released their software as open source and made it <font color="#2f4f4f">available
for download on their website</font>. <font color="#556b2f">On 5
April </font>2006, Apple announced the availability of a public beta
version of <font color="#6b8e23">Boot Camp</font>. Boot Camp is
software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP
on their machines; later versions added support for Windows Vista and
Windows 7. Classic was removed in Mac OS X 10.5, and Boot Camp became
a standard feature on Intel-based Macs.</p>

Before the war, it was known that ammunition had to explode <font color="#a9a9a9">in

<font color="#2f4f4f">incendiary (based on a burning fuse) or
mechanical (clockwork).</font> Detonators were not well suited to
anti-aircraft use. The length of the fuse was determined by the time
of flight, but the height affected the rate of combustion of the
powder. British bombers were equipped only with touch-fired
ammunition. <font color="#556b2f">Zeppelins, which </font>were
propellant-filled balloons, were the targets of incendiary grenades,
and the British introduced fuzes with airburst fuzes that were both
shrapnel-type - projecting the front of the incendiary grenade &quot;pot&quot;
and throwing the fuse stream at the base. The British also fitted
their grenades with tracers for night use. <font color="#6b8e23">Smoke

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The British approach to HAA firing
was based on two assumptions: first, <font color="#a9a9a9">targeting
</font>was the preferred method, and this was made possible by
anticipating the artillery data from visual observation of the target
and <font color="#dcdcdc">its height</font>. Second, it was assumed
that the target would maintain a constant course, <font color="#2f4f4f">speed
and altitude</font>. This HAA was expected to fire targets up to
<font color="#556b2f">24,000 feet</font>. <font color="#6b8e23">Mechanical
</font>time fuses were needed instead of fuse wire because the rate
of combustion of gunpowder varied with altitude, so the length of the
fuse was not a function of flight time alone. Automatic firing
guaranteed a constant speed, which made it easier to predict where
each shell should be aimed individually.</p>

which had two functions (anti-aircraft and anti-ground)</font>. It
was standardised in 1927 as the T9 AA gun, but trials quickly
revealed that it was useless in ground combat. Although the grenade
was somewhat light (well under 2 lbs), it still had a good power
ceiling and fired shots at 125 rounds per minute; the AA tank was
developed and introduced in 1939. The Browning 37 mm grenade proved
prone to jamming, and was eventually replaced in AA units by the<font color="#556b2f">

<font color="#6b8e23">the US Navy</font>, but none was acquired

developed a mobile anti-aircraft gun mounted on the rear of a heavy

</font>introduced an <font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;effective upper
limit&quot;</font>, meaning the height at which a gun could fire a
series of shells against a moving target; this could be limited both
by the maximum fuse life and the capacity of the gun. In the late
1930s, the British definition was 'the height at which a target
approaching directly at 400 mph (=643.6 km/h) can be engaged for <font color="#2f4f4f">20
seconds </font>before the gun reaches an altitude of 70 degrees'.

distance to the target and the <font color="#2f4f4f">angle of

These were complex instruments and there were several other methods
in use. The HRF was soon joined by the <font color="#556b2f">Height/Fuse

or airship guns </font>on land and in naval use were attracting
attention. Various types of ammunition were proposed: explosives,

cannon. Erhardt also had a 12-pounder, while Vickers Maxim offered a
3-pounder and Schneider a 47 mm gun. <font color="#6b8e23">A French
balloon gun </font>appeared in 1910, it was an 11-pounder, but it was
mounted on a vehicle and had a total unmanned weight of 2 tons.

anti-aircraft guns, often based on smaller field guns, notably <font color="#a9a9a9">the
French 75 mm and Russian 76.2 mm guns</font>, which usually just
leaned on some kind of embankment so that their muzzles were aimed at
the sky. The British Army quickly adopted the 13-pounder by producing
new mounts suitable for AA use, the <font color="#dcdcdc">13-pdr QF 6
cwt Mk III </font>was released in 1915. It remained in use throughout
the war, but <font color="#2f4f4f">the 18-pdr guns </font>were
aligned downwards to take the 13-pdr shot of the larger cartridge
13-pr QF 9 cwt, and these proved much more satisfactory. Overall,
however, these temporary solutions proved largely useless. Because
the gunners had little experience of the task and no means of
measuring target, distance, elevation or velocity, and because it was
difficult for them to observe the explosion of their ammunition in
relation to the target, the gunners were unable to <font color="#556b2f">get
the fuse setting right</font>, and most of the ammunition exploded
<font color="#6b8e23">well below the target</font>. An exception to
this rule was the use of balloon-protecting guns, where the height
could be accurately measured from the length of the wire holding the
balloon.</p>

ineffective. The naval 3-inch was also introduced into the army, the
QF 3-inch 20 cwt (76 mm), a new field gun introduced in 1916. As most

British </font>introduced a new instrument developed by Vickers. It
was a mechanical analogue computer, the <font color="#dcdcdc">Predictor
AA No 1</font>. When the height of the target was given, its
operators followed the target, and the predictor produced the
bearing, quadrant height and fuze settings. This information was
transmitted electronically to the guns, where it was displayed on
repeater scales to the layers who &quot;matched the pointers&quot;
(target data and actual gun data) to the gun emplacement. This system
of electronic repeaters was based on arrangements introduced by the
British Coast Artillery in the 1880s, and many AA officers worked for
the Coast Artillery. Similar systems were introduced in other
countries, and for example the later Sperry device, known as the <font color="#2f4f4f">M3A3</font>
in the United States<font color="#2f4f4f">, </font>was also used in
Britain as the <font color="#556b2f">Predictor AA No 2. </font>Altimeters
also grew, and in the UK the World War I Barr &amp; Stroud UB 2 (7
foot optical base) was replaced <font color="#6b8e23">by the UB 7 </font>(9
foot optical base) and UB 10 (18 foot optical base, used only in
static AA stations). Goertz in Germany and Levallois in France
produced 5 metre instruments. In most countries, however, HAA guns
were developed until the mid-1930s mainly as improvements to existing
guns, although various new designs were on the drawing boards.</p>

Although they are quite similar, they differ in many key aspects of
phonology, vocabulary, grammar and syntax. Vedic Sanskrit is the
language of <font color="#8b0000">the Vedas</font>, a vast collection
of hymns, incantations (Samhitas) and theological and religious
philosophical discussions in the Brahmanas and Upanishads. Modern
linguists consider <font color="#483d8b">the metrical hymns of </font><font color="#3cb371">the
Rigveda Samhita to </font>be the earliest, composed by many authors
over several centuries of oral tradition. The end of the Vedic period
is marked by the <font color="#663399">Upanishads</font><font color="#bc8f8f">,
which </font>form the last part of the traditional Vedic corpus;
however, the early Sutras are also Vedic in both language and

Valencian and <font color="#a9a9a9">Spanish </font>are the <font color="#dcdcdc">two
</font>official languages<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font> Spanish is
the official language in the whole of Spain, while Valencian is the
official language in the Valencian Country and in Catalonia and the
Balearic Islands, where it is called Catalan. Despite the different
denomination, the different dialects and the political tensions
between Catalonia and Valencia, <font color="#2f4f4f">Catalan </font>and
Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties
of the same language<br/>
Valencian has historically been suppressed
in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more pronounced in the
cities proper, while in rural and metropolitan areas the language has
remained active. After the unification of Castile and Aragon, the
Spanish-speaking elite became established in the city. In more recent
history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative
apparatus in Valencia further excluded the Valencians from public
life.<br/>
Valencian language regained its official status, prestige
and use in education after the transition to democracy in
1978<br/>
However, due to industrialisation in recent
decades<br/>
Valencianlanguage has attracted immigrants from other
regions of Spain, so there is also a demographic factor behind the
decline in its social use. Due to a combination of these reasons,
Valencia has become a bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, where
Valencianism is seen as merely folkloric but rejects the current
standard, adapted from Catalan orthography. <br/>
Spanish is

education system, most Valencians know both Spanish and Valencian,
and both can be used in the city. Valencia is therefore the second
largest Catalan-speaking city after Barcelona. The official buildings
and streets are named after Valencian names. The city also has many
pro-Valencian political and civil organisations. Valencian education
is provided in over<font color="#6b8e23">70 </font>state-owned

century, a </font>dome was added and the rear of the choir was
extended, connecting the building to the tower and forming the main
entrance<font color="#a9a9a9">. </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Archbishop
Luis Alfonso de los Cameros </font>began construction of the main
chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marble and bronze in
the Baroque style of the time. The façade of the main entrance was
built in the early <font color="#2f4f4f">1700s by the </font>German
architect Conrad Rudolphus. Two other doors lead into the transept;
one, a purely pointed <font color="#556b2f">Gothic </font>apostolic
door, dates from the 13th century, the other is a palace door.
Additions to the rear of the cathedral detract from its height. The
17th-century restoration rounded off the pointed arches, covered the
Gothic columns with Corinthian columns and redecorated the walls. The
cathedral has no lantern and its simple roof is pierced by two large
side windows. There are four chapels on either side, plus the one at
the end and those opening onto the choir, the transept and the
sanctuary. The church contains many paintings by important artists.
The silver reredos behind the altar was taken away in the war of 1808
and converted into coins to cover the costs of the campaign. The
chapel of San Francesco has two paintings by <font color="#6b8e23">Francisco
Goya.</font> Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small
Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Next to the cathedral is a

Valencia, then called Balansiyya, flourished from the 10th century

Miguelete and the Chapel of the Kings of the Convent of Santo
Domingo. In painting and sculpture, Flemish and Italian trends
influenced artists such as Lluís Dalmau, Peris Gonçal and Damià
Formenti. Literature flourished under the patronage of the court of
Alfonso the Magnanimous, which supported writers such as Ausiàs
March, Roiç de Corella and Isabel de Villena. In 1460, Joanot
Martorell wrote <font color="#dcdcdc">Tirant lo Blanch</font>, an

the former Kingdom of Aragon, where they accounted for a fifth of the
population, and especially in the Valencian region, where they

and the bankruptcy of Taula de Canvi in1613 . The Crown sought to
compensate the nobles who had lost much of their agricultural labour;
this damaged the city's economy for generations to come. Later,
during the so-called Catalan Revolt (1640-1652), Valencia supported

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The inevitable progression of the
civil war and fighting in Madrid led to the capital of the Republic
being moved to Valencia. On 6 November 1936, the city became the
Spanish capital of the Republic <font color="#a9a9a9">under the
leadership of </font>Prime Minister <font color="#a9a9a9">Manuel
Azana</font>; the government moved to the<font color="#dcdcdc"> Palau
de Benicarló </font>and the ministries to different buildings. The
city was heavily bombed from the air and sea, and <font color="#2f4f4f">more
than two hundred </font>bomb shelters had to be built to protect the
population. On <font color="#556b2f">13 January </font>1937, the city
was bombed for the first time by an Italian fascist navy ship that
had blockaded the port on the orders of Benito Mussolini. The bombing
intensified, causing massive destruction on several occasions; by the
end of the war, the city had survived 442 bombings, killing 2,831
people and wounding 847. However, the death toll is estimated to have
been higher, as the figures given are those acknowledged by the
Francisco Franco government. The republican government was
transferred to Juan Negrín on 17 May 1937, and on 31 October of the
same year it moved <font color="#6b8e23">to Barcelona</font>. On 30
March 1939, Valencia surrendered and the city was invaded by
Nationalist troops. The post-war years were a period of hardship for
the Valencian people. Under Franco's regime, speaking and teaching
the Valencian language was forbidden, but now it is compulsory for
every Valencian schoolchild.</p>

These included the War of the Union, the uprising against the

and the war with Castile, which forced the urgent construction of a
new wall against Castilian attacks in 1363 and 1364. The coexistence
of the three communities living in the city during these years -
Christians<font color="#dcdcdc">, Jews and Muslims - </font>was
highly controversial. The Jews, who lived on the coast, had advanced
economically and socially, and their district was gradually expanding
at the expense of the neighbouring communities. At the same time, the
Muslims who remained in the city after the conquest settled in the
Moorish quarter next to the present <font color="#2f4f4f">Mosen Sorel

for a new Gothic building with three naves, which extend only to the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the first two years,
Confederate troops did well in the fighting, but lost control of the
border states. The Confederacy had the advantage of defending a very
large area of land where disease caused twice as many deaths as
fighting. The Union strategy was to take the coast, blockade the
ports and take over the river systems. By 1863, the Confederacy was
strangling. Its eastern armies fought well, but the western armies
were defeated one by one until Union troops captured New Orleans on
the Tennessee River <font color="#a9a9a9">in 1862. </font>In the
famous Vicksburg Campaign of 1862-63, <font color="#dcdcdc">Ulysses
Grant </font>captured the Mississippi River and cut off the

several battles with very heavy losses, he had Lee besiege Richmond

Atlanta and marched through Georgia and the Carolinas. The
Confederate capital was abandoned in April 1865, and Lee then
surrendered <font color="#556b2f">at Appomattox Court House</font>;
all other Confederate armies surrendered within a few months.</p>

</font>OSUT (<font color="#556b2f">One Station Unit Training)</font>,
which combines basic training and AIT. The length of AIT training
varies according to the MOS The length of time spent in AIT depends
on the soldier's MOS, and some highly technical MOSs may require
several months of training (e.g. foreign language translators).
Depending on the needs of the Army, Basic Combat Training (BTC) for

the Cold War was coming to an end. The military leadership responded
by initiating plans to reduce its strength. By November 1989, a
Pentagon briefing outlined plans to reduce the final strength of the

Several incentives were used, including early retirement. In 1990,

to acquire fixed-wing aircraft. In 1910, a civil war was fought in
Mexico, with peasant rebels fighting against government soldiers. The
army was sent to American towns near the border to ensure the safety
of lives and property. In 1916, <font color="#dcdcdc">Pancho Villa</font>,
a prominent rebel leader, attacked Columbus, New Mexico, leading to
US intervention in Mexico until <font color="#2f4f4f">7 February
1917.</font> The rebels and Mexican federal troops were fought until
1918. The United States entered World War I in 1917 on the side of
Britain, France, Russia, Italy and other allies. US troops were sent
to the Western Front and were involved in the final offensives that
ended the war. With the November 1918 armistice, the army again
reduced its forces.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the 1960s, the Ministry of
Defence continued to review the reserve forces, questioning the
number of divisions and brigades and whether it was unnecessary to
maintain two reserve components, the Army National Guard and the Army
Reserve. In 1967, Defence Secretary <font color="#a9a9a9">Robert
McNamara </font>decided that 15 combat divisions in the Army National
Guard were unnecessary and cut the number to divisions8 (1 infantry
division, 2 armoured infantry divisions and 5 infantry divisions),
but increased the number of brigades from seven to seven (181 Air
Brigade, 1 Armoured Infantry Division, 1 Armoured Infantry Division,
2 Infantry Divisions and 14 Infantry Divisions). The loss of the
divisions did not please the States. Their objections included <font color="#556b2f">the
inadequate manoeuvre element composition of the remaining divisions
and the cessation of the rotation of divisional command procedures
between the states supporting them</font>. It was proposed that the
commanders of the remaining divisions should reside in the state
where the division's base was located. However, the overall strength
of the Army National Guard would not be reduced, which persuaded the
governors to accept the plan. The states reorganised their forces

by Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, took advantage of this
manoeuvre and pinned down the French. He left the Prussian First and
Second Armies to besiege Metz, with the exception of three

annexed numerous territories and formed <font color="#dcdcdc">the

French Emperor Napoleon III demanded compensation to safeguard
France's strategic position in Belgium and on the left bank of the
Rhine, which Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck flatly refused.
Prussia then turned its attention to southern Germany, where it
sought to incorporate the southern German kingdoms of Bavaria,
Württemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt into a unified Prussian-ruled
Germany. France <font color="#6b8e23">strongly opposed the new union

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The French army in peacetime
consisted of about 400<font color="#a9a9a9">,000 </font>soldiers,
some of them regulars and some conscripts, who until 1869 served a
relatively long period of seven years in the military service. Some
of them were veterans of previous French campaigns in the Crimean
War, Algeria, the <font color="#dcdcdc">Franco-Austrian War </font>in
Italy and the Franco-Mexican War. However, after the 'Seven Weeks'
War' between <font color="#2f4f4f">Prussia and Austria </font>four
years earlier, it had been calculated that the French army could only
send 288 000 men against the Prussian army when it needed perhaps 1
000 000. Under the leadership of <font color="#556b2f">Marshal
Adolphe Niel, </font>urgent reforms were made. Universal conscription
(instead of the previous voting system) and a shorter period of
service increased the number of reservists, increasing the army's
planned strength of 800,000 soldiers in the event of mobilisation.
Those who could not for some reason be called up for conscription
were to be recruited <font color="#6b8e23">into the Garde Mobile</font>,
a militia with a nominal strength of 400 000. However, the
Franco-Prussian War broke out before these reforms could be fully
implemented. The mobilisation of reservists was chaotic and resulted
in large numbers of stragglers, and the Garde Mobile was generally
untrained and often mutinous.</p>

outnumbered, the French defended their positions outside
Fröschwiller. By the afternoon, the Germans had lost some 10 500
killed or wounded, while the French had lost the same number of
killed, and some 9 200 men had been taken prisoner, representing a
loss of about 50 %. The Germans took Fröschwiller, which was
situated on a hilltop in the middle of the French line. Having lost
all hope of victory and threatened with bloodshed, the French broke
away and retreated west towards Bitche and Saverne, hoping to join
the French forces on the other side of the Vosges mountains. The
German 3rd Army did not pursue the French, but remained in <font color="#6b8e23">Alsace

march his army behind the fortifications and fight the Prussians in
open battle. The army was severely weakened by low morale, supply
problems, terrible winter weather and poor quality of troops, and
General Faidherbe was unable to lead the army because of his poor

engine failures; only the tower ship <font color="#2f4f4f">SMS

repairs were completed, the French fleet had already set sail. The
blockade was only partially successful due to crucial mistakes made
by Parisian planners. The reservists, who had to be ready in case of
war, worked in the Newfoundland fisheries or in Scotland. Only some
of the <font color="#556b2f">470 ships of </font>the French navy went
to sea on 24 July. Before long, the French navy was running low on
coal, needing 200 short tons (180 t) a day and with a bunker capacity
of only 250 short tons (230 t). The blockade of Wilhelmshaven failed,
and conflicting orders for operations in the Baltic or a return to
France made the French navy's efforts futile. Detecting the blockade
became an unpleasant experience because of the question du charbon;
the pursuit of Prussian ships quickly exhausted the French ships'

four divisions out to a </font>distance of 32 kilometres (<font color="#2f4f4f">20

organisation of the troops was due to a shortage of supplies, which
forced each division to search for basic supplies in conjunction with

them. The bad situation was made much worse by the behaviour of the
commander of the <font color="#6b8e23">1st Division</font>, <font color="#556b2f">General

commander of the 2nd Division, on 1 August that 'from the information
I have received, I assume that the enemy has no significant troops
very close to his front lines and has no desire to attack'. Two days
later he told MacMahon that he had not found 'any enemy positions ...
it seems to me that the Bavarian threat is a bluff'. Although Ducrot
dismissed the possibility of a German attack, MacMahon tried to warn
the other divisions of his army without success.</p>

With most of the remaining French armies dug in near Paris, the
German leaders decided to put pressure on the enemy by attacking
Paris. By 15 September, German troops had reached the outskirts of
the fortified city. On 19 September, the Germans surrounded it and
