&quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;. Beyoncé took a break
from music in 2010 and took control of her career; her fourth album 4
(2011) was then more gentle in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop
and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth studio album, Beyoncé
(2013), differed from previous releases in its experimental
production and exploration of darker themes.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#dcdcdc">At the age of
eight, </font>Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia
Roberson when they were auditioning for a girls' entertainment group.
They were placed with three other girls in a group called<font color="#2f4f4f">
Girl's Tyme</font>, rapping and dancing at a talent show in Houston.
After seeing the group, R&amp;B producer <font color="#556b2f">Arne
Frager </font>brought them to his studio in Northern California and
placed them on Star Search, which at the time was the largest
national television talent show. Girl's Tyme did not win, and Beyoncé
later said that the song they performed was not good. In <font color="#a0522d">1995</font>,<font color="#a0522d">
Beyoncé's father </font>quit his job to manage the group. The move
halved Beyoncé's family income, and her parents had to move into
separate flats. Mathew cut the original line-up to four, and the
group continued to perform as opening acts for other established R&amp;B
girl groups. The girls auditioned for record labels and eventually
landed a contract <font color="#228b22">with Elektra Records</font>,
and briefly moved to Atlanta Records to work on their first record,
but the label cut them. This put even more strain on the family, and
Beyoncé's parents divorced. On 5 October 1995, <font color="#191970">Dwayne
Wiggins' Grass Roots Entertainment </font>signed the band. In 1996,
the girls began recording their debut album under a deal with <font color="#8b0000">Sony
Music</font>, the Knowles family reunited, and soon after the group
was signed to Columbia Records.</p>

</font>2008, Beyoncé married <font color="#dcdcdc">Jay Z</font><font color="#2f4f4f">.
</font>She publicly revealed the marriage <font color="#556b2f">in a
video montage for </font>her third studio album I Am... <font color="#6b8e23">Sasha
Fierce</font>, at the Sony Club in Manhattan on 22 October 2008. I
Am... Sasha Fierce was released on <font color="#a0522d">18 November
2008 in the United States.</font> The album officially introduces
Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, who was born while making her 2003
single Crazy in Love. It sold 482 000 copies in its first week,
topping the Billboard 200 and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive
number one album in the US. The album included the number one song
&quot;<font color="#228b22">Single Ladies </font>(Put a Ring on It)&quot;
and the top five songs &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; and &quot;Halo&quot;.
&quot;Halo&quot; achieved the longest-running Hot 100 single of her
career, and its success in the US helped Beyoncé achieve more top 10
singles on the chart than any other woman <font color="#191970">in
the 2000s.</font> It also included the successful &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;
and the singles &quot;Diva&quot;, &quot;Ego&quot;, &quot;Broken-Hearted
Girl&quot; and &quot;Video Phone&quot;. The music video for Single
Ladies has been parodied and imitated around the world and, according
to the Toronto Star, gave birth to &quot;the first big dance craze of
the internet era&quot;. The video has won several awards, including
Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish
MOBO Awards and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music
Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, of which it
eventually won three, including Video of the Year. Its failure in the
Best Female Video category, which went to American country-pop singer
<font color="#8b0000">Taylor </font>Swift's &quot;You Belong with
Me&quot;, led to <font color="#483d8b">Kanye West </font>interrupting

her husband. Although the film received negative reviews from
critics, it performed well at the US box office, grossing $68 million

- on a $20 million budget. The finale of the fight scene between

her as a mother and businesswoman, recording, training for live
performances and her return to the limelight after the birth of Blue
Ivy. Her DVD release in November 2013 was accompanied by footage from
Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live concerts and the new song &quot;God

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">On 13 December
</font>2013, Beyoncé unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth
studio album <font color="#dcdcdc">on the iTunes Store </font>without
any prior announcement or advertising. The album debuted at the top
of the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive
number one album in the US. This made her the first woman in chart
history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one.
Beyoncé enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success, selling <font color="#2f4f4f">one
million </font>digital copies worldwide in six days; the album's
unusual and unexpected release was hailed by The New York Times as
significant. Musically, the electro-R&amp;B album deals with darker
themes not previously explored in her output, such as &quot;bulimia,
postpartum depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage
and motherhood&quot;. The single &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Drunk in
Love&quot;, </font>featuring <font color="#6b8e23">Jay Z</font>,
reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. In April 2014, Beyoncé
and Jay Z officially announced <font color="#a0522d">their On the Run
tour, after </font>much speculation in the weeks leading up to it. On
24 August 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV
Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competing awards:
for Best Social Message Video and Best Cinematography for &quot;Pretty
Hurts&quot; and Best Collaboration for &quot;Drunk in Love&quot;. In
November, <font color="#228b22">Forbes </font>reported that Beyoncé
was the highest-earning woman in music for the second year in a row -
she earned $115 million a year, <font color="#191970">more than
double her earnings </font>in 2013. Beyoncé was re-released with new
material in three formats: an extended play, a box set and a full
platinum edition.</p>

February 2015, Beyoncé was nominated for <font color="#a9a9a9">six
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">awards</font>, of which she eventually
won <font color="#2f4f4f">three</font>: for Best R&amp;B Performance,
Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;Drunk in Love&quot; and Best Surround
Sound Album. She was nominated for Album of the Year, but the award
was won by <font color="#556b2f">Beck </font>for her album Morning
Phase. In August, the cover of the September issue of Vogue magazine
was launched online, and Beyoncé was the cover star, becoming the
first African-American artist and the third African-American woman
ever to appear on the cover of the September issue. She headlined the
2015 Made in America Festival in early September and later that
month, the Global Citizen Festival. Beyoncé made an undeserved
appearance on the song &quot;Hymn for the Weekend&quot; by British
rock band <font color="#a0522d">Coldplay, from </font>their seventh
studio album A Head Full of Dreams (2015), released in December. On 7
January 2016, Pepsi announced that Beyoncé would perform alongside
Coldplay at Super Bowl 50 in February. Knowles has previously
appeared in four Super Bowl shows during her career, and she served
as the 47th headliner. She headlined the Super Bowl halftime show in
2013.</p>

<font color="#dcdcdc">Paris</font>. After this, he only made a few
public appearances in the last 18 years of his life30, as he
preferred the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported
himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he
was in great demand. Chopin became friends with <font color="#556b2f">Franz
Liszt </font>and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries,
including Robert Schumann. In <font color="#6b8e23">1835 he was
granted </font>French citizenship. After an unsuccessful engagement
to <font color="#a0522d">Maria Wodzińska, </font>he had an often
uneasy relationship with the French writer George Sand from 1837 to
1847. A brief and unhappy stay <font color="#228b22">in Mallorca </font>with
Sand in 1838-39 was one of his most productive periods of
composition. In his last years he was financially supported by his
admirer <font color="#191970">Jane Stirling, </font>who also arranged
for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Chopin suffered from ill health
for most of his life. He died in Paris in 1849, probably <font color="#8b0000">of

piano, but he also wrote two piano concertos, some chamber pieces and

keyboard playing style is very individual and often technically
demanding; his own performances are known for <font color="#2f4f4f">their
subtlety and sensitivity</font>. Chopin invented the concept of <font color="#556b2f">the
instrumental ballad</font>. His most important piano works also

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">At the end of 1831, Chopin received
his first major endorsement from a prominent contemporary when <font color="#dcdcdc">Robert
Schumann </font>criticised the Op. 2 Variations in the Allgemeine
musikalische Zeitung (his first published article on music) and said:
'Hat off, gentlemen! Genius.&quot; On <font color="#2f4f4f">26
February 1832, </font>Chopin gave his Paris debut concert at the
Salle Pleyel, to universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph
Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: &quot;Here is a young
man who ... has not taken his cue, has found, if not a complete
innovation in piano music, ... a wealth of original ideas not to be
found anywhere else ...'. After this concert, Chopin realised that
his essentially <font color="#556b2f">intimate </font><font color="#6b8e23">keyboard
technique </font>was not optimal for large concert halls. Later that
year, he was introduced to the wealthy <font color="#a0522d">Rothschild
</font>banking family, whose patronage opened the doors to other
private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and the artistic
and literary elite). By the end of 1832, Chopin had established
himself among the Parisian musical elite and earned the respect of
colleagues such as Hiller, Liszt and Berlioz. No longer financially
dependent on <font color="#228b22">his father</font>, in the winter
of 1832 he began to earn a handsome income <font color="#191970">by
publishing his works and teaching piano to wealthy students from all
over </font>Europe. This freed him from the burdens of public
performance, which he detested.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Chopin rarely performed in public in
Paris. In his later years, he usually gave a concert once a year <font color="#a9a9a9">at
the Salle Pleyel</font>, which seated 300 people. He performed more
often in salons, but preferred to play to <font color="#dcdcdc">small
groups of friends in his own Paris </font><font color="#2f4f4f">apartment.</font>
Musicologist Arthur Hedley has noted that 'as a pianist, Chopin was
unique in that he achieved his highest reputation on the basis of few
public appearances - only a handful of over thirty in his lifetime'.
A list of musicians who attended some of his concerts gives an
indication of the richness of the artistic life in Paris at that
time. Examples include the concert of 23 March 1833, at which Chopin,
<font color="#556b2f">Liszt and Hiller </font>performed (<font color="#6b8e23">on
pianos) </font>J.S. Bach's Concerto for Three Keyboards, and the
concert of 3 March 1838, at which Chopin, his pupil <font color="#a0522d">Adolphe
Gutmann</font>, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Alkan's teacher Joseph
Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement for eight hands of two
movements from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. Chopin also contributed
to the composition of Liszt's <font color="#228b22">Hexameron</font>;
he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's
music soon became a success with publishers, and in 1833 he signed a
contract with <font color="#191970">Maurice Schlesinger</font>, who
arranged for his music to be published not only in France but also
through his family connections in Germany and England.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the spring of 1834, Chopin and
<font color="#dcdcdc">Hiller </font>attended <font color="#a9a9a9">a
music festival in the lower reaches of </font>Aix-la-Chapelle, where
Chopin met <font color="#2f4f4f">Felix Mendelssohn</font>. After the
festival they went together to <font color="#556b2f">Düsseldorf</font>,
where Mendelssohn had been appointed music director. They spent what
Mendelssohn described as a &quot;very pleasant day&quot;, <font color="#6b8e23">playing
and discussing music </font>on his piano and meeting <font color="#a0522d">Friedrich
Wilhelm Schadow, </font><font color="#228b22">the director of the
Academy of Arts, </font>and some of his notable students, including
Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835, Chopin travelled
to <font color="#191970">Carlsbad to </font>spend time with his
parents; it was the last time he saw them. On his way back to Paris,
he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had met their
daughter <font color="#8b0000">Maria </font>in Poland five years
earlier, when she was eleven years old. This meeting prompted him to
stay in Dresden for two weeks, although he had previously planned to
return to Paris via Leipzig. This portrait of the composer by a
sixteen-year-old girl is considered, along with Delacroix's, to be
one of Chopin's best portraits. In October, she finally arrived in
Leipzig, where she met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn,
who arranged for her to perform his oratorio St Paul and considered
her 'a perfect musician'. <font color="#483d8b">In July 1836 </font>Chopin
travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to visit the Wodziński family,
and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother <font color="#3cb371">Countess
Wodzińska </font>approved in principle. Chopin travelled on to
Leipzig, where he presented his Ballade in G minor to Schumann. At
the end of 1836, he sent Maria an album on which his sister Ludwika
had written seven of his songs, as well as the Nocturne in C sharp
minor, Op. 27 No. 1, composed in 1835. The anodyne thank you from
Maria turned out to be the last letter he received from her.</p>

and admiration for each other, their friendship was unpleasant and

Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin regarded Liszt's virtuosity
in piano playing with &quot;a touch of jealousy and malice&quot;, and
others have also claimed that he was fascinated by Liszt's
<font color="#2f4f4f">theatricality, showmanship and success</font>.
Liszt had dedicated Chopin's <font color="#556b2f">Op. 10 to Étude</font>,
and his performance prompted the composer to write <font color="#6b8e23">to
Hiller</font>: 'I would like to deprive him of the way he plays my
opus'. However, Chopin expressed his exasperation in 1843 when Liszt
performed one of his nocturnes by adding numerous elaborate
ornaments, to which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as
written or not play it at all, forcing him to <font color="#a0522d">apologise.
</font>Most of Chopin's biographers state that after this they had
little more to do with each other, although in his letters of 1848
Chopin still referred to him as '<font color="#228b22">my friend
Liszt'</font>. Some commentators point to events in the men's
romantic lives that led to the discord between them; some claim that
Liszt had shown jealousy over his mistress <font color="#191970">Marie

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1836, Chopin met the French
writer <font color="#dcdcdc">George Sandin </font>(née [Amantine]
Aurore [Lucile] Dupin) at a party organised by <font color="#a9a9a9">Marie
d'Agoult</font>. Short (less than five feet, or 152 cm), dark,
wide-eyed and cigar-smoking, Chopin was at first repulsed by the
woman, who said: 'What an unpleasant person la Sand is. Is she really
a woman?&quot; However, Maria <font color="#2f4f4f">1837Wodzińska's
</font>mother had already made it clear to Chopin in correspondence
early in the year that marriage to her daughter was unlikely to go
ahead. It is thought that the mother was influenced by <font color="#556b2f">Chopin's
poor health </font>and possibly also by rumours of his courtship with
women like d'Agoult and Sand. In the end, Chopin put the letters from
Maria and her mother in a package, on which he wrote '<font color="#6b8e23">Tragediani</font>'
in Polish. In a letter to <font color="#a0522d">Grzymała in </font>June
1838, Sand acknowledged his strong feelings for the composer and
wondered whether he should give up his ongoing relationship to begin
a relationship with Chopin; he asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's
relationship with Maria Wodzińska, not realising that it was over,
at least on Maria's part.</p>

contempt. As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less
a lover than a <font color="#6b8e23">carer for </font>Chopin, whom he
called his '<font color="#a0522d">third child</font>'. In her letters
to third parties, she expressed her impatience and spoke of Chopin as
a 'child', a 'little angel', 'suffering' and 'loving his little
body'. In 1847, Sand published his novel <font color="#191970">Lucrezia
Floriani</font>, whose protagonists - a rich actress and an ailing
prince - could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was
unpopular with Chopin, who could not help but notice the allusions
when he helped Sand repair the galleys in the printing press. In 1847
he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year
relationship after an angry exchange of letters which, in Sand's

friendship'. They never met again.</p>

invited him to visit <font color="#a9a9a9">Scotland</font>, where he
stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and Johnstone Castle in
Renfrewshire, both owned by members of the Stirling family. Chopin
clearly had the impression that there would be no more than
friendship, and Chopin had to make it clear to him that this could
not be the case. He wrote to Grzymała at the time: 'My Scottish
women are kind, but so dull', and in response to a rumour about his
involvement, he replied that he was 'nearer the grave than the
marriage bed'. He gave a public concert <font color="#dcdcdc">in
Glasgow </font>on 27 September and another in Edinburgh, at the
Hopetoun Rooms (now Erskine House) on Queen Street, on 4 October. In

with the Polish doctor <font color="#2f4f4f">Adam Łyszczyński</font>,

and he used Clement's piano method with his own pupils. He was also

by Hummel. He cited <font color="#2f4f4f">Bach and Mozart as </font>two
of the most important composers who influenced his musical outlook.
Chopin's early works follow the style of the 'brilliant' keyboard
players of his time, as exemplified by the works of Ignaz Moscheles,
Friedrich Kalkbrenner and others. In the earlier period, the
influences of Polish folk music and Italian opera are less direct.
Much of his characteristic style of ornamentation (e.g. the foritura)
derives from singing. His melodic lines increasingly resembled the
modes and features of his native music, such as drones.</p>

view, 'merely instruments for brilliant piano playing ... formally
long-winded and extremely conservative'. After the Piano Concertos
(both of which are early, dating from 1830), Chopin did not attempt
large-scale polyphonic forms, with the exception of his late sonatas
for piano and cello; &quot;instead, he achieved near perfection in
works whose overall structure is simple but whose cellular structure
is subtle and complex&quot;. Rosen suggests that an important part of

patterns in the accompaniment&quot;, and cadences are delayed by
using chords outside the home key (neapolitan sixths and diminished
sevenths) or by abruptly shifting to more distant keys. The

Escudier </font>wrote of a concert given by Chopin that year: 'It may
be said that Chopin is the creator of the piano school and the school
of composition. In fact, nothing compares with the lightness and
sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover,
nothing compares with his works, which are full of originality,
refinement and grace.&quot; Chopin refused to conform to a
standardised way of playing and believed that there was no one
technique that could be used to play well. His style was largely
based on a very <font color="#dcdcdc">independent finger technique</font>.
<font color="#2f4f4f">In his Projet de méthode </font>he wrote:
&quot;Everything is a matter of knowing how to use good finger
feeling ... equally, you need the rest of the hand, the wrist, the
forearm and the upper arm.&quot; He also stated that &quot;one only
needs to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys
to easily achieve the most beautiful tone quality, to know how to
play short and long notes, and [to achieve] unlimited dexterity.&quot;
Consequences of this technical approach in Chopin's music include the
general use of the full range of the keyboard, double chords and
other chord groups, rapidly repeated notes, the use of grace notes,
and contrasting rhythms between the hands (for example, four against
three).</p>

argue that the Ming dynasty had undisputed sovereignty over Tibet,
suggesting that the Ming court granted various titles to Tibetan
leaders, that Tibetans fully accepted these titles, and that the
process of renewing the successors to these titles required travel to
the Ming capital. Scholars working in China also argue that Tibet has
been an integral part of China since the 13th century and was
therefore part of the Ming Empire. However, most non-Chinese
scholars, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein and Helmut
Hoffman, argue that the relationship was one of dominance, that Ming
titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent
territory outside Ming control and that it simply paid tribute until

Nanjing in <font color="#dcdcdc">1371 to pay </font>taxes and show
his loyalty to the Ming court, bringing with him a stamp of authority

of the lamas who had received the title of 'prince' had to travel to
the Ming court to renew this title, and since the lamas called
themselves <font color="#2f4f4f">princes</font>, the Ming court
therefore had 'full sovereignty over Tibet'. They state that the Ming
dynasty subjugated the former Yuan religious and administrative
leaders of the Tibetan regions by issuing <font color="#556b2f">imperial
orders in </font>the early years of its establishment to invite
former Yuan officials to hold court positions, thus bringing the

Chinese. Although Han Chinese hired as advisers were often in fact
more influential than senior officials, their status was not as
clearly defined. Kublai also abolished the imperial examinations
inherited from the Chinese civil service, which were not reintroduced
until the reign of Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan (<font color="#dcdcdc">1311-1320)</font>.
Rossabi writes that Kublai recognised that in order to govern China
'he had to employ Chinese advisers and officials, but he could not
rely entirely on Chinese advisers because he had to maintain a
delicate balance between ruling the sedentary civilisation of China
and preserving Mongol cultural identity and values'. And 'in
governing China, he was concerned not only with the interests of his
Chinese subjects, but also with the exploitation of the empire's
resources for his own benefit'. His motives and objectives varied
throughout his reign,&quot; Rossabi concludes. Van Praag writes in
his book The Status of Tibet that the Tibetans and Mongols, on the
one hand, maintained a dual system of governance and an
interdependent relationship that justified the succession of Mongol
khans as universal Buddhist rulers or chakravartins. Van Praag writes
that &quot;Tibet remained a unique part of the empire and was never
fully integrated into it&quot;, citing examples such as <font color="#2f4f4f">the

this disciple of Chosrje Shākya Yeshes the title of 'king' (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">王</font>).
This title does not seem to have had any practical significance, nor

notes that <font color="#a9a9a9">Chinese communist historians </font>have
failed to understand the importance of the religious dimension of the

the Chinese emperor were an exchange of tribute between &quot;patron

Shangri-La County in Yunnan.</font> Wang and Nyima argue that this
'tribute trade', in which the Ming exchanged Chinese tea for Tibetan
horses while giving Tibetan envoys and Tibetan merchants explicit
permission to trade with Han Chinese merchants, 'promoted the Ming
dynasty's court rule in Tibet'. Rossabi and Sperling point out that
Tibetan horses and Chinese tea were traded long before the Ming.
Peter C. Perdue reports that Wang Anshi (1021-1086), realising that
China could not produce enough militarily capable horses, had also
sought to acquire horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea.
The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draught
animals for army supply wagons. The Tibetans needed Chinese tea not
only as an ordinary drink but also for religious ceremonies. The Ming
government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to
regulate trade in state-controlled markets, but these collapsed in
1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial
pressures on tea-producing areas.</p>

set up diplomatic delegations with Tibet only <font color="#dcdcdc">to
obtain urgently needed horses</font>. Wang and Nyima argue that these
were not diplomatic delegations at all, that the Ming ruled Tibetan
territories because Tibetan leaders were given Ming official status,
that horses were collected from Tibet <font color="#2f4f4f">as a
compulsory &quot;corvée&quot; tax</font>, and that the Tibetans thus
&quot;handled internal affairs, not foreign diplomacy&quot;. Sperling
writes that the Ming were simultaneously buying horses from the Kham
area while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and hosting Tibetan
embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the Tibetan lamas' missions
to the Ming court were largely efforts to promote commercial
transactions between the lamas' large and wealthy entourage and Ming
Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmach writes that although the
Ming pursued a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the
number of Tibetan entourages, the Tibetans sought to maintain a
tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage
provided them with wealth and power. Laird writes that Tibetans
eagerly sought invitations from the Ming court because the gifts
Tibetans received for bringing tribute were worth much more. As for
the Yongle emperor's gifts to his Tibetan and Nepalese vassals, such
as silverware, relics of the Buddha, instruments for Buddhist temples
and religious ceremonies, and monks' robes and robes, Tsai writes
that &quot;the Yongle emperor was quite willing to pay a small price
in an attempt to lure neighbouring states into the Ming orbit to bask
in his glory&quot;. The State Council Information Office of the
People's Republic of China lists the Tibetan tribute goods as oxen,
horses, camels, sheep, fur products, medicinal herbs, Tibetan
incense, thangkas (painted scrolls) and handicrafts, while the Ming
gave Tibetan tribute recipients gold, silver, satin and brocade,
cloth, grains and tea leaves of equal value. Ming-period <font color="#556b2f">silk

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although <font color="#a9a9a9">the

it maintained a policy of banning border markets in the north, which
Laird sees as an attempt to punish the Mongols for their raids and
&quot;drive them from China's borders&quot;. However, when <font color="#2f4f4f">Altan
Khan </font>(1507-1582), leader of the Tümed Mongols who had
overthrown the Aryan <font color="#556b2f">domination of the
Oirat-Mongol alliance</font>, made peace with the Ming dynasty in
1571, he persuaded the Ming to reopen the border market in 1573. This
brought the Chinese a new supply of horses, which the Mongols had too
much of; it was also a relief for the Ming, who were unable to
prevent the Mongols from making regular raids. Laird says that
despite the fact that later Mongols believed that Altan forced the
Ming to consider him an equal, Chinese historians argue that he was
simply a loyal Chinese citizen. By 1578, Altan Khan formed a powerful
Mongol-Tibetan alliance with Gelug, which the Ming watched from afar
without interfering.</p>

with its tributary status when there were no Ming Chinese troops or
governors on its territory. Laird writes that &quot;after the Mongol
troops left Tibet, they were not replaced by Ming troops&quot;. Wang
and Nyima note that despite the fact that the Ming refrained from
sending troops to subdue Tibet and refrained from garrisoning Ming
troops there, these measures were unnecessary as long as the Ming
court maintained close relations with the Tibetan vassals and their
forces. However, there were instances in <font color="#a9a9a9">the

Mongol threat in the north, could not deploy additional military
forces to enforce or support its claims to Tibetan sovereignty;
instead, it resorted to the &quot;Confucian instrument of tribute
relations&quot;, whereby Tibetan lamas were given unlimited titles
and gifts through diplomacy. Sperling notes that the delicate
relationship between the Ming and Tibet was 'the last time a unified
China had to deal with an independent Tibet', that armed conflict
could arise on the Ming's borders and that the ultimate goal of the
Ming's foreign policy towards Tibet was not subjugation but 'avoiding
any threat to Tibet'. P. Christiaan Klieger argues that the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Historians Luciano Petech and Sato
Hisashi argue that the Ming followed a &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">divide

fragmented Tibet after the <font color="#dcdcdc">fall of the Sakya
regime</font>. Chan writes that this may have been a calculated
strategy by the Yongle emperor, as the exclusive protection of one
sect of Tibet would have given it too much territorial power.
Sperling can find no textual evidence in Chinese or Tibetan sources
to support this thesis of Petechi and Hisashi. Norbu argues that
their thesis is largely based on a list of Ming-era titles awarded to
Tibetan lamas rather than on a 'comparative analysis of the
development of China and Tibet'. Rossabi argues that this theory
&quot;gives too much influence to the Chinese&quot; and points out
that Tibet was already politically divided at the beginning of the
Ming dynasty. Rossabi also rejects the 'divide and rule' theory on
the grounds that the Yongle emperor unsuccessfully tried to establish
a strong relationship with <font color="#2f4f4f">the fifth Karmapa,
which </font>he hoped would be similar to Kublai Khan's earlier

Asian Studies, there is no written evidence to suggest that later
Gelug leaders Gendün Drup (1391-1474) and Gendün Gyatso (1475-1571)
had any links with Ming-era China. The primary concern of these two
religious leaders was to deal with the powerful secular Rinpungpa
princes who were the patrons and protectors of the Karma Kargyu
lamas. The Rinpungpa leaders were relatives of <font color="#a9a9a9">Phagmodrupa</font>,
but their authority changed over time from simple governors to rulers
of vast regions of Ü-Tsang. The Rinbung prince occupied Lhasa in

Year ceremonies and prayers</font>, the most important event for the
Gelug. When the task of New Year prayers in Lhasa was given to
Karmapa and others, Gendün Gyatso travelled in exile looking for
allies. However, it was not until the secular <font color="#556b2f">1518Phagmodru
ruler </font>captured Lhasa from Rinbung that the Gelug were given
the rights to perform the New Year prayers. When the Drikung Kagyu
Abbey of Drigung Monastery threatened Lhasa in 1537, Gendün Gyatso
was forced to leave Drepung Monastery, although he eventually
returned.</p>

</font>who enjoyed <font color="#dcdcdc">the company of the lamas </font>at

this was none other than the Rinpung-backed <font color="#2f4f4f">Mikyö
Dorje</font>, the eighth Karmapa lama, who was then living in Lhasa.
Zhengde's top advisers tried their utmost to prevent him from
inviting this lama to court, claiming that Tibetan Buddhism was
wildly unorthodox and unorthodox. Despite the protests of Grand
Secretary Liang Chu, in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent Liu Yun, a
eunuch in the palace household, to invite the Karmapa to Beijing. Liu
commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships recruited along the Yangtze,
and spent 2,835 grams of silver a day on food expenses during his
year-long posting in Chengdu, Sichuan. Having acquired the necessary
gifts for the mission, he set off with a cavalry of about 1 000
soldiers. After the request was delivered, the Karmapa Lama refused
to leave Tibet despite the Ming troops that had been brought to force
him out. Karmapa launched a surprise attack on Liu Yun's camp,
seizing all goods and valuables and killing or wounding half of Liu
Yun's entire convoy. After this fiasco, Liu fled for his life, only
to return to Chengdu several years later to discover that the Zhengde
Emperor was dead.</p>

He also notes that early 20th century Chinese writers described Tibet
as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it. Sperling
attributes this to the fact that 'Tibet was ruled as such by the
Mongol and Manchu empires' and also to the fact that '<font color="#556b2f">the
interfering Ming dynasty of China </font>... had no control over
Tibet'. He writes that the Ming dynasty's relationship with Tibet is
problematic because China has maintained its uninterrupted
sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan
view that Tibet was never under the rule of the Chinese Yuan or Qing
emperors, Sperling also downplays this by stating that Tibet was
&quot;subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing
rulers&quot; and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects
of these emperors.</p>

'teacher of the ocean'. The full title was 'Dalai Lama Vajradhara',
'Vajradhara' being Sanskrit for 'Holder of the Thunderbolt'. Victoria
Huckenpahler points out that Vajradhara is regarded by Buddhists as
the primordial Buddha of unlimited and all-encompassing beneficial
qualities, a being who 'represents the ultimate aspect of
enlightenment'. Goldstein writes that Sönam Gyatso also elevated the
status of the Altan Khan by granting him the title 'King of Religion,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In <font color="#a9a9a9">1565</font>,
the powerful Rinbung princes overthrew one of their own ministers,
Karma Tsete, who called himself Tsangpa, &quot;the one of Tsang&quot;,
and established his power in Shigatse. The second successor to this
first Tsang king, <font color="#dcdcdc">Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, </font>took
control of all of central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) and ruled from <font color="#2f4f4f">1611
to 1621</font>. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa continued to claim
allegiance to both Phagmodru and Gelug, while the king of Ü-Tsang
allied himself with <font color="#556b2f">Karmapa</font>. Tensions
arose between the nationalist Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols, who
protected their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The <font color="#6b8e23">Fourth
Dalai Lama </font>refused to grant an audience to the Ü-Tsang king,
sparking a conflict when he began to attack Gelug monasteries. Chen
writes of the mysterious death of the Fourth Dalai Lama and the
Ü-Tsang King's plot to assassinate him because he was &quot;cursed&quot;
with illness, although Chen writes that the assassination was
probably the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, just two
years after the death of Yonten Gyatso, the Gelug and the Karma
Kargyu went to war, with the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular
Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler killed a large number of Gelugpa
lamas, occupied their monasteries in Drepung and Sera and banned all
attempts to find a new Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died
and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, complicating the
war effort, who accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new
Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to
maintain friendly relations with the new ruler of Ü-Tsang, Sonam
Rapten (1595-1657), the Dalai Lama's chief of Drepung and treasurer,
attempted to depose the Ü-Tsang king, leading to renewed conflict.
In 1633, the Gelugpa and several thousand Mongol supporters defeated
the Ü-Tsang King's forces near Lhasa before peaceful negotiations
could be reached. Goldstein writes that here 'the Mongols again
played a major role in Tibetan affairs, this time as the military arm
of the Dalai Lama'.</p>

the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso asked for help from the <font color="#dcdcdc">Mongol

at the time and headed the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat
Mongols. Güshi Khan accepted his role as <font color="#2f4f4f">protector,
</font>and between 1637 and 1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpa's
enemies in the <font color="#556b2f">Amdo </font>and Kham regions,
but also reestablished his entire tribe in Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged
Güshi Khan to attack the Ü-Tsang king's residence in Shigatse, to
which Güshi Khan agreed, enlisting Gelug monks and supporters to
help. After a year-long siege of Shigatse, Ü-Tsang's forces
surrendered in 1642. Güshi Khan then captured and executed the ruler
of Ü-Tsang, Tibetan King Karma Tenkyong.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Soon after Ü-Tsang's victory, <font color="#a9a9a9">Güshi
Khan </font>arranged a welcoming ceremony for <font color="#dcdcdc">Lozang
Gyatso, who </font>arrived a day's journey from Shigatse, and
presented the <font color="#2f4f4f">Tibetan conquest </font>as a gift
to <font color="#556b2f">the Dalai Lama</font>. In a second ceremony
in the main hall of Shigatse Fortress, Güshi Khan installed the
Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but handed over the actual
administration to <font color="#6b8e23">the Regent Sonam Chöpel.</font>
Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama 'supreme power', as
Goldstein writes, the title of King of Tibet was given to Güshi
Khan, who spent summers in the pastures north of Lhasa and occupied
Lhasa every winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan
retained control of the armed forces, but accepted his inferiority to
the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with
his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious
reign. However, Rawski notes that he eventually &quot;extended his
own power by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara by performing
rituals&quot;, building the Potala Palace and other structures on
traditional religious sites, and emphasising lineage reincarnation
through literary biographies. Goldstein notes that the Güshi Khan
and Dalai Lama's government persecuted the Karma Kagyu sect,
confiscated its wealth and property and even converted its
monasteries into Gelug monasteries. Rawski writes that this Mongol
patronage allowed the Gelugpas to dominate rival religious sects in
Tibet.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Meanwhile, China's Ming dynasty fell
to <font color="#a9a9a9">the rebellion of Li Zicheng </font>(1606-1645<font color="#a9a9a9">)
in </font>1644, but his short-lived Shun dynasty was crushed by a
Manchu invasion and the Han Chinese general Wu Sangui (1612-1678).
China Daily notes that when the next Qing dynasty replaced the Ming
dynasty, it only 'strengthened the Tibetan regime'. However, Kolmash
notes that the <font color="#dcdcdc">Dalai Lama </font>was very
attentive to events in China and in 1640 accepted an invitation from
the Manchus to send envoys to their capital Mukden in 1642, before
the collapse of the Ming Empire. Dawa Norbu, William Rockhill and
George N. Patterson write that when the later Qing dynasty emperor
<font color="#2f4f4f">Shunzhi </font>(reigned 1644-1661) invited the
fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso to Beijing in 1652, Shunzhi treated
the Dalai Lama as an independent ruler of Tibet. Patterson writes
that this was Shunzhi's attempt to secure an alliance with Tibet,
which would eventually lead to the establishment of a Mongol
manchukuo. In this meeting with the Qing emperor, Goldstein argues
that the Dalai Lama was not to be trifled with because he was allied
with the Mongol tribes, some of whom had declared themselves enemies
of the Qing. Van Praag states that the power of Tibet and the Dalai
Lama was recognised by 'the Emperor Manchu, the Mongol Khans and
princes, and the rulers of Ladakh, Nepal, India, Bhutan and Sikkim'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although the iPod was released in
2001, its price and Mac-only compatibility caused sales to be
relatively slow until 2004. The iPod range became Apple's &quot;digital
hub&quot; as the company began creating software for the growing
market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and
organisers had an established mainstream market, but the company
found that existing digital music players were &quot;big and clunky
or small and useless&quot; and their interfaces were &quot;incredibly
awful&quot;, so Apple decided to develop its own. At the behest of
CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's head of hardware design <font color="#2f4f4f">Jon
Rubinstein </font>assembled an engineering team to design the iPod
range, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey and
design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered
<font color="#556b2f">Toshiba's </font>disc drive when he met Apple's
supplier in Japan and bought the rights to it for Apple. He had also
already worked out how the screen, battery and other key components
would work. The aesthetic design was inspired by the <font color="#6b8e23">Braun
T3 transistor radio </font>designed by Dieter Rams in 1958, while the
wheel-based interface was inspired by Bang &amp; Olufsen's BeoCom
6000 telephone. The product (&quot;<font color="#a0522d">Walkman </font>of
the 21st century&quot; ) was developed in less than a year and
launched on 23 October 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible
product with a <font color="#228b22">5 gigabyte </font>hard drive
that put &quot;1 000 songs in your pocket&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Apple did not develop the iPod
software entirely in-house, but used the PortalPlayer reference
platform, based on two ARM cores. The platform contained rudimentary
software that ran on an embedded operating system with a commercial
microkernel. PortalPlayer had previously worked on an IBM-branded MP3

was replaced by Espy Sans. In later iPods, fonts were again changed
to Podium Sans, similar to Apple's corporate font Myriad. The
colour-screened iPods introduced some Mac OS X themes, such as Aqua
progress bars and brushed metal to resemble a combination lock. In

again with the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation
iPod Nano, changing the font <font color="#a0522d">to Helvetica </font>and

a void that corrupts parts of Hyrule, he transforms into a wolf.[h]
Eventually, he is able to change between his Hyrule and wolf form at

secondary items; instead, he attacks <font color="#a9a9a9">by biting
</font>and defends himself primarily by dodging attacks. However,
Wolf Link gains several important advantages in return - he moves
faster than <font color="#2f4f4f">a human </font>(although riding an
Epona is still faster), digs holes to create new passages and find
buried objects, and has better senses, such as the ability to follow
scent trails.[i] He also carries <font color="#556b2f">Midna</font>,
a <font color="#6b8e23">small imp-like creature that </font>gives him
clues, uses his energy field to attack enemies, helps him jump long
distances, and eventually allows Link to &quot;jump&quot; to any of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 2003, Nintendo announced that a
new The Legend of Zelda game was in the works for GameCube, made by
the same team that had created the cel-shaded The Wind Waker. At the<font color="#dcdcdc">
Game Developers Conference </font>the following year, director <font color="#2f4f4f">Eiji
Aonuma </font>inadvertently revealed that a sequel was in development
under the working title The Wind Waker 2, which would use a similar
graphical style to its predecessor. Nintendo of America told Aonuma
that sales of The Wind Waker <font color="#556b2f">in North America
</font>were slow because its cartoonish look gave the impression that
the game was designed for a young audience. Concerned that a sequel
would have the same problem, Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru
Miyamoto his desire to create a realistic Zelda game that would
appeal to the North American market. Miyamoto, who was hesitant to
change the game's look alone, suggested that the team focus instead
on gameplay innovation. He advised Aonuma to start by doing things
that couldn't be done in Ocarina of Time, particularly <font color="#6b8e23">horse

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Previous Zelda games have used the
theme of two separate but interconnected worlds. In A Link to the
Past, Link travels between the &quot;world of light&quot; and the
&quot;world of darkness&quot;; in Ocarina of Time and Oracle of Ages,
Link travels between two different eras. The Zelda team sought to
reuse this motif in the latest instalment of the series. It was
suggested that Link would turn into a wolf, just as he turns into <font color="#a9a9a9">a
rabbit </font>in A Link to the Past's Dark World.[m] The game's story
was created by Aonuma, and later scriptwriters <font color="#dcdcdc">Mitsuhiro
Takano </font>and Aya Kyogoku made several changes. Takano created
the script for the story scenes, while Kyogoku and Takayuki Ikkaku
handled the script for the actual game. Aonuma left his team to work
on the new idea while he directed <font color="#2f4f4f">The Minish
Cap </font>for Game Boy Advance. When he returned, he found the
Twilight Princess team struggling. The emphasis on parallel worlds
and the wolf variant had made Link's character implausible. Aonuma
also felt that the gameplay was not as innovative as in Phantom
Hourglass, which was developed with touch controls for the Nintendo
DS. At the same time, the Wii was being developed under the code name
&quot;<font color="#556b2f">Revolution&quot;</font>. <font color="#6b8e23">Miyamoto
felt that the </font>Revolution's pointing device, the Wii<font color="#a0522d">
Remote</font>, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and
suggested to Aonuma that he consider using it.</p>

odd to swing the Wii Remote with his right hand to control the sword

mirrored.[p] Details of the Wii controls began to emerge in December

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Nintendo staff members said that
demo users complained about the difficulty of <font color="#a9a9a9">the
controls</font>. Aonuma realised that his team had implemented the
Wii controls instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use.
He and Miyamoto began to rethink the controls, focusing on <font color="#dcdcdc">comfort
and ease of use</font>.[q] The camera movement was redesigned and the
object controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses.[r]
In addition, the new object system required the use of the button
previously used for <font color="#2f4f4f">the sword. </font>To
address this, sword control was moved back to gestures - something <font color="#556b2f">E3
attendees </font>had commented they wanted to see. This brought back
the problem of using <font color="#6b8e23">the right hand </font>swing
to control the left hand sword stroke. The team didn't have enough
time before launch to tweak Link's character model, so instead the
whole game was flipped the other way around - everything was done in
a mirror image. Link was now right-handed, and the references to
&quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; were swapped. However, the
GameCube version was left in the original orientation. The Twilight
Princess Player's Guide focuses on the Wii version, but has a section
in the back with mirror image maps for GameCube users[t].</p>

Kondo to consider using orchestral music in other songs in the game,

one of the main reasons for the decision. Both six- and seven-track

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Upon its release, Twilight Princess
was hailed as the best Zelda game of all time by many critics,
including writers from 1UP.com, Computer and Video Games, Electronic
Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GamesRadar, IGN and The Washington
Post. Game Informer called it &quot;so creative it rivals Hollywood's
best offerings&quot;. GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as &quot;a
game that deserves only the absolute highest recommendation&quot;.
Cubed3 praised Twilight Princess as &quot;the best single video game
experience&quot;. Twilight Princess' graphics were praised for their
art style and animation, even though the game was designed for the
GameCube, which is technically deficient compared to next-generation
consoles. Both <font color="#a9a9a9">IGN and GameSpy pointed out </font>the
blurred textures and low resolution of the characters. Despite these
complaints, Computer and Video Games considered the game's atmosphere
to be better than any previous Zelda game, and considered Twilight
Princess Hyrule to be the best version ever created. PALGN praised
the game's cinematics, stating that &quot;the cutscenes are the best
ever in a Zelda game&quot;. On the Wii version, GameSpot's <font color="#2f4f4f">Jeff

although 1UP.com said the sword remote-controlled attacks were &quot;the
most impressive in the entire series&quot;. <font color="#556b2f">Gaming

of this generation, although IGN criticised its MIDI tracks for
lacking the &quot;punch and sharpness&quot; of their orchestrated
counterparts. Hyper's <font color="#a0522d">Javier Glickman </font>praised
the game's &quot;very long missions, excellent Wii controls and the
ability to save at any time&quot;. However, he criticised it for
having no voice actors, no orchestral music and slightly outdated

organisation - originally SPECTRE, which stands for <font color="#dcdcdc">SPecial
Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion
- and </font>its characters had been at the heart of a long-running
legal dispute between <font color="#2f4f4f">Ian Fleming and Kevin

<font color="#556b2f">Thunderball. The </font>dispute began after
<font color="#6b8e23">Fleming </font>incorporated parts of an
unfinished film script written by McClory and screenwriter Jack
Whittingham, including characters and plot elements, into
Thunderball. McClory denied this in court, claiming that parts of the
novel were his property. In 1963, Fleming reached an out-of-court
settlement with McClory, giving <font color="#228b22">McClory </font>the
film rights. This made him producer of the 1965 film Thunderball -
produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman - and the 1983 film
<font color="#191970">Never Say Never Again</font>, a non-Eon film
that was an updated remake of Thunderball. In the 1990s, a second
remake called <font color="#8b0000">Warhead 2000 A.D. </font>was
planned for production and release, but was abandoned. Under the
terms of the 1963 contract, Fleming retained the literary rights, so
the Spectre organisation and associated characters were allowed to
continue to appear in print.</p>

RogerEbert.com, <font color="#dcdcdc">Matt Zoller Seitz </font>gave
the film four stars2<font color="#2f4f4f">.5 </font>out of four and
described Spectre as inconsistent and unable to fulfil its potential.
Kenneth Turan, who reviewed the film for the Los Angeles Times, said
Spectre &quot;seems exhausted and uninspired&quot;. Manohla Dargis of
The New York Times criticised the film for having &quot;nothing
surprising&quot; and for sacrificing originality for box office.
<font color="#556b2f">Scott Mendelson </font>of Forbes also harshly
criticised the film, calling Spectre &quot;the worst <font color="#6b8e23">007
movie in </font>30 years&quot;. Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich
called Spectre &quot;an overreaction to our current blockbuster
moment&quot;, which aims to &quot;be a serialised sequel&quot; and
&quot;prove itself a saga&quot;. He noted that &quot;nothing that
happens in Spectre stands up to even the slightest logical scrutiny&quot;,
but he did not come to &quot;bury Spectre, but to praise it in a
strange way&quot;. Because the film's final act is so bizarre, so
deliberately silly, that it deserves special attention.&quot; In a
positive review in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5
stars out of four and described, &quot;The 24th film about a British
MI6 agent with a license to kill is a Bond fan's time for
celebration, a wild, funny, superbly produced valentine to the
longest-running series of films.&quot; <font color="#a0522d">Mick
LaSalle </font>of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a perfect
100 points, stating, &quot;One of the great satisfactions of Spectre
is that for all the thrilling action and topical references to a
secret organization that is trying to steal everyone's personal
information, we get to believe in Bond as a human being.&quot;
Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News gave the film a rating of
80 and said: &quot;Craig is brutally effective. Dave Bautista makes a
good Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn't leave much
of an impression as the 'Bond girl' in this film, perhaps that's
because we've already met - all too briefly - the hypnotic Monica
Bellucci as the first real 'Bond woman' since Diana Rigg.&quot;
Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a rating of 75.
He said, &quot;This is the 24th Bond film, and it ranks solidly in
the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it's still a slick,
beautifully shot, action-packed, international thriller with several
wonderfully ridiculously entertaining set pieces, a touch of dry wit,
stormy gorgeous women and a classic psychopathic villain who is
clearly insane but seems to like it.&quot; Michael Phillips in the
Chicago Tribune gave the film a rating of 75. He said, &quot;For all
its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, 'Spectre'
works best when everyone is down on the ground, doing their jobs,
driving expensive fast cars casually, blasting the occasional cam,
enjoying themselves and their pretty clothes.&quot; Guy Lodge of
Variety gave the film 70 points, saying, &quot;<font color="#191970">Skyfall
</font>lacks the unexpected emotional urgency of <font color="#191970">Skyfall</font>,
as the film maintains the nostalgia of its predecessor with less
sentimentality.&quot;</p>

8 May, with a </font>range of 10 days before or after the quake. Mr
Geng acknowledged that the scientific community generally found
earthquake prediction problematic, but believed that &quot;the bigger
the earthquake, the easier it is to predict&quot;. Geng had long been
trying to establish a correlation between <font color="#6b8e23">droughts
</font>and earthquakes; Prime Minister Zhou Enlai was reportedly
interested in Geng's work. Geng's drought-earthquake correlation
theory was first published in <font color="#a0522d">1972 </font>and
was said to have successfully predicted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976
Tangshan earthquakes. The same article by Yazhou Zhoukan pointed out
the difficulties in predicting earthquakes. An official of the
Seismological Bureau replied that 'earthquake prediction is generally
recognised as scientifically difficult throughout the world'. The
official also denied that the Seismological Office had received any
<font color="#228b22">reports on earthquake prediction</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Japanese seismologist Yuji Yagi of
Tsukuba University said the earthquake occurred in <font color="#a9a9a9">two
stages</font>: &quot;The 155-mile-long <font color="#dcdcdc">Longmenshan
fault </font>ruptured in two parts, the first of which tore about
seven metres and the second four metres.&quot; His data also showed
that the earthquake lasted about two minutes and released <font color="#2f4f4f">30
times </font>more energy than the Great Hanshin Earthquake in Japan
in 1995, which killed more than <font color="#556b2f">6,000 people.
</font>He pointed out that <font color="#6b8e23">the shallowness of
the epicentre </font>and the density of the population greatly
increased the severity of the earthquake. Tokyo University
seismologist Teruyuki Kato said the seismic waves from the quake
travelled a long distance without losing their power because of the

not reached a consensus on what explains the dramatic drop in crime
in the city. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the
NYPD, such as the use of the CompStat system and the broken windows
theory. Others cite the end of the crack epidemic and demographic
changes such as immigration. According to another theory, widespread
exposure to lead pollution from car exhaust, which can lower
intelligence and increase aggression, caused the first crime wave in
the mid-20th century, and had the greatest impact on cities like New
York, where traffic was heavy. A strong correlation has been found
showing that violent crime rates in New York and other major cities
began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the
1970s. Another theory that explains the decline in New York's
homicide rate is that there is an inverse correlation between the
homicide rate and the city's increasingly humid climate.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the New York area, the New York
dialect is spoken, also known as <font color="#a9a9a9">Brooklynese </font>or
New Yorkese. It is generally considered one of the most recognisable
accents of American English. The classic version of this dialect
focuses on middle and working class people of European descent.
However, the arrival of non-European immigrants in recent decades has
led to changes in this distinctive dialect, and the traditional form
of this idiom is no longer as common among general New Yorkers as it
once was.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Question 0</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 129</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The traditional accent of the New
York region is described as non-rhotic, so the [ɹ] sound does not
appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant;
hence the pronunciation of the city name as &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">New
Yawk&quot;</font>. [ɹ] does not occur in words such as park [pɑək]
or [pɒək] (vowel with back vowel and diphthongized due to low chain
shift), butter [bʌɾə] or here [hiə]. In another feature, called
low back-chain shift, the [ɔ] vowel sound of words like talk, law,
cross, chocolate and coffee and the often homophonic [ɔr] in words
like core and more are stressed and usually raised more than in the
American vernacular. In the oldest and most extreme versions of the
New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like &quot;girl&quot; and
words like &quot;oil&quot; became diphthong [ɜɪ]. Speakers of other
accents often misinterpreted this as a reversal of the er and oy
sounds, with girl being pronounced &quot;goil&quot; and oil being
pronounced &quot;erl&quot;; this leads New Yorkers to caricaturize
such words as &quot;Joizey&quot; (Jersey), &quot;Toidy-Toid Street&quot;

He attended <font color="#556b2f">Huntingdon College in </font>Montgomery

</font>(1945-49). While a student, he wrote for the campus literary
magazines The Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer
Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both universities, he wrote
short stories and other works on racial injustice, a subject rarely
mentioned on campus at the time. In <font color="#a0522d">1950</font>,
Lee moved to New York, where he worked <font color="#228b22">as a
reservations clerk for </font>the British Overseas Airways
Corporation; there he began writing a collection of essays and short
stories about the people of Monroeville. In 1957, in the hope of
publication, Lee submitted his writings to a literary agent
recommended by Capote. A <font color="#191970">J. B. Lippincott
</font>editor who bought the manuscript advised him to quit the
airline and concentrate on his writing. Thanks to donations from

However, Hohoff felt that the manuscript was in no way fit for

was published on <font color="#dcdcdc">11 July 1960</font>. After
rejecting the &quot;Watchman&quot; title, it was initially renamed
Atticus, but Lee renamed it &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; to show
that the story was more than just a character study. Lippincott's
editorial staff warned Lee that he would probably sell only a few
thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled his hopes for the book,
saying. ...&quot;. I hoped for a quick and merciful death at the
hands of critics, but at the same time I sort of hoped that someone
would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement.

rather an example of how a writer &quot;should write about what he
knows, and write truthfully&quot;. Nevertheless, many of the people
and events of Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout.
Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was a lawyer like Atticus Finch, and
in <font color="#dcdcdc">1919</font>, he defended two black men
accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated,
he never again handled the criminal case. Lee's father was also
<font color="#2f4f4f">editor and publisher of </font>the Monroeville
newspaper. Although he was more pro-segregation than Atticus, he
gradually became more liberal in his later years. Although Scout's
mother died when he was an infant, Lee was when his <font color="#556b2f">25year-old
</font>mother Frances Cunningham Finch died. Lee's mother was prone
to a nervous illness that made her mentally and emotionally absent.
Lee had a brother named Edwin who, like the fictional Jem, was four
years older than his sister. As in the novel, a black housekeeper
came daily to tend to Lee's house and family.</p>

summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunt when his mother
visited New York. Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and
a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote were atypical
children: both loved to read. Lee was a rowdy bachelor, quick to pick
fights, but Capote was derided for his sophisticated vocabulary and
chatter. He and Capote invented and acted out stories, which they
wrote on <font color="#2f4f4f">an old Underwood typewriter </font>given

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Tom Robinson's origins are less
clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired
by several models. When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near
Monroeville accused a black man named <font color="#dcdcdc">Walter
Lett </font>of raping her. The story and the trial were reported in
her father's newspaper, which reported that Lett was sentenced to
death. After several letters appeared claiming that Lett had been
falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He
died there of tuberculosis in 1937. Investigators believe Robinson's
troubles reflect the infamous Scottsboro Boys case, in which nine
black men were convicted of raping two white women on trivial
evidence. In 2005, however, Lee said he had something less
sensational in mind, even though the Scottsboro case served &quot;the
same purpose&quot; <font color="#2f4f4f">of demonstrating Southern
prejudice. </font>Tom Robinson is also considered a role model for
<font color="#556b2f">Emmett Till</font>, a black teenager who was

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Researcher Jacqueline
Tavernier-Courbin writes of Lee's style and use of humour in the
tragic story: 'Laughter ... [reveals] the death beneath the beautiful
surface, but also by undercutting it; one can hardly ... control what
one can laugh at.' Scout's precocious observations of his neighbours
and their behaviour inspired David Kipen, director of the National
Endowment of the Arts, to call him &quot;hysterically funny&quot;.
However, in dealing with complex issues, Tavernier-Courbin notes that
Lee effectively uses <font color="#a9a9a9">parody, satire and irony
</font>from a child's perspective. When Dill promises to marry him
and then spends too much time with Jem, Scout decides that the best
way to get Dill to pay attention to him is to beat her up, which
Scout does several times. Scout's first day of school is a satirical
depiction of education; his teacher says he must repair the damage
Atticus has caused by teaching him to read and write, and forbids
Atticus from teaching him any more. Lee, however, deals with the most
unfunny situations with irony, as Jem and Scout try to understand how
Maycomb accepts racism while still sincerely trying to remain a
decent society. <font color="#dcdcdc">Satire and irony </font>are
used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one
interpretation of the book's title: Lee mocks education, the legal
system and his own society, using them as the objects of his humorous
indignation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">To Kill a Mockingbird has been
described by scholars as both a <font color="#a9a9a9">Southern </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Gothic
</font><font color="#a9a9a9">novel and a coming-of-age or
bildungsroman</font>. The grotesque and almost supernatural nature of
Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice
associated with Tom Robinson, add to the novel's Gothic aura. Lee
used the term &quot;Gothic&quot; to describe the architecture of the
Maycomb courthouse and Dill's exaggerated morbid Boo Radley's
performances. Outsiders are also an important element in Southern
Gothic texts, and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy of
the city lead scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite his questioning of the town's
systems, Scout respects <font color="#2f4f4f">Atticus </font>as an
authority above all others, believing that following one's conscience
is the most important thing, even if it results in social ostracism.
However, scholars dispute the classification of Southern Gothic,
stating that Boo Radley is in fact humane, protective and benevolent.
Lee also dealt with issues such as alcoholism, incest, rape and
racial violence and wrote about his small town in a realistic rather
than melodramatic way. He portrays the problems of the individual
characters as universal problems that underlie every society.</p>

reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird to be a novel that dealt
primarily with <font color="#a9a9a9">race relations. </font>Claudia
Durst Johnson considers it &quot;reasonable to believe&quot; that the
novel was shaped by two events related to race issues in Alabama: the
refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a city bus to a white
person, which triggered the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955, and the
1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and
Polly Myers were admitted to the university (Myers eventually
withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but was readmitted in
1980). Writing about the historical context of the novel's
construction, two other literary scholars note: &quot;To Kill a
Mockingbird was written and published in the midst of the most
significant and controversial social change in the South since the
Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably set in the mid-1930s, the
story, told from the perspective of the 1950s, expresses the
contradictions, tensions and fears of this change.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Researcher Patrick Chura, who says
that Emmett Till was a role model for Tom Robinson, lists the
injustices experienced by the fictional Tom, which Till also faced.
Chura argues that the icon of the black rapist damages the
representation of &quot;mythologised vulnerable and sacred southern
womanhood&quot;. All offences committed by black men at the time of
the novel, which only referred to sexual intercourse with <font color="#a9a9a9">white
women</font>, often resulted in <font color="#dcdcdc">the death
penalty for the </font>accused. The jury in Tom Robinson's trial were
<font color="#2f4f4f">poor white farmers who </font>convicted him
despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as the more educated
and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's verdict. In
addition, the victim of the racially motivated To Kill a Mockingbird
was physically disabled, rendering him unable to commit the act of
which he was accused, but crippling him in other ways as well. Roslyn
Siegel cites Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif of
white Southern writers that the black man is &quot;stupid, pathetic,
defenceless and dependent on the fair treatment of whites rather than
his own intelligence to save him&quot;. Although Tom is spared
lynching, he is killed by excessive violence during an escape attempt
from prison and is <font color="#556b2f">shot </font><font color="#6b8e23">seventeen

racism of the town </font>without the help of the other white
residents. He is also alone when he faces a group intent on lynching

even uses dreamlike images of the mad dog incident to illustrate some
of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes: &quot;Maycomb's real mad dog
is the racism that denies Tom Robinson's humanity.&quot; .... When

Atticus. Atticus, however, is the moral centre of the novel, and he
teaches Jem one of the most important lessons of courage. In a
statement that foreshadows Atticus's motive to defend Tom Robinson
and depicts Mrs. Dubose's determination to break free from her
morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is &quot;when you
are licked before you start, but you start anyway and see it through
no matter what.&quot;</p>

Shields, </font>author of the only biography of Harper Lee to date,
argues that the novel's enduring popularity and impact is due to the
fact that &quot;its lessons <font color="#dcdcdc">about human dignity
and respect for others </font>remain fundamental and universal&quot;.
Atticus' teaching to Scout that &quot;you never really understand a
person until you look at things from his point of view - until you
climb into his skin and walk in it&quot; is an example of his
compassion. He reflects on this comment while listening to <font color="#2f4f4f">Mayella
</font>Ewell's testimony. When Mayella reacts with confusion to
Atticus' question about whether she has friends, Scout suggests that
she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. After escorting Boo home after
he saves their lives, Scout stands on Radley's porch and reflects on
the events of the past three years from Boo's perspective. As one
writer notes, &quot;... [w]hile the novel is about tragedy and
injustice, heartbreak and loss, it also carries with it a strong
sense of courage, compassion and awareness of history, so that we can
be better people.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Just as Lee explores Jem's
development in a racist and unjust society, Scout realises what it
means to be a woman, and several female characters influence her
development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older
brother allows her to portray the diversity and depth of the novel's
female characters, both as one of them and as outsiders. Scout's
primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbour Miss Maudie,
both strong-willed, independent and protective. Mayella Ewell is also
influential; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man to cover up
her desire for him. The female characters who comment most on Scout's
reluctance to follow a more feminine role are also those who
contribute most to racist and classist perspectives. For example,
<font color="#a9a9a9">Mrs. Dubose </font>chides Scout for not wearing
a dress and blouse, pointing out that she is ruining the family name
by not dressing like one, and she also insults Atticus' intentions to
defend Tom Robinson. Balancing the masculine influences of Atticus
and Jem with the feminine influences of <font color="#dcdcdc">Calpurnia
and Miss Maudie, </font>one scholar writes: &quot;Lee gradually shows
that Scout is becoming a Southern <font color="#2f4f4f">feminist</font>,
for she demonstrates through first-person narration that Scout/Jean
Louise still retains the ambivalence about being a Southern woman
that she had as a child.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Absent mothers and abusive fathers
are another theme of the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before
Scout remembered her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs Radley is
silent about the closure of Bo's house. With the exception of
<font color="#a9a9a9">Atticus, the </font>fathers depicted are
abusers. <font color="#dcdcdc">Bob Ewell</font>, it is implied,
molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house
until Boo is remembered only as a ghost. Bob Ewell and Mr Radley
represent a kind of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel
suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine
hypocrites of the missionary society, can mislead society. Atticus
stands out as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains,
&quot;The task of correcting society lies with real men who embody
traditional masculine qualities such as heroic individualism,
courage, and an unswerving knowledge of and devotion to social
justice and morality.&quot;</p>

to the legal issues raised by the references in To Kill a
Mockingbird, particularly in the scenes outside the courtroom.
Claudia Durst Johnson writes that &quot;two legal scholars have
collected more critical readings in law journals than all the
literary scholars have collected in literary journals&quot;. The
opening quote from the 19th century essayist Charles Lamb reads,
&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Lawyers </font>were once children, I
suppose.&quot; Johnson points out that in Scout and Jem's childhood
world, too, compromises and agreements are made by spitting on each
other's palms and laws are debated between Atticus and his children:
is it right for Bob Ewell to hunt and trap in the off-season? Many
social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr <font color="#dcdcdc">Dolphus
Raymond </font>is banished by society for taking a black woman as his
wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is spanked by her
father as punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; Boo Radley, for
turning non-human, receives a punishment far greater than any court
could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks rules and laws and
reacts to his punishment for them. For example, he refuses to wear
<font color="#2f4f4f">frilly clothes </font>and says that Aunt
Alexandra's &quot;fanatical&quot; attempts to dress him in them made
him feel as if &quot;a pink cotton-clad prison was closing in on
[him]&quot;. Johnson notes that &quot;[t]his novel is an exploration
of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes
and how the interpersonal configurations dictated or triggered by
those codes fail or contribute to the inhabitants of [their] small
worlds&quot;.</p>

their symbolism appear throughout the novel. The family surname <font color="#dcdcdc">Finch
</font>also shares Lee's mother's maiden name. <font color="#2f4f4f">The
titular bird </font>is a central motif in this theme, first appearing
when Atticus, who has given his children air rifles for Christmas,
has Uncle Jack teach them to shoot. Atticus warns them that although
they can &quot;shoot as many bluebirds as they like&quot;, they must
remember that &quot;killing a mockingbird is a sin&quot;. Confused,
Scout turns to his neighbour Miss Maudie, who explains that
mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that
mockingbirds only bring joy with their song, and says: &quot;They do
nothing but sing their hearts out to us&quot;. Writer Edwin Bruell
summed up the symbolism when he wrote in 1964: &quot;'To kill a
mockingbird' is to kill <font color="#556b2f">that which is innocent
and harmless like </font>Tom Robinson.&quot; Scholars have noted that
Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme in an attempt to make a

influences that To Kill a Mockingbird has had is Atticus Finch's
model of <font color="#a9a9a9">integrity </font>in the legal
profession. As researcher Alice Petry explains, &quot;Atticus has
become something of a folk hero in legal circles, and is treated
almost as if he were a real person&quot;. Morris Dees of the Southern
Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became <font color="#dcdcdc">a
lawyer, </font>and Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided
over the trial of Timothy McVeigh, considers Atticus a major legal
influence. A law professor at the University of Notre Dame said that
To Kill a Mockingbird was the most influential textbook he taught
from, and an article in the Michigan Law Review argues that 'no
real-life lawyer has had a greater impact on the self-esteem or
public perception of the legal profession', and then wonders whether
'Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or a particularly cunning
mercenary'.</p>

racism and sexism and should not be honored. The editorial provoked a
backlash from lawyers who entered the profession because of Atticus
and considered him a hero. Atticus' critics claimed that he is
morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge
Maycomb's racist status quo. However, in <font color="#a9a9a9">1997</font>,

descriptions of rape. After hearing that the school administration
was holding hearings to decide on the book's suitability for the

suggesting that it be used &quot;to enroll the Hanover County School
Board in any first grade class of their choice.&quot; In 1968, the

contributed to the success of the <font color="#a9a9a9">civil rights
movement </font>in the 1960s, as it &quot;arrived at the right moment
to help the South and the nation deal with the racial tensions caused
by the accelerating civil rights movement&quot;. Its publication is
so closely associated with the civil rights movement that many
studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include
descriptions of key moments in the movement, even though he was not
directly involved in any of them. Civil rights leader Andrew Young
commented that part of the book's effectiveness is that it &quot;inspires
hope in the midst of chaos and confusion&quot; and uses racial
epithets to illustrate the reality of the era in which it is set.
Young considers the novel to be an &quot;act of humanity&quot;
because it shows that people can rise above their prejudices. Alabama
author Mark Childress compares it to the influence of <font color="#dcdcdc">Uncle
Tom's Cabin</font>, which is widely credited with helping to spark
the American Civil War. Childress notes that the novel &quot;gives
white Southerners a way to understand the racism they have been
raised with and find another way. And most white people in the South
were good people. Most white people in the South did not throw bombs
and cause destruction ... I think the book really helped them
understand what was wrong with the system in a way that no treatise
ever could, because it was popular fiction, because it was told from
a child's point of view.&quot;

celebrities. From then on, he refused to talk to journalists about
the book. He also flatly refused introductions, writing in 1995:
&quot;Introductions inhibit pleasure, kill the joy of anticipation

that in some cases they delay the coming dose. Mockingbird still says

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">An earlier draft of To Kill a
Mockingbird, called <font color="#a9a9a9">Go Set a Watchman</font>,
was controversially released on <font color="#dcdcdc">14 July 2015</font>.
This draft, which was completed in 1957 , is set 20 years after the
time period described in To Kill a Mockingbird, but it is not a
continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story
follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit his
father Atticus Finch in Maycomb, Alabama, where he is confronted with
intolerance in his community. The manuscript of Watchman was believed
lost until Lee's lawyer <font color="#6b8e23">Tonja Carter </font>found
it, but the claim has been widely disputed. Watchman features early
versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird.
According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally
intended to be the first book in a trilogy: &quot;They discussed
publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, with a shorter tie-in
novel in between.&quot; However, rare book expert James S. Jaffe has
refuted this claim, as he examined the pages at the request of Lee's
lawyer and found them to be only a second draft of To Kill a
Mockingbird. The claim was also contradicted by Jonathan Mahler's
description of how &quot;Watchman&quot; was only seen as a first
draft of &quot;Mockingbird&quot;. The instances where many passages
overlap between the two books, in some cases word for word, also
refute this claim.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Critics and reviewers have drawn
attention to Lee's strongest stylistic feature, which is his
<font color="#a9a9a9">narrative </font>talent, described in an early
Time magazine review as &quot;palpable brilliance&quot;. Ten years
later, another reviewer said: 'Harper Lee has a remarkable gift for
storytelling. His art is visual, and with cinematic fluidity and
subtlety we see how one scene blends into another without a jolt of
transition.&quot; Lee combines the voice of a child narrator
observing her surroundings with that of an adult woman reflecting on
her childhood, and uses the ambiguity of this voice, combined with
the narrative technique of <font color="#dcdcdc">flashbacks, </font>to
play with perspectives in an artful way. This narrative technique
allows Lee to tell a &quot;delightfully deceptive&quot; story,
blending the simplicity of childhood observation with adult
situations complicated by hidden motives and unquestioned traditions.
At times, however, this intermingling leads critics to question the
depth of Scout's supernatural vocabulary and insight. Both Harding
LeMay and novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks questioned
whether sheltered children like Scout and Jem could understand the
complexities and horrors of the trial of Tom Robinson's life.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Harper Lee has famously stayed away
from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. He did, however,
provide some insight into his themes when, in a rare letter to the
editor, he wrote in response to the heated reactions his book had
provoked: 'It is surely obvious to the simplest intellect that To
Kill a Mockingbird rarely expresses in more than two syllables the
code of honour and conduct of the Christian ethic which is the
heritage of <font color="#a9a9a9">all Southerners.</font>'</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Question 0</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to Lee, his book simply
expressed a Christian code of honour and behaviour, inherited from
whom?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 52</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When the book was published, critics
pointed out that it was divided into two parts, and opinions on Lee's
ability to combine them were mixed. The first part of the novel deals
with the children's infatuation with Boo Radley and their feelings of
safety and comfort in <font color="#a9a9a9">the neighbourhood.</font>
Critics were generally impressed by Scout and Jem's observations of
their strange neighbours. One reviewer was so impressed by Lee's
detailed accounts of the Maycomb residents that he classified the
book as <font color="#dcdcdc">Southern Romantic regionalism.</font>
This sentimentality is reflected in the way Lee presents the Southern
caste system as an explanation for the behaviour of almost every
character in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra relates the faults and
advantages of the Maycomb residents to genealogy (families with
gambling and drinking faults), and the narrator sets the action and
characters amid the finely detailed background of the Finch family
and Maycomb history. This regionalist theme is also evident in
Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances towards
Tom Robinson and in Scout's definition of '<font color="#2f4f4f">fine
people</font>' as sensible people who make the best of what they
have. The <font color="#556b2f">South itself</font>, with its
traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the
characters.</p>

</font>is the main example of several innocents who are carelessly or
deliberately destroyed throughout the novel. However, scholar
Christopher Metress links the mockingbird <font color="#dcdcdc">to
Boo Radley</font>: &quot;Rather than wanting to exploit Boo for his
own amusement (as he does at the beginning of the novel by presenting
a gothic play about his history), Scout begins to see him as a
'mockingbird' - that is, a man with an inner goodness that needs to
be nurtured.&quot; The final pages of the book illustrate this, when
Scout explains the moral of the story Atticus read to him, noting
with reference to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson the misunderstood
character: 'when they finally saw him, why he had done none of those
things ...'. Atticus, he was <font color="#2f4f4f">really nice</font>&quot;,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The novel reveals the loss of
innocence so often that critic R. A. Dave argues that because each
character faces or even suffers defeat, the book takes on the
characteristics of a <font color="#a9a9a9">classic tragedy</font>. By
examining how each character deals with his or her personal loss, Lee
builds a framework for judging whether the characters are heroes or
fools. He guides the reader through such an assessment, alternating
between unabashed admiration and biting irony. Scout's experience of
the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock
him, gossip and &quot;project a smug, colonialist attitude towards
other races&quot; while giving a &quot;gentlemanly, pious and
moralistic impression&quot;. Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's
case, he is the last to leave the courtroom, except for his children
and the black spectators seated on the colored balcony, who rise
quietly as Atticus walks below them to honor his efforts.</p>

mixed. The New Yorker declared it &quot;deft, modest and utterly
brilliant&quot;, and a reviewer for The Atlantic Monthly found it &quot;a
pleasant, unpretentious read&quot;, but found the voice of the
narrator - &quot;a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a
well-educated adult&quot; - implausible. A 1960 Time magazine review
of the book said it &quot;teaches the reader a surprising number of
useful truths about little girls and Southern life&quot;, and called
Scout Finch &quot;the most charming child since Carson McCullers'
Frankie's Wedding&quot;. <font color="#a9a9a9">The Chicago Sunday

publication was celebrated and its impact reflected upon. Eric Zorn

but writes that the key lesson is that &quot;courage is not always
flashy, not always enough, but it is always elegant&quot;. The Sydney
Morning Herald's Jane Sullivan agrees, noting that the book &quot;still
evokes fresh and horrified indignation&quot; because it examines a
morality that has recently become unfashionable. Chimamanda Ngozi
Adichie, writing in The Guardian, says that Lee, rare among American
novelists, writes &quot;with a fiercely progressive ink in which
racism is inescapable and its basis questionable&quot;, and compares
him <font color="#a9a9a9">to William Faulkner, </font>who wrote about
racism as inescapable. In the Scottish newspaper The Herald, the

epigrams&quot; and the novel &quot;a sugar-coated myth&quot; about
Alabama history. Barra writes: &quot;It is time to stop pretending
that To Kill a Mockingbird is some sort of timeless classic that
ranks among the great works of American literature. Its bloodless
liberal humanism is sadly out of date&quot;. In The New Yorker,
Thomas Mallon criticises Atticus's rigid and self-indulgent
behaviour, calling Scout &quot;a kind of well-constructed puppet&quot;
whose words and actions are implausible. While Mallon acknowledges
that the novel works, he chides Lee's &quot;wildly unstable&quot;
narrative tone for developing a story about a domestic neighborhood
until it begins to convey morality in a courtroom drama, and goes on
to state that &quot;the book has begun to cherish its own goodness&quot;
by the time the case is over.&quot; In defence of the book, <font color="#dcdcdc">Akin
Ajayi </font>writes that justice &quot;is often complex, but it must
always be based on the idea of equality and justice for all&quot;.
Ajayi says the book forces readers to question issues of race, class
and society, but it is not written to solve them.</p>

injustice, its black characters are not fully explored. The book uses
racial epithets, depicts stereotypically superstitious blacks and
<font color="#a9a9a9">Calpurnia, which </font>some critics see as an
updated version of the 'contented slave' motif and others see as
simply unexplored, which is why the book is seen as marginalising
black characters. One writer argues that Scout's use of narrative
serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and
detach themselves from racial conflict. Scout's voice &quot;serves as
a non-self through which the rest of us - black and white, male and
female - can find our relative positions in society&quot;. A teaching
guide for the novel, published by The English Journal, warns that
&quot;what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may
seem demeaning to another&quot;. According to a Canadian language
skills consultant, the novel was well suited to white students, but
<font color="#dcdcdc">black students </font>found it &quot;demoralising&quot;.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Diane McWhorter, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian of the Birmingham Civil Rights Campaign,
argues that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism and not racists,
noting that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive
dissonance as they confront the <font color="#a9a9a9">harsh reality
of inequality</font>. This feeling causes them to question the
beliefs they have been brought up to believe, and for many children,
the novel does just that. McWhorter writes of Lee: &quot;For a
Southern white person to write such a book in the late 1950s is truly
unusual, for its very existence is an <font color="#dcdcdc">act of
protest.&quot; </font>Writer James McBride calls Lee brilliant, but
does not call him brave: &quot;I think that by calling Harper Lee
brave you free yourself from your own racism ...&quot;. He certainly
set the standards for how these issues should be discussed, but in
many ways I feel that ... the moral bar has been lowered. And that's
really worrying. We need thousands of Atticus Finches.&quot; However,
McBride defends the book's sentimentality and the way Lee approaches

Harper Lee herself refused to attend the screenings because &quot;she
abhors anything based on the book's reputation&quot;. To underscore
this sentiment, Lee insisted that the recipe book Calpurnia's

Heritage Museum. David Lister in The Independent says that Lee's
refusal to talk to journalists made them want to interview him all
the more, and his silence 'makes Bob Dylan look like a slut to the

Monroeville a destination, hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the

Boys, he developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar
energy into collector boxes, which increased the heating capacity to
the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West showed an early taste for the
arts; he started <font color="#a9a9a9">writing </font><font color="#dcdcdc">poetry
</font>at the age of five. His mother recalled that she first noticed
West's passion for drawing and music when he was in the third grade.
Growing up in the city, West was heavily involved in its hip-hop
scene. He started rapping in third grade and began writing musical
compositions in seventh grade, eventually selling them to other
artists. At the age of thirteen, West wrote a rap song called <font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;</font><font color="#556b2f">Green
Eggs and Ham</font><font color="#2f4f4f">&quot; </font>and began
persuading his mother to pay him $25 an hour for time in the
recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio with a
microphone hanging from the ceiling on a wire hanger. Although this
was not what West's mother wanted, she supported him. West ran into
producer/DJ <font color="#a0522d">No I.D. </font>, with whom he
quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor,
and it was from him that West learned to sample and program beats
after receiving his first sampler at the age of 15.</p>

American Academy of Art in </font><font color="#a9a9a9">Chicago </font>in
1997 and began painting classes, but soon afterwards he transferred
to the University of Chicago to study <font color="#2f4f4f">English</font>.
He soon found that his busy schedule was interfering with his musical
work, and he20 dropped out of college to pursue his musical dreams.
This action greatly angered his mother, who was also a professor at
the university. She later commented: &quot;It was drummed into my
head that college was the ticket to the good life.... But some career
goals don't require college. When Kanye made an album called <font color="#6b8e23">College

you are, rather than following the path that society had laid out for
you.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Kanye West began his early
production career <font color="#a9a9a9">in the mid-1990s </font>by
making beats mainly for up-and-coming <font color="#dcdcdc">local
artists</font>, eventually developing a style that involved speeding
up the vocal samples of <font color="#2f4f4f">classic soul records</font>.
His first official production credits came at the age of 19, when he
produced eight tracks for Down to Earth, the debut album of a Chicago
rapper named Grav, released in 1996. For a time, West worked as a
ghost producer for <font color="#556b2f">Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot;
Angeletti. </font>Due to his collaboration with D-Dot, West was
unable to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and
producer of <font color="#6b8e23">Go-Getters</font>, a late 1990s
Chicago rap group consisting of himself, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe and
Arrowstar. His group was managed by John &quot;Monopoly&quot;
Johnson, Don Crowley and Happy Lewis of <font color="#a0522d">Hustle
Period, a </font>management company. After participating in several
promotional shoots and making a few radio appearances, The Go-Getters
released their first and only studio album World Record Holders in
<font color="#228b22">1999</font>. The album featured other Chicago
rappers such as Rhymefest, Mikkey Halsted, Miss Criss and Shayla G.
At the same time, West, Arrowstar, Boogz and Brian &quot;All Day&quot;
Miller were producing.</p>

producing records for a number of well-known artists and music
groups. The third track on <font color="#a9a9a9">Foxy </font>Brown's
second studio album Chyna Doll was produced by West. Her sophomore
album went on to become the first hip-hop album by a female rapper to
debut at the top of the US Billboard 200 in its first week of
release. West produced three of the tracks on Harlem World's first
and only album, The Movement, along with Jermaine Dupri and
production duo Trackmasters. His tracks featured rapper Nas, Drag-On
and R&amp;B singer Carl Thomas. The ninth track from World Party, the
last Goodie Mob album featuring the four founding members of the rap
group before their break-up, was produced by West with his manager
Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angeletti. In the late millennium, West ended
up producing six songs for the<font color="#dcdcdc"> Tell 'Em Why U
Madd </font>album, which D-Dot released under the moniker The Madd
Rapper, a fictional character he created for the sketches on Life
After Death, the second and final studio album by The Notorious

</font>when he started producing for artists on <font color="#dcdcdc">Roc-A-Fella
Records</font>. West went on to gain recognition, and is often
credited with reviving Jay-Z's career with his contribution to the
rap mogul's influential 2001 album <font color="#2f4f4f">The
Blueprint.</font> The Blueprint has consistently been ranked among
the best hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of
the album sparked considerable interest in West as a producer. West
worked as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records and produced
albums for other artists on the label, including Beanie Sigel,
Freeway and Cam'ron. He also produced hit songs for Ludacris, Alicia
Keys and Janet Jackson.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although West was successful as a
producer, his real ambition was to be <font color="#a9a9a9">a rapper</font>.
Although he had developed his rapping skills long before he started
producing, West often found it challenging to be accepted as a rapper
and struggled to get a record deal. He was ignored by several record
companies because he did not portray the <font color="#dcdcdc">gangsta
image </font>that was prevalent in mainstream hip hop at the time.
After meetings with <font color="#2f4f4f">Capitol Records, </font>West
was eventually denied an artist contract.</p>

convinced the Capitol executive not to do so. Desperate to prevent
West from defecting to another label, then label president Damon Dash
reluctantly signed West to <font color="#dcdcdc">Roc-A-Fella </font>Records.
Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to
support West as a rapper because many saw him primarily <font color="#2f4f4f">as
a producer </font>and because his background was at odds with that of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West's breakthrough came a year
later on <font color="#a9a9a9">23 October 2002, </font>when he fell
asleep at the wheel and was involved in a near-fatal car accident
while driving home from a recording studio in California after
working late. In the crash, he fractured his jaw, which had to be
reattached with a wire during reconstructive surgery. The accident
inspired West; two weeks after his hospitalisation, he recorded a
song at Record Plant with his jaw still attached. The composition,
<font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;</font><font color="#2f4f4f">Through The
Wire</font><font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;</font>, expressed West's
experience after the accident, and helped lay the groundwork for his
debut album, as West says &quot;all the better artists have expressed
what they've been through&quot;. West added that &quot;the album was
my medicine&quot;, as working on the album took him out of the pain.
&quot;Through The Wire&quot; was first available on West's <font color="#556b2f">Get
Well Soon </font><font color="#6b8e23">... </font>mixtape, released
in December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was
working on an album called<font color="#a0522d"> The College Dropout</font>,
the overall theme of which was &quot;make your own decisions. Don't
let society tell you: 'This is what you have to do'&quot;.</p>

full of old records and demos to and from the studio, West completed
much of the production of his debut album in less than 15 minutes. He
recorded the rest of the album <font color="#a9a9a9">in Los Angeles
</font>while recovering from a car accident. By the time he had
finished the album, <font color="#dcdcdc">it leaked </font>months
before its release date. However, West decided to take the
opportunity to revise the album, and The College Dropout was remixed,
remastered and substantially revised before release. As a result,
certain tracks originally intended for the album were later
cancelled, including &quot;Keep the Receipt&quot; with Ol' Dirty
Bastard and &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; with
Consequence. West meticulously refined the production, adding string
arrangements, gospel choirs, improved drum programming, and new
verses. West's perfectionism led to the release of The College

chart for five weeks. <font color="#556b2f">&quot;Slow Jamz&quot;</font>,
his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even
bigger success: it became the first number one hit for the three
musicians. The College Dropout received near universal critical
acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted best album of the
year by two major music publications, and is consistently ranked
among the artists' major hip-hop works and debut albums. &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Jesus
Walks</font>&quot;, the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West
to a wider audience; the song is about faith and Christianity.
However, the song made it into the top 20 of Billboard's pop charts,
even though industry executives predicted that a song with such
blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio stations.
The College Dropout eventually went triple platinum in the US and
earned West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and
Best Rap Album (which it won). During this time, West also founded
<font color="#a0522d">GOOD Music</font>, a record label and
management company that would go on to house collaborating artists
and producers such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focus
of West's production style was the use of accelerated vocal samples
on soul records. Partly due to the popularity of The College Dropout,
however, this kind of sampling had been much copied by others;
because of this overuse, and also because West felt he had become too
dependent on technology, he decided to find a new sound.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Starting his second album that
autumn, West invested two million dollars and spent more than a year
making his second album. West drew significant inspiration from
Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop band
<font color="#a9a9a9">Portishead</font>, produced with the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had
inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop
production. Although West could not afford many live instruments at
the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success
enabled him to hire <font color="#dcdcdc">a string orchestra </font>for
his second album<font color="#2f4f4f"> Late Registration</font>. West
collaborated with American film music composer <font color="#556b2f">Jon
Brion</font>, who served as co-producer on several tracks for the
album. Although Brion had no previous experience in making hip-hop
albums, he and West found that they could work together productively
after their first afternoon in the studio, where they realised that
neither of them limited their musical knowledge and vision to one
particular genre. Late Registration sold over <font color="#6b8e23">2.3
million </font>copies in the US alone by the end of 2005, and was
hailed by industry observers as the only successful major album
release of the autumn season, which had been plagued by a steady
decline in CD sales.</p>

a year earlier when he stormed out of the American Music Awards in
2004 after losing <font color="#a9a9a9">Best New Artist</font>, the
rapper's first large-scale controversy came just days after the
release of Late Registration during a benefit concert for victims of
<font color="#dcdcdc">Hurricane Katrina. </font>In September 2005,
NBC broadcast <font color="#2f4f4f">A Concert for Hurricane Relief,
in which </font>West was one of the speakers. When West appeared
alongside actor <font color="#556b2f">Mike Myers</font>, he deviated

script. When it was West's turn to speak again, he said: &quot;George
Bush doesn't care about black people&quot;. West's comment reached a
large section of the United States, leading to mixed reactions;

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West had just spent the previous
year touring the world with <font color="#a9a9a9">U2 </font>on their
Vertigo tour, and he felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that
could work more effectively <font color="#dcdcdc">in large arenas</font>.
To this end, West incorporated a synthesizer into his hip-hop
production, used slower beats and experimented with electronic music
influenced by <font color="#2f4f4f">1980s </font>music. In addition
to U2, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as
<font color="#556b2f">The Rolling Stones </font>and Led Zeppelin for
melody and chord progression. To create a more introspective and
personal lyric for his next output, the third in a planned tetralogy
of educational studio albums, West listened to folk and country
singers <font color="#6b8e23">Bob Dylan </font><font color="#a0522d">and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West's third studio album <font color="#a9a9a9">Graduation
</font>garnered a lot of publicity when, on the day of its release,
West faced a sales battle with rapper <font color="#dcdcdc">50 </font>Cent's
Curtis. Following its release in September 2007, Graduation outsold
Curtis, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and
selling 957<font color="#2f4f4f">,000</font> copies in its first
week. Graduation once again continued West's string of critical and
commercial successes, with the album's lead single &quot;Stronger&quot;
bringing the rapper his third chart-topping hit. 'Stronger', which
features samples from French house duo <font color="#556b2f">Daft
Punk</font>, not only encouraged other hip-hop artists to incorporate
house and electronic elements into their music, but has also been
credited with contributing to the resurgence of disco and
electro-influenced music in the late 2000s. XXL's Ben Detrick cited
the outcome of the sales battle between 50 Cent's Curtis and West's
Graduation as responsible for changing the direction of hip-hop and
paving the way for new rappers who did not follow the fashion of
hardcore gangsters, writing: &quot;If ever there was a watershed
moment that showed the changing direction of hip-hop, it may have
come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album
would have the overwhelming sales figures.&quot;</p>

cosmetic surgery involving a tummy tuck and breast reduction in
November 2007.Months later, West and fiancée <font color="#dcdcdc">Alexis

who soon afterwards embarked <font color="#2f4f4f">on the </font>2008

mixed than his previous output. Despite this, the album's singles

follow-up single &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Heartless</font>&quot;
performed similarly and became her second consecutive &quot;Hot Shot

Although 808s &amp; Heartbreak was criticised before its release, it
had a significant impact on hip hop music, encouraging other rappers

only intermittently. Complex magazine writer Noah Callahan-Bever was
there during the sessions and described the &quot;communal&quot;

he can win any argument, and we're here to contribute, challenge and

Dark Twisted Fantasy</font>, West's fifth studio album, was released
<font color="#dcdcdc">in November 2010 </font>to critical acclaim,
with many describing it as his best work, confirming his return.
Unlike his previous output, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark
Fantasy follows a maximalist philosophy and explores themes of
celebrity and excess. The album included the international hit <font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;All
of the Lights&quot; </font>and the Billboard hits &quot;Power&quot;,
&quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot;, the latter of which
accompanied the 35-minute film of the same name. During this period,
West launched a free music programme <font color="#556b2f">GOOD
Fridays on </font>his website, which offered free downloads of
previously unreleased songs every Friday, some of which were included
on the album. This campaign ran from 20 August to 17 December 2010.
Dark Fantasy went platinum in the US, but its omission as an <font color="#6b8e23">album
of the year </font>nominee was not a surprise to 54. At the Grammy

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After initially announcing a new
album entitled <font color="#a9a9a9">So Help Me God </font>scheduled
for a 2014 release, in March 2015 West announced that the album would
instead be tentatively titled <font color="#dcdcdc">SWISH</font>.
Later that month, West received an honorary doctorate <font color="#2f4f4f">from
the School of the </font><font color="#556b2f">Art Institute of
Chicago </font>for his contributions to music, fashion and popular
culture, officially making him an honorary doctor. The following
month, West headlined the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, although
nearly a million people signed a petition to have him perform at <font color="#6b8e23">the
135,</font>000-strong festival. At one point, he told the audience,
&quot;You are now watching the greatest living rock star in the
world&quot;. The media, including social media sites such as Twitter,
reacted strongly to his appearance. NME noted, &quot;The decision to
book West for the venue has proved controversial since its
announcement, and the show itself seemed to polarise both Glastonbury
visitors and those who tuned in to watch it on TV.&quot; The
publication added that &quot;she lets her music speak for itself and
prove itself&quot;. The Guardian said that &quot;his set has an
intense ferocity - but there are gaps and stuttering, and he is
strangely lonely in front of a large audience&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In December 2015, West released a
song called <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;Facts&quot;</font>. He
announced in January 2016 on Twitter that SWISH would be released <font color="#dcdcdc">on
February 11</font>, after releasing a new song &quot;Real Friends&quot;
and a snippet of the song &quot;No More Parties in L.A.&quot; with
Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative, where
Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On 26 January 2016, West
revealed that he had named his album SWISH <font color="#2f4f4f">Waves
</font>and also announced the premiere of his<font color="#556b2f">
Yeezy Season 3 </font>clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In
early 2016, several weeks before the release of his new album, West
became embroiled in a brief social media spat on Twitter with rapper
<font color="#6b8e23">Wiz Khalifa</font>, which eventually involved
their mutual ex-partner Amber Rose, who protested West's mention of
her and Khalifa's child. The dispute concerned Rose's claims about
her sexual relationship with West, and it received a lot of media
attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled.
Several days before the album's release, West changed the album's
name again, this time to <font color="#a0522d">The Life of Pablo</font>.
On 11 February, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as
part of the launch of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. After the
preview, West announced that he would edit the track list one more
time before releasing it to the public and further delayed the
release to finalise the recording of the track &quot;Waves&quot; at
Chance the Rapper's request. He released the album exclusively <font color="#228b22">on
the Tidal online service on </font>14 February 2016 after an
appearance on SNL.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West's musical career has been
defined by frequent stylistic changes, and he has developed and
explored a variety of musical approaches and genres throughout his
work. When asked about his musical inspirations, he has cited A Tribe
Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool
J, Phil Collins and Madonna as early interests. He has also described
musician <font color="#a9a9a9">David Bowie as one of </font>his
&quot;major inspirations&quot; and called producer <font color="#dcdcdc">Puff
Daddy </font>&quot;the most important cultural figure in my life&quot;.
Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production known as
&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">chipmunk soul</font>&quot;, which used
samples of sound, usually from soul and R&amp;B songs, as well as his
own drums and instruments. His first major release with his trademark
soulful song-sampling style was <font color="#556b2f">&quot;This
Can't Be Life&quot;</font>, a song from Jay-Z's The Dynasty: Roc La
Familia. West has said <font color="#6b8e23">Wu-Tang Clan </font>producer
RZA influenced his style, and he has cited Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface
Killah and Ol' Dirty Bastard as his inspirations. RZA welcomed the
comparisons, stating in an interview with Rolling Stone, &quot;It's
all good. I have super respect for Kanye [...] [he] inspires people
to be like him&quot;. West further developed his style with his 2004
debut album The College Dropout. After the rough version leaked, he
fine-tuned the production by adding string arrangements, gospel
choirs and better drum programming.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On his second album Late
Registration (2005), he collaborated with film music composer <font color="#a9a9a9">Jon
Brion </font>and drew on non-rap influences such as the English trip
hop band <font color="#dcdcdc">Portishead</font>. West's primarily
soulful hip hop production and Brion's skilled chamber pop
orchestration merged, and the album incorporated an experimentally
broad range of genres and prominent <font color="#2f4f4f">orchestral
elements, including string arrangements, piano chords, brass and
horns among other symphonic instruments.</font> It also included a
myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not typically found in
popular music, let alone hip-hop, such as celesta, harpsichord,
Chamberlin, CS-80 analogue synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau,
vibraphones and marimba. Rolling Stone described Late Registration as
West claiming &quot;the entire music world as a hip-hop turf&quot;
and said the album was &quot;his mad attempt to explode every cliché
about hip-hop identity&quot;. Critic Robert Christgau wrote that
&quot;hiphop has never been so musically complex and subtle&quot;.
For a time, Kanye West was the only current pop star to tour with a
<font color="#556b2f">string section</font>, as heard on his 2006
live album Late Orchestration.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On his third album, <font color="#a9a9a9">Graduation
</font>(<font color="#dcdcdc">2007</font>), West moved away from the
sound of his earlier releases and towards <font color="#2f4f4f">a
more atmospheric, rock-tinged, electronic-influenced soundscape</font>.
His musical evolution began with listening to European Britpop and
Eurodisco, American alternative and indie rock, and homegrown Chicago
house. To do this, West stripped away much of the live
instrumentation typical of the previous album and replaced it with
heavy, gothic synths, distorted synthesizer chords, rave beats, house
beats, electro-disco rhythms and a wide range of modulated electronic
sounds and digital sound effects. West also drew musical inspiration
from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones, U2 and Led Zeppelin
<font color="#556b2f">for melody and chord progressions</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West's fourth studio album, 808s &amp;
Heartbreak (2008), marked an even more radical departure from his
previous releases, largely abandoning the rap and hip hop genres in
favour of a stark electropop sound consisting of virtual synthesis, a
Roland TR-808 drum machine and explicitly autotuned vocal sounds.
Drawing inspiration from artists such as <font color="#dcdcdc">Gary
Numan, TJ Swan and </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Boy George, </font>and
maintaining a &quot;minimal but functional&quot; approach to the
album's studio production, West explored the electronic feel created
by the Auto-Tune tuning and exploited the sounds created by the 808
by manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted, electronic sound;
he then sought to juxtapose the mechanical sounds with the
traditional sounds of traditional magic drums and choral monks. The
album's music features stark production and elements such as <font color="#556b2f">dense
drums, long strings, droning synthesizers and dark piano, and </font>evoked
comparisons to the work of 1980s <font color="#6b8e23">post-punk </font>and
new wave groups, with West himself later acknowledging a kinship with
British post-punk group Joy Division. <font color="#a0522d">Rolling
Stone </font>editor Matthew Trammell claimed the album was ahead of
its time, writing in a 2012 article, &quot;Now that popular music has
finally caught up with it, 808s &amp; Heartbreak has emerged as
Kanye's most vulnerable work and perhaps his most brilliant.&quot;</p>

for its maximalist aesthetic and for incorporating elements from
West's previous four albums. Entertainment Weekly's <font color="#dcdcdc">Simon
Vozick-Levinson suggests </font>that such elements &quot;recur all
over the place&quot;, namely &quot;the luxurious soul of 2004's The
College Dropout, the symphonic grandeur of Late Registration, the
gloss of 2007's Graduation and the emotionally exhausted electro of
2008's <font color="#2f4f4f">808s &amp; Heartbreak</font>&quot;. Sean
Fennessey of The Village Voice writes that West &quot;hand-suck[ed]

as <font color="#2f4f4f">a </font>&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">protest
to music&quot;</font>, West adopted an abrasive style that included
industrial music, acid house, dancehall, punk, electro and Chicago
drill. Inspired by <font color="#556b2f">Le Corbusier's </font>minimalist
design and predominantly electronic in nature, the album features
distorted drum machines and &quot;synthesizers that sound like
they're out of tune, low-resolution samplers that add a pixelated
digital aura to the most analogue sounds&quot;. To this end, the
album contains glitches that resemble CD skipping or corrupted MP3s,
and Auto-Tuned vocals are modulated to the point where they are
difficult to decipher. It also continues West's practice of eclectic
samples: he uses a sample from Nina Simone's 'Strange Fruit', an
obscure Hindi sample on 'I Am a God' and a sample from 1970s
Hungarian rock band Omega on 'New Slaves'. &quot;On Sight&quot;
interpolates the melody from Holy Name of Mary Choral Family's
&quot;Sermon (He'll Give Us What We Really Need)&quot;. Rolling Stone
called the album &quot;a brilliant, obsessive career

a Twitter announcement that directed fans to the yeezy.supply domain.
In <font color="#556b2f">2015</font>, West unveiled his Yeezy Season
apparel collection, with the first season 1 being presented in
collaboration with Adidas earlier this year. The launch of Yeezy
Boosts and the entire Adidas collaboration was unveiled in New York
on February 12, 2015, and was streamed for free in 50 cinemas in 13
countries around the world. The first release of the Adidas Yeezy
Boosts collection was limited to 9,000 pairs, available only in New
York via the Adidas smartphone app; the Adidas Yeezy Boosts sold out

company named after his late <font color="#dcdcdc">mother, Donda

West expressed the need to &quot;put creative people in a room with

jointly own Tidal, with a majority stake of 3%. The idea of a fully

<font color="#6b8e23">Spotify, which </font>have been criticised for

an outspoken and controversial celebrity who has received both
criticism and praise from many quarters, including the mainstream

<font color="#a9a9a9">September 2, </font>2005 NBC Katrina relief
concert, <font color="#dcdcdc">A Concert for Hurricane Relief, </font>West
(as speaker) accused President <font color="#2f4f4f">George W. Bush
of </font>&quot;not caring about black people&quot;. While performing
with actor Mike Myers, West deviated from the prepared script and
criticised the media's portrayal of hurricane victims, saying:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Bush said in an interview that the
comment was <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;one of the most disgusting
moments of his presidency&quot;</font>. In November 2010, in a taped
interview with <font color="#dcdcdc">Matt Lauer on the </font>Today
programme, West apologised for criticising Bush. &quot;I would say to
George Bush in my moment of frustration that I had no basis for
calling him a racist,&quot; he told Lauer. &quot;I think that in a
high-emotion situation like this, we as human beings don't always
choose the right words.&quot; The following day, Bush responded to
the apology in a live interview with Lauer, saying he appreciated the
rapper's remorse. &quot;I'm not a hater,&quot; Bush said. &quot;I
don't hate Kanye West. I was talking about an environment where
people were willing to say things that hurt. Nobody wants to be
called a racist if in their heart they believe in racial equality.&quot;
Reactions were mixed, but some felt West didn't need to apologise.
&quot;The specifics of your words didn't matter, it was basically
about a feeling of insensitivity towards our communities that many of
us have felt for far too long,&quot; argued Def Jam co-founder
Russell Simmons. Bush himself welcomed the apology, saying: &quot;I
appreciate it. Not only did Kanye West talk like that during Katrina,
I cited him as an example, I cited others as examples. You know, I
appreciate it.&quot;</p>

Kazakhstan. </font>He travelled to Kazakhstan, which has one of the
<font color="#dcdcdc">worst </font>human rights records in the world,
as Nazarbayev's personal guest. Other prominent Western performers,
including Sting, have previously cancelled appearances in the country
because of <font color="#2f4f4f">human rights concerns</font>. West
was reportedly paid <font color="#556b2f">$3 million </font>for his
appearance. West had previously taken part in a cultural boycott and,
like Shakira and Rage Against The Machine, refused to perform <font color="#6b8e23">in

Washington: 'Let me tell you something about George Bush and oil
money and Obama and no money. People like to say that Obama can't
make these moves or he won't make them. That's because he doesn't

that <font color="#2f4f4f">Jews have... </font>We are not Jews. We
don't have a family with that kind of money.&quot; In response to his

power in government.&quot; On <font color="#556b2f">December 21,

saying: &quot;I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I trick -
you can never take away the amount of work I put into it. I don't
want to hear all that politically correct stuff.&quot; On 2 November
2006, after his song &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Touch the Sky</font>&quot;
failed to win Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards, West went on
stage when the award was presented to Justice and Simian for &quot;We

paparazzi and broke photographers' cameras. West was later released
from the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division station in
Culver City on <font color="#556b2f">$20,000 </font>bail. On
September 26, 2008, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office
announced that it would not pursue criminal charges against West in
connection with the incident. Instead, the case file was turned over
to the City Attorney's Office, which charged West with <font color="#6b8e23">one
count of vandalism, one count of grand larceny, and one count of
assault</font>, and his manager with three of those charges on March
18, 2009. The arraignment of West and Crowley was postponed from the
original April 14, 2009 date.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On 19 July 2013, West was leaving
LAX airport surrounded by dozens of paparazzi. West became
increasingly agitated when photographer <font color="#dcdcdc">Daniel
Ramos </font>asked him why people were not allowed to speak in his
presence. West then said: &quot;I told you, I'm not allowed to talk
to people. You're trying to get me in trouble so I can steal from you
and have to pay $1,000250 and shit. &quot; He then allegedly attacked
the man and grabbed him and his camera. The incident, captured by
TMZ, lasted a few seconds before the woman's voice can be heard
telling West to stop. West then let go of the man and his camera and
drove away from the scene. Paramedics were later called to the scene
on behalf of the captured photographer. West was told he could face
charges of aggravated attempted robbery behind the case. However, the
charges were reduced to <font color="#556b2f">criminal </font>mischief
<font color="#556b2f">and attempted theft. </font>In March 2014, West
was sentenced to a two-year suspended prison term for the assault
conviction, and was required to attend 24 anger management sessions,
perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to Ramos.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West <font color="#a9a9a9">is one of
the most respected </font>artists of the 21st century, and his work
has been praised by music critics, fans, musicians, artists and the
wider cultural community. AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier writes of
his influence: &quot;As his career progressed throughout the early
2000s, West shattered certain stereotypes of rappers and emerged as a
superstar on his own terms, without conforming his appearance,
rhetoric or music to any particular musical mould.&quot; The New York
Times' <font color="#dcdcdc">Jon Caramanic </font>said that West has
been &quot;a frequent salamander of controversy, a bombshell who can
count the bullying of two presidents among his accomplishments, plus
a reliably dyspeptic presence at awards galas (when he attends
them).&quot; Village Voice Media senior editor <font color="#2f4f4f">Ben
Westhoff </font>called him the greatest hip-hop artist of all time,
writing that &quot;he has made the best albums and changed the game
the most, and his music is the most likely to endure&quot;, while
Complex called him the &quot;most important artist of the 21st
century in any art form and in any genre&quot;. <font color="#556b2f">The
Guardian </font>has compared West <font color="#6b8e23">to David
Bowie</font>, claiming that &quot;no one else can sell as many
records as West (around 30 million albums sold) and remain so
resolutely experimental and capable of mixing things up culturally
and politically&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West's <font color="#a9a9a9">middle-class
</font>background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have
also set him apart from other rappers. Early in his career, he was
one of the first rappers to publicly criticise the prevalence of
<font color="#dcdcdc">homophobia in hip hop. </font>The sales battle
between rapper <font color="#2f4f4f">50 </font>Cent's Curtis and
West's Graduation changed the direction of hip hop and helped pave
the way for new rappers who did not follow the fashion of hardcore
gangsters. The Guardian's Rosie Swash saw the sales contest as a
historic moment in hip hop because it &quot;highlighted the divergent
sides of hip hop in the last decade; the former was <font color="#556b2f">gangsta
rap </font>for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's
alternative&quot;. Rolling Stone praised West for changing the
mainstream of hip hop, &quot;establishing a style of introspective
but glossy rap [...]&quot;, and called him &quot;as interesting and
complex a pop star as the 2000s have produced - a rapper who
mastered, improved and moved beyond the hip hop game, a producer who
created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a
flashy, free-spirited rapper with insightful things to say about
academia, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough
artistic firepower to back it up&quot;. His 2008 album 808s &amp;
Heartbreak polarised listeners and critics immediately after its
release, but was commercially successful and influenced hip hop and
pop genres as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who
usually eschewed the typical rap rap brag culture in favour of
intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The
Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief
Keef and Soulja Boy. According to <font color="#6b8e23">Ben Detrick
</font>of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists
like Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall and Drake who had
no interest or ability in rapping about guns or drug dealing.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">West's work has influenced or been
praised by numerous artists and others, including Wu-Tang Clan's RZA,
Public Enemy's Chuck D and Gang Starr's DJ Premier. Both Drake and
Casey Veggies have admitted to being directly influenced by West.
Non-rap artists such as English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily
Allen, New Zealander Lorde, rock band Arctic Monkeys, pop singer
Halsey, Sergio Pizzorno of English rock band Kasabian and US indie
rock band MGMT have also cited West as an influence. Experimental and
electronic artists such as James Blake Daniel Lopatin and Tim Hecker
have also cited West as an inspiration. Experimental rock pioneer and
Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed wrote in a review of West's
Yeezus album that &quot;the guy is really, really, really talented.
He really tries to raise the bar. No one comes close to what he does,
it's not even on the same planet&quot;. Musicians such as Paul
McCartney and Prince have also praised West's work. Famous Tesla

critical acclaim. All of his albums have been commercially
successful, and <font color="#a9a9a9">Yeezus</font>, his sixth solo
album, was his fifth consecutive number 1 album in the US immediately
after its release. West's six songs have surpassed 3 million digital
