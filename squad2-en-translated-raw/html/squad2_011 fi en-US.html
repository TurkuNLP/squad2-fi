Germanic tribes lived in the Hun kingdom of Attila. Attila had both
Hun and Germanic families and important Germanic chieftains in his
immediate circle in Europe. The Huns living in the Germanic regions
of <font color="#8b0000">Eastern Europe </font>adopted the <font color="#483d8b">East

during the Huns' campaign against the Roman Empire. After Attila's

</font>are considered to be the most important groups involved in the
formation of the Germanic peoples. The varieties of the <font color="#6b8e23">German
language </font>are further subdivided into these groups. Linguists
distinguish between Low German, Franconian, Bavarian, Thuringian and
Low Germanic varieties of modern German. By the <font color="#a0522d">9th

Roman Catholic Church and local rulers </font>led the German
expansion and settlement into areas inhabited by Slavs and Baltic
peoples, known as the <font color="#2f4f4f">Ostsiedlung</font>.
During the wars fought by <font color="#556b2f">the Catholic Teutonic
Order of German </font>in the Baltic Sea, the Germans conquered the
areas inhabited by the old Prussian ethnic group (the current
reference to the people then known simply as '<font color="#6b8e23">Prussians').
The </font>Old Prussians were an ethnic group related to the <font color="#a0522d">Latvian
and Lithuanian Baltic peoples. The </font>former German Prussian
state took its name from the Baltic Prussians, although it was run by
Germans who had assimilated the Old Prussians; the Old <font color="#228b22">Prussian
</font>language had become extinct <font color="#191970">in the 17th
or early 1700s</font>. The Slavs of the Teutonic-dominated Baltic
<font color="#8b0000">were assimilated into German culture</font>,

sovereign debt crisis, Polish Foreign Minister <font color="#a9a9a9">Radek
Sikorski </font>said in November 2011: 'I am probably the first
Polish Foreign Minister in history to say this, but here it is': 'I
am less afraid of German power than I am of German inaction.' You
have become an indispensable nation in Europe.&quot; According to
Jacob Heilbrunn, senior editor of The National Interest, such a
statement is unprecedented given Germany's history. &quot;This was an
extraordinary statement from the highest official of a country that
Germany destroyed during the Second World War. And it reflects a
profound change in the whole of Germany and Europe about Berlin's
position at the centre of the continent.&quot; <font color="#2f4f4f">Heilbrunn
</font>believes that the saying &quot;what was good for Germany was
bad for the European Union&quot; has been replaced by a new way of
thinking - what is in Germany's interest is also in the interest of
its neighbours. The evolution of German national identity is due to
less focus on <font color="#556b2f">the Nazi past </font>and more on
<font color="#6b8e23">the history of Prussia</font>, which many
Germans believe was betrayed by <font color="#a0522d">Nazism </font>-
and which it did not represent. It is also driven by Germany'<font color="#228b22">s</font>
prominent position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, Germany's
influence has been welcomed by its neighbours, as Poland's foreign
minister Radek Sikorski's praise of his country's western neighbour
shows. This change of mindset is supported by a newer generation of
Germans who see the <font color="#191970">Second World War as a

converted to Islam in 1267, and King Parameswara of Malacca married
Pasai's princess and the son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon
Malacca became a centre of Islamic research and maritime trade, and
other rulers followed suit. <font color="#228b22">Hamka </font>(1908-1981),

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There are several theories about the
process of Islamization in Southeast Asia. One theory is trade. The
expansion of trade between West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped
the spread of the religion, as Muslim traders from South Yemen
(Hadramout) brought Islam to the region through a large volume of
trade. Many settled in <font color="#a9a9a9">Indonesia, Singapore and
Malaysia.</font> This is reflected in the Arab Indonesian, Arab
Singaporean and Arab Malay populations that were once very
significant in each country. Another theory is the role of the
missionaries, the Sufis: <font color="#2f4f4f">the Sufi missionaries
played an </font>important role in spreading the faith by bringing
Islamic ideas to the region. Eventually, the ruling classes adopted
Islam, which further contributed to the spread of the religion
throughout the region. The ruler of the most important port in the
region, the <font color="#556b2f">Sultanate of Malacca, </font>embraced
Islam in the 15th century, ushering in a period of accelerated
conversion to Islam throughout the region, as <font color="#6b8e23">Islam
</font>was a positive force among the <font color="#a0522d">ruling

Hill&quot;.</font> After local residents disputed that BYU had
purchased this land, construction began in 1909 on the first building
on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial. Brimhall also led
the university during a brief crisis in <font color="#483d8b">evolutionary
theory.</font> The religious nature of the school at the time seemed
to clash with this scientific theory. LDS Church President Joseph F.
Smith resolved the issue for a time <font color="#3cb371">by
requesting that </font><font color="#bc8f8f">evolution </font><font color="#3cb371">not
be taught in the school.</font> Some have described the school at the
time as nothing more than a 'religious seminary'. However, many of
the school's graduates at the time did well and became well known in
their fields.</p>

Harris </font>was appointed president of the university in 1921, the
first BYU president to hold a <font color="#dcdcdc">doctorate </font><font color="#2f4f4f">degree</font>.
Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it
into a true university, whereas before its organization had remnants
of the academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was
not officially recognised as a university by any accrediting body. By
the end of his mandate, the school had been accredited by all the
main accrediting bodies at the time. He was eventually replaced by
<font color="#556b2f">Howard S. McDonald, who had received his
</font>doctorate from the University of California. When he first
took office, <font color="#6b8e23">World War II had just ended </font>and
BYU was seeing an influx of thousands of students. By the end of his
tenure, the school had grown <font color="#a0522d">almost fivefold,
with a </font>student body of 5,440. The university didn't have the
facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of <font color="#228b22">an
Air Force base </font>in Ogden, Utah, and rebuilt it to house some of
the students. The next president, <font color="#191970">Ernest L.
Wilkinson, </font>also oversaw the vigorous growth as the school
adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible
for the construction of more than eighty buildings on campus, many of
which are still standing. During his tenure, student enrollment
<font color="#8b0000">increased six-fold</font>, making BYU the
largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also
increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school.
Finally, <font color="#483d8b">Wilkinson </font>reorganized the LDS
Church's units on campus, adding ten stakes and <font color="#3cb371">more
than 100 </font>departments during his administration.</p>

the university drew up a <font color="#dcdcdc">new statement on
academic freedom, </font>which specified that restrictions could be
placed on &quot;expression with students or in public that: (1)
<font color="#2f4f4f">contradicts or opposes rather </font>than
analyzes or discusses basic Church doctrine or policy; (2)
intentionally attacks or mocks the Church or its public leaders; or
(3) violates <font color="#556b2f">the honor code </font>because the
expression is dishonest, illegal, indecent, obscene, profane, or
unreasonably disrespectful of others.&quot; These restrictions have
caused some controversy, as <font color="#6b8e23">several </font>professors
have been punished under the new rule. The <font color="#228b22">American
Association of University Professors </font>has argued that
<font color="#191970">&quot;violations of academic freedom are
worryingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is
worryingly bad&quot;. The </font>new rules have not affected <font color="#8b0000">BYU's
accreditation</font>, as the university's chosen accrediting body
allows &quot;religious colleges and universities to impose
restrictions on academic freedom as long as they publish those
restrictions openly,&quot; according to Jim Gordon, deputy director
of the Associate Academy. <font color="#483d8b">The AAUP</font>'s
concern was not the faculty member's restrictions on religious
expression, but that BYU had not adequately defined the restrictions
in advance, as the faculty member and the AAUP argued: &quot;The AAUP
requires that all doctrinal restrictions on academic freedom be
clearly stated in writing. We [AAUP] found that BYU had not done so
adequately.&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">BYU has <font color="#a9a9a9">21
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">NCAA teams</font>. Nineteen of those
teams played primarily <font color="#2f4f4f">in the Mountain West
Conference </font>from its inception in 1999 until the school left
the conference in 2011. Prior to that, BYU teams competed in the
Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named <font color="#556b2f">&quot;Cougars,&quot;
</font>and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953.
The school's fight song is the <font color="#6b8e23">Cougar Fight
Song. </font>Because <font color="#a0522d">many of its players </font><font color="#228b22">serve
full-time missions for two years </font>(men at age 18, women at age
19), BYU athletes are often older on average than players from other
schools. The NCAA allows student athletes to serve two years as a
broadcaster without reducing this time from their eligibility. This
has caused some minor controversy, but it is largely recognized that
it does not provide a significant benefit to the school because
players do not receive athletic and little physical training during
their missionary work. BYU has also come under scrutiny from sports
channels for refusing to play games <font color="#191970">on Sundays
and </font>expelling players for violating <font color="#8b0000">honor
codes</font>. Since the 2011 season, BYU football competes in
university football as an independent team. In addition, most other
sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. The men's and
women's swimming and diving teams and the men's and women's track and
field teams joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars
became independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic
Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to
the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season. The
softball program may move again after the 2013 season; in July 2013,
Pacific's return to the WCC will allow the conference to add softball
as an official sport.</p>

irrespective of their religion, must agree to abide by the code of
honour. Early forms of the honor code in the church education system
date back to Brigham Young Academy and the school's early president,
Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created a &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">home
society,&quot; a </font>group of teachers who <font color="#dcdcdc">visited
students in their homes to see that they were following the school's
moral code, which forbade obscenity, profanity, smoking and alcohol
use. </font>The <font color="#2f4f4f">honour code </font>itself was
not created until <font color="#556b2f">around 1940 and </font>was
mainly used <font color="#6b8e23">in cases of cheating and academic
dishonesty. </font>President Wilkinson expanded <font color="#a0522d">the
Honor Code </font>in <font color="#228b22">1957 </font>to include
other school rules. This led to what the Honor Code stands for today:
rules on chastity, dress, hygiene, drugs and alcohol. A signed
commitment to the Honor Code is part of the application process, and
<font color="#191970">all students, teachers and staff </font>must
abide by it. Students and teachers who break the rules will either be
warned or invited to meet with representatives of the local council.
In certain cases, students and teachers may be dismissed from the
school or lose their jobs. Both LDS and non-LDS students must meet
annually with the head of the church to obtain ecclesiastical
approval for both admission and continuation. Various LGBT advocacy
groups have opposed the honor code and criticised it as anti-gay, and

thriving department stores by the mid to late 19th century.
Increasingly, <font color="#a9a9a9">women </font>became the biggest
shoppers and middle-class households. <font color="#dcdcdc">Kendals
(formerly Kendal Milne &amp; Faulkner) in </font>Manchester was one
of the first department stores, and many of its customers still know
it as Kendal's, although it changed its name <font color="#2f4f4f">to
House of Fraser </font>in 2005. The Manchester institution dates back
to <font color="#556b2f">1836, but has been </font>operating under
the name Watts Bazaar since 1796. At its peak, the bazaar consisted
of buildings on either side of Deansgate, connected by an underground
passage called 'Kendals Arcade', and an Art Nouveau-style tiled
dining room. The store was particularly known for its emphasis on
quality and style at low prices, hence the nickname 'Harrods of the
North', although this was partly due to the fact that <font color="#6b8e23">Harrods
</font>bought the store in 1919. Other major Manchester stores
included Paulden's (now Debenhams) and Lewis's (now Primark).</p>

techniques were adopted by modern department stores around the world.
The store was widely advertised <font color="#2f4f4f">through paid
advertising</font>. Store premises were built to make goods more
accessible to customers. The store had elegant restaurants at modest
prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms
for French, German, American and 'colonial' customers, a first aid
room and a quiet room with soft lights, deep chairs and double
glazing, all designed to keep customers in the store as long as
possible. Staff were taught to help customers, but not too
aggressively, and to sell merchandise. Selfridge's <font color="#556b2f">also
</font>attracted <font color="#556b2f">customers with educational and
scientific displays</font>; - in 1909 Louis Blériot's monoplane was

Au Bon Marché </font>was established in Paris in 1838 to sell lace,
ribbons, sheets, mattresses, buttons, umbrellas and other
miscellaneous goods. It originally had four departments, twelve
employees and three hundred metres of floor space. Entrepreneur
<font color="#dcdcdc">Aristide Boucicaut </font>became a partner in
1852 and changed the marketing plan by introducing fixed prices and
guarantees, allowing for exchanges and returns, advertising and a
much wider range of goods. The shop's annual revenue <font color="#2f4f4f">increased
from 500 000 francs in 1852 to five million francs in 1860. </font>In
1869, he built a much larger building at 24 rue de Sèvres on the
Left Bank and re-extended the shop in 1872 with the help of <font color="#556b2f">Gustave
Eiffel's </font>engineering firm, which created the Eiffel Tower.
Revenues rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million francs
at Boucicaut's death in 1877. The surface area had increased from
three hundred to fifty thousand square metres in 1838, and the number
of employees had increased from twelve in 1838 to seventeen in 1879.
Boucicaut was famous for <font color="#6b8e23">its marketing
innovations</font>: a reading room for husbands while their wives
shopped, extensive newspaper advertising, entertainment for children
and six million catalogues sent to customers. By 1880, half of the
employees were women; unmarried female employees lived in dormitories
on the upper floors.</p>

Constable </font>was the first American department store. It was
founded in 1825 by <font color="#dcdcdc">Aaron Arnold </font>(1794?-1876),
an immigrant from Great Britain, as a small dry goods store on Pine
Street in New York City. In 1857, the department store moved into <font color="#2f4f4f">a
five-storey white marble dry goods palace known as Marble House</font><font color="#556b2f">.
</font>During the Civil War, Arnold, Constable <font color="#6b8e23">was

instead of semi-annual bills. The </font>store, known as a trading

corner of Broadway and Nineteenth Street; this &quot;palace of
commerce&quot; expanded over the years until it was necessary to move
to larger premises in 1914. In 1925, Arnold, Constable merged with
Stewart &amp; Company and expanded into the suburbs, first to New
Rochelle, New York, with a store opening in 1937, and later to

Stewart founded the &quot;Marble Palace&quot; restaurant in 1846 <font color="#a9a9a9">on
Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets</font>. He offered
European retail goods at fixed prices for a variety of dry goods and
advertised that <font color="#dcdcdc">all potential customers </font>were
offered <font color="#dcdcdc">'free admission'.</font> Although the
building was clad in white marble to resemble a Renaissance palace,
its cast-iron structure allowed for large glass windows to
accommodate large seasonal displays, especially during the Christmas
shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store for the entire
block, with eight floors and <font color="#556b2f">nineteen
</font>departments of clothing and furnishings, rugs, glass and
china, toys and sporting goods, located in a central glass-roofed
courtyard. Among his innovations were the following: buying from
manufacturers in cash and in large quantities, keeping profit margins
low and prices low, truthful presentation of goods, a one-price
policy (so there was no need to haggle), simple returns and cash
back, <font color="#6b8e23">cash </font>sales <font color="#6b8e23">rather
than credit</font>, shoppers looking for quality goods from all over
the world, departmentalisation, vertical and horizontal integration,
volume sales and free services for customers such as <font color="#a0522d">waiting

quickly copied his innovation.</p>

of the <font color="#6b8e23">personal shopper, a </font>service that
was offered free of charge in every Field's store until the last days
of the chain under the Marshall Field's name. It was the first store
to offer standby credit and the first department store to use

store was legendary; it pioneered the concept of &quot;signing&quot;.
In addition, the windows of Marshall Field's downtown stores were
filled each Christmas with live displays as part of the downtown
shopping district's exhibit; the &quot;theme&quot; window displays
became famous for their ingenuity and beauty, and visiting Marshall
Field's Christmas windows became a tradition for Chicagoans and

and its equally famous Christmas tree or meeting &quot;under the

department stores, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">Grace Bros. and
Waltons</font>, for most of the 20th century, many of them
disappeared in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, Myer and David Jones,
located nationwide, are effectively Australia's national department
store duo. When Russian-born immigrant Sidney Myer arrived in
Australia in <font color="#dcdcdc">1899, </font>he and his brother
Elcon Myer established the Myer group of stores. In 1900, they opened
the first Myer department store in <font color="#2f4f4f">Bendigo,
Victoria.</font> Since then, the Myer retail group has grown to
become Australia's largest retailer. Both Myer and David Jones are
<font color="#556b2f">upmarket chains </font>offering a wide range of
products from mid-priced names to luxury brands. Other retail chains
such as Target (not affiliated with the American chain of the same
name), <font color="#6b8e23">Venture </font>(now defunct), Kmart and
Big W, also located nationwide, are considered to be Australian
discount stores. Harris Scarfe, although operating in only four
states and one region, is a department store that uses both the
formats of a large full-line department store and a small discount
store. Most department stores in Australia have their own credit card
companies with their own benefits, while discount stores do not have
their own credit card privileges.</p>

department store with branches across the country. It also previously

department store, which ceased to exist in March 2013 after selling
its leasehold interest to Target Canada. Other department stores in
Canada include Ogilvy, Les Ailes de la Mode, Giant Tiger, Co-op,
Costco and Holt Renfrew. Superstore, the grocery giant, has many
non-grocery items similar to a department store. Woolco had <font color="#556b2f">160
</font>stores in Canada when it closed (Woolco was bought by Walmart
in 1994). Today, low-cost Walmart is by far the most dominant
department store retailer in Canada, with stores across the country.
Historically, department stores were an important part of the
Canadian economy, and chain stores such as Eaton's, Charles Ogilvy
Limited, Freiman's, Spencer's, Simpson's, Morgan's and Woodward's
were pillars of their respective communities. Canadian department
stores are similar in structure and style to those in the United

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Before the 1950s, the department
store played a major role in both Canada and Australia during both
the Great Depression and the Second World War. Since then, they have
suffered from fierce competition from <font color="#a9a9a9">specialist
retailers. </font>More recently, competition has intensified with the
entry of <font color="#dcdcdc">big-box stores </font>(Jones et al.
1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason
for the declining role of department stores; they were also affected
by changes in urban structure. The compact and centralised 19th
century city, with public transport lines running into the city
centre, was the perfect environment for the growth of department
stores. But as <font color="#2f4f4f">residents moved out of the city
centre to the suburbs</font>, the large department stores in the city
centre became unwieldy and lost business to the new suburban shopping
centres. In <font color="#556b2f">2003, </font>department store sales
in the US surpassed those of big box stores for the first time
(although some stores can be classified as &quot;big box stores&quot;
based on physical appearance and &quot;department stores&quot; based
on merchandise).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Socialism met consumer culture in
<font color="#a9a9a9">the state-run department store chain (GUM), a
</font>model retail enterprise <font color="#2f4f4f">founded by </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Lenin
</font>in <font color="#2f4f4f">1921.</font> It had stores all over
Russia and targeted consumers across class, gender and ethnic lines.
The GUM was designed to promote the Bolsheviks' goals of abolishing
private enterprise and rebuilding consumption on socialist
principles, and democratising consumption by workers and peasants
throughout the country. The GUM became a major propaganda
disseminator, with advertising and promotional campaigns designed to
teach Russians about the aims of the regime and to inculcate new
attitudes and behaviour. In an attempt to create a socialist consumer
culture from scratch, the GUM redefined the functions and meanings of
buying and selling, transforming them into politically charged acts
that could either promote or retard the advance of utopian communism.
<font color="#556b2f">By the late 1920s, </font>however, the GUM's
grandiose ambitions had proved unrealistic and largely alienated
consumers, who instead learned a culture of complaint and
justification. GUM's main task was to distribute whatever the
factories sent them, regardless of consumer demand or quality.</p>

Newcastle </font>(formerly <font color="#dcdcdc">Bainbridge</font>)
Newcastle upon Tyne is the oldest department store in the world. Many
customers still know it as Bainbridge, although it has changed its
name to John Lewis. The Newcastle institution began in 1838, when
21-year-old <font color="#2f4f4f">Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge
</font>partnered with William Alder Dunn to open a cloth and fashion
shop <font color="#556b2f">in Newcastle's Market Street.</font> In
terms of retail history, one of the most significant facts about
Newcastle's Bainbridge store is that as early as 1849, weekly
receipts were recorded by department, making it the earliest of all
department stores. This record has survived and is preserved in the
John Lewis archives. John Lewis bought the Bainbridge store in <font color="#6b8e23">1952.</font></p>

Its stores were geared toward motorists - they were located away from
existing business centers in the heart of the target group's
neighborhoods, had ample free off-street parking, and had a clear
corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully

<font color="#a0522d">This view of </font><font color="#228b22">absolute

emphasise international harmonisation. There has also been much

entails. The question remains open in legal research.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The growth of <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Internet</font>, and in particular decentralised search engines such
as Kazaa and Gnutella, has been a challenge for copyright policy. In
particular, the <font color="#dcdcdc">Recording Industry Association
of America has been at </font>the forefront of the fight against
<font color="#2f4f4f">copyright infringement</font>, which the
industry calls piracy. The industry has won against some services,
including a highly publicised case against the file-sharing company
Napster, and some people have been prosecuted for file-sharing in
breach of copyright. In the <font color="#6b8e23">electronic age,
</font>there have been increasing attempts to use software-based
digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of
digital works. Laws such as the <font color="#228b22">Digital
Millennium Copyright Act </font>have been enacted using criminal law
to prevent the circumvention of software used to apply digital rights
management systems. Similar provisions to prevent circumvention of
copyright protection have existed in the EU for some time and have
been extended, for example, in <font color="#191970">Articles 6 and 7
of </font>the Copyright Directive. Other examples include Article 7
of the 1991 Software Directive (91/250/EEC) and the <font color="#8b0000">1998
</font>Conditional Access Directive (98/84/EEC), which can prevent
<font color="#483d8b">legitimate uses that </font>affect publicly
available works, copyright limitations and exceptions, or uses
authorised by the copyright holder. Some copyleft licences, such as
the GNU GPL 3, are designed to address this. Legislation may permit
circumvention under certain conditions, such as when necessary to
achieve interoperability with the circumventor's software or for
accessibility reasons; however, it may be illegal to distribute
circumvention tools or instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Before forming Queen, Brian May and
Roger Taylor had played together in a band <font color="#a9a9a9">called
Smile</font>. <font color="#dcdcdc">Freddie Mercury </font>(then
known by his birth name Farrokh &quot;Freddie&quot; Bulsara) was a
fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more
sophisticated stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band
in 1970, suggested the new band name &quot;Queen&quot; and adopted
his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited ahead of the
recording of their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted
in the UK with their second album Queen II in 1974, but it was not
until Sheer Heart Attack, released later that year, and A Night at
the Opera, released in 1975, that the band achieved international
success. The latter included the song 'Bohemian Rhapsody', which
stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and made the music
video famous. Their 1977 album <font color="#2f4f4f">News of the
World </font>included the songs &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We
Are the Champions&quot;, which have become anthems of sporting
events. By the early 1980s, Queen was one of the biggest stadium rock
bands in the world. Several music publications consider their
performance at the 1985 Live Aid event to be the greatest in rock
history, and in a 2005 industry poll it was rated the best. In 1991
Mercury died of bronchitis, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon
retired in 1997<font color="#556b2f">.</font> Since then, May and
Taylor have performed occasionally together, including with Paul
Rodgers (2004-09) and Adam Lambert (since 2011). In November 2014,
Queen released a new album<font color="#6b8e23">, Queen Forever,
</font>featuring songs by the late Mercury.</p>

Freddie, </font><font color="#a9a9a9">while studying at Ealing Art
College</font>. Bulsara felt he and the band had the same taste and
soon became an avid fan of Smile. In late <font color="#2f4f4f">1970</font>,
after Staffell left to join<font color="#556b2f"> Humpy Bong</font>,
the remaining members of Smile, encouraged by Bulsara, changed their
name to 'Queen' and continued to work together. When asked about the
name, Bulsara explained: &quot;I came up with the name Queen. It's
just a name, but it's obviously very regal, and it sounds great. It's
a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual
potential and was open to all kinds of interpretations. Of course I
was aware of the homosexual connotations, but that was just one
aspect.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The band had several bassists during
this period who did not fit the band's chemistry. It wasn't until
February 1971 that they settled on John Deacon and began rehearsing
for their first album. They recorded four of their own songs, &quot;Liar&quot;,
&quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot; and
&quot;Jesus&quot;, for a demo tape; the record companies were not
interested. Around the same time, Freddie changed his surname to
&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">Mercury&quot;</font>, inspired by the
line &quot;Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me&quot; from
the song &quot;<font color="#556b2f">My Fairy King&quot;</font>. <font color="#6b8e23">On

</font>(Deacon and Taylor), a crab <font color="#2f4f4f">Crab </font>(May)
and two fairies <font color="#556b2f">Virgo </font>(Mercury). The
lions embrace the stylised letter Q, the crab rests on the letter
with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each
sheltered under the lion. There is also a crown inside the letter Q,
and the whole logo is overshadowed by a huge phoenix. The whole
symbol bears a passing resemblance to the royal coat of arms of the
<font color="#6b8e23">United Kingdom</font>, especially for lion
supporters. The original logo on the back of the first album cover
was a simple line drawing, but later covers used more complex colour

<font color="#2f4f4f">Norman Sheffield a </font>band managed by
<font color="#556b2f">Neptune Productions</font>, a subsidiary of
Trident, and allowed them to use Trident's facilities to record new
material while management looked for a record company to sign Queen.
This suited both parties, as Trident was expanding into management
and the deal allowed Queen to use the state-of-the-art recording
equipment used by bands like the Beatles and <font color="#6b8e23">Elton
John to </font>produce new material. However, Trident found it
difficult to find a record label for a band whose name was so

time. The album was well received by critics; <font color="#2f4f4f">Gordon
Fletcher </font>of Rolling Stone said &quot;their debut album is
brilliant&quot;, and Chicago's Daily Herald called it &quot;an
above-average debut&quot;. However, it didn't attract much mainstream

album, and in 2008 Rolling Stone ranked it 31st on its &quot;100

an iconic photograph of the band by rock photographer <font color="#2f4f4f">Mick
</font>Rock on its cover. This image was used as the basis for the

The album is the first real demonstration of the band's distinctive
layered sound, with long complex instrumental scenes, fantasy-themed
lyrics and musical virtuosity. In addition to its only single, the
album included &quot;The March of the Black Queen&quot;, a <font color="#6b8e23">six-minute

the Uris Theatre in New York in </font>May 1974, Brian May collapsed
and contracted <font color="#dcdcdc">hepatitis</font>. While
recovering, May was initially absent as the band began work on their
third album, but he returned midway through recording. Released in
1974, <font color="#2f4f4f">Sheer Heart Attack </font>reached <font color="#556b2f">number
two </font>in the UK, sold well throughout Europe and went gold in
the US. It gave the band their first real taste of international
success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The album
experimented with different styles of music, including British music
hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime and Caribbean. At this point
Queen began to move away from the progressive tendencies of their
first two albums to a more radio-friendly, song-oriented style. Sheer
Heart Attack introduced new sonic and melodic patterns that would be

after the popular <font color="#dcdcdc">Marx Brothers </font>film. At
the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its
predecessor, the album features a variety of musical styles and
experiments with stereo sound. The middle section of the <font color="#2f4f4f">eight-minute
</font>epic &quot;The Prophet's Song&quot; is a canon, with simple
phrases layered together to create a full choir sound<font color="#2f4f4f">.
The </font>Mercury-composed ballad &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Love

The album was very successful in the UK and went triple platinum in
the US. The British public voted it the 13th best album of all time
in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked high in international
polls: in the global Guinness poll it was voted the 19th best album
of all time, while in an ABC poll the Australian public voted it the
28th best album of all time. A Night at the Opera has often appeared
on &quot;best albums&quot; lists reflecting critics' opinions. Among

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The album also included the hit
single &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which
</font>spent nine weeks at number one in the UK. Mercury's close
friend and advisor, Capital London radio DJ Kenny Everett, played a
key role in promoting the single. It is the third best-selling single
of all time in the UK, surpassed only by Band Aid's &quot;Do They
Know It's Christmas?&quot; and Elton John's &quot;Candle in the Wind
1997&quot;, and is the UK's biggest-selling commercial single. It
also reached number nine in the US (the 1992 re-release was number
two on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks). It is the only single
to have sold a million copies twice, and has been Christmas number
one twice in the UK, the only single ever to do so. &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Bohemian
Rhapsody</font>&quot; has been voted the best song of all time
numerous times. The band decided to make a video to accompany the
single and hired Trilion, a subsidiary of former management company
Trident Studios, to use new technology to make the video; the result
is widely regarded as the first 'proper' music video ever produced
and popularised the medium. The album's first track &quot;Death on
Two Legs&quot; is said to have been written by Mercury about Norman
Sheffield and the former Trident management team who helped make the
video so popular. Although other bands, such as the Beatles, had made
short promotional films or videos for songs before this, they were
usually made specifically for specific television programmes. Rolling
Stone says of Bohemian Rhapsody's influence: &quot;Its impact cannot
be overstated, as it practically invented the music video seven years
before MTV.&quot; The album's second single &quot;You're My Best
Friend&quot;, the second song composed by John Deacon and his first
single, reached number sixteen in the US and became a worldwide Top
Ten hit. The band's A Night at the Opera tour began in November <font color="#2f4f4f">1975,
</font>covering Europe, the <font color="#556b2f">United States,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By 1976, Queen were back in the
studio recording <font color="#a9a9a9">A Day at the Races, which is
</font>often regarded as the follow-up to A Night at the Opera. It
again borrowed the title of the Marx Brothers' film, and had a cover
similar to the cover of A Night at the Opera, which was a variation
of the same Queen crest. The most famous of the Marx Brothers,
<font color="#dcdcdc">Groucho Marx</font>, invited Queen to visit his
Los Angeles home in March 1977, where the band thanked him personally
and performed &quot;'39&quot; a cappella. Musically, A Day at the
Races was considered a strong effort by fans and critics alike,
reaching number one in the UK and Japan and number five in the US.
The album's biggest hit was &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">Somebody to
Love</font>&quot;, a gospel-inspired song in which <font color="#556b2f">Mercury,
May and Taylor </font>multi-tracked their voices to create a
100-voice gospel choir. The song reached number two in the UK and
number thirteen in the US. The album also featured one of the band's
heaviest songs, May's &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Tie Your Mother
Down</font>&quot;, which became the leitmotif of the band's live
performances.</p>

They released their first live album Live Killers in <font color="#a9a9a9">1979</font>;
it went <font color="#dcdcdc">twice </font>platinum in the US. Queen
also released the highly successful single &quot;Crazy Little Thing

Presley.</font> The song reached the top 10 in many countries, topped
the Australian ARIA chart for seven consecutive weeks and was the
band's first number one in the US, where it topped the Billboard Hot
100 chart for four weeks. Mercury had written the song on guitar and
played rhythm guitar on the album, and he played rhythm guitar when
performing the song live, the first time he had ever played guitar in
concert. In December 1979, Queen played at the opening night of the

<font color="#a9a9a9">The Game</font>. It included the singles &quot;Crazy
Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;,
both of which reached number one in the US. After attending a Queen
concert in Los Angeles, <font color="#dcdcdc">Michael Jackson
</font>suggested to Mercury behind the scenes that &quot;Another One
Bites the Dust&quot; be released as a single, and in October 1980 it
spent three weeks at number one. The album spent five weeks at the
top of the Billboard 200 and sold over four million copies in the US.
It was also the first appearance of a synthesizer on a Queen album.
Up until then, their albums had featured the distinctive &quot;No
Synthesisers!&quot; shelf mark. Producer Roy Thomas Baker later
revealed that producer Roy Thomas Baker tried to clarify that the
albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not
synthesizers, as record company executives at the time assumed. In
September 1980, Queen played three sold-out shows <font color="#2f4f4f">at
Madison Square Garden. </font>In 1980, Queen also released the
soundtrack they had recorded for the film<font color="#556b2f"> Flash

</font>travelled to South America as part of The Game Tour, becoming
the first major rock band to perform in Latin American stadiums. The

including one in Buenos Aires which attracted the largest single
concert audience in Argentina's history with a crowd of <font color="#2f4f4f">300,000,
</font>and two concerts at the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil,
where they played to a crowd of over 131,000 on the first night (at
the time the largest paying audience for a single band anywhere in
the world) and over 120,000 the following night. In October of the
same year, Queen played to over 150 000 fans on 9 October in
Monterrey (Estadio Universitario) and on 17 and 18 October in Puebla
(Estadio Zaragoza) in Mexico. On 24 and 25 November, Queen played two

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1982, the band released the album
<font color="#a9a9a9">Hot Space</font>, a departure from their
trademark 70s sound, this time a mix of rock, pop rock, dance, funk
and R&amp;B. Most of the album was recorded <font color="#dcdcdc">in
Munich during </font>the most tumultuous period in the band's
history, and Taylor and May lamented the new sound, and were both
highly critical of the influence of Mercury's personal manager <font color="#2f4f4f">Paul
Prenter </font>on the singer. May also criticised Prenter, who was
Mercury's manager from the early 1980s to 1984, for downplaying the
importance of radio stations such as the US networks and their vital
link between the artist and the community, and for denying them
access to Mercury. The band stopped touring North America after its
Hot Space tour because of waning success there, although it did
appear on American television for the only time on the premiere of
the <font color="#556b2f">eighth season of </font>Saturday Night
Live. Queen left <font color="#6b8e23">Elektra Records</font>, their

musician. The tour included nine sold-out dates in October at the Sun
City Arena in Bophuthatswana, South Africa. On their return to
England, the band came under fire for having performed in South
Africa during apartheid and for violating global divestment efforts
and the UN cultural boycott. The band responded to the criticism by
stating that they were playing music for <font color="#2f4f4f">South
African </font>fans, and they also stressed that the concerts were

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After working on several solo
projects during 1988 (including Mercury's collaboration with
<font color="#a9a9a9">Montserrat Caballé, Barcelona), </font>the
band released The Miracle in <font color="#dcdcdc">1989.</font> The
album continued in the vein of A Kind of Magic, using a pop-rock
sound mixed with some heavy numbers. It spawned the European hits &quot;I
Want It All&quot;, &quot;Breakthru&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;,
&quot;Scandal&quot; and &quot;The Miracle&quot;. The Miracle also
began a change of direction in Queen's songwriting philosophy. Since
the band's inception, almost all songs had been written and
co-written by a single member, with minimal contributions from the
other members. <font color="#2f4f4f">With the release of The Miracle,
the </font>band's songwriting became more collaborative, and the band
vowed that the final product would be solely the work of Queen as a
band.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When fans noticed Mercury's
increasingly thin appearance in 1988, rumours began to spread that he
was suffering from AIDS. Mercury vehemently denied this, claiming he
was just &quot;exhausted&quot; and too busy to give interviews. The
band decided to continue making albums, starting with The Miracle in
1989 and continuing with <font color="#a9a9a9">Innuendo </font>in
1991. Despite his declining health, the singer continued to
participate. On the last two albums, which were made while Mercury
was still alive, the band wrote all the songs for Queen rather than
for specific band members, which freed the band from internal
conflicts and disagreements. In 1990, Queen terminated its contract
with Capitol and signed a deal <font color="#2f4f4f">with Disney's
Hollywood Records</font>, which has since retained ownership of the
band's music catalogue in the US and Canada. In the same year,
Mercury made his last public appearance, when he and other members of
Queen accepted the Brit Award for outstanding contribution to British
music.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Innuendo was released in early 1991,
and became a number 1 UK hit of the same name, and other
chart-toppers such as &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">The Show Must Go
On&quot;</font>. Mercury was increasingly ill and barely able to walk
when the band recorded &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; in 1990. As a
result, May was concerned about whether he was physically able to
sing the song. Recalling Mercury's successful performance, May says:
&quot;He went in and killed it, completely ripped the song apart&quot;.
The rest of the band was ready to record when <font color="#dcdcdc">Mercury
</font>felt able to come into the studio for an hour or two at a
time. May says of Mercury: &quot;He just kept saying. 'Write me more.
Write me stuff. I just want to sing this and do that, and when I'm
gone you can finish it.' He wasn't really afraid of anything.&quot;
The band's second Greatest Hits compilation, <font color="#2f4f4f">Greatest

</font>His funeral on 27 November <font color="#556b2f">in Kensal

his family's Zoroastrian religion. &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was
re-released as a single shortly after Mercury's death, and &quot;These
Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; was its two A-sides. The music video
for &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;
</font>features Mercury's final scenes in front of the camera. The
single went to number one in the UK and stayed there for five weeks -
the only record to have been number one twice at Christmas, and the
only one to have been number one in four different years (1975, 1976,
1991 and 1992). The original proceeds from the single - around
£1,000,000 - were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Queen's last album to feature
Mercury, <font color="#a9a9a9">Made in Heaven</font>, was finally
released in 1995, four years after Mercury's death. It contained the
songs &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; and &quot;Heaven for
Everyone&quot;, among others, and was constructed from Mercury's last
recordings in 1991, material left over from their previous studio
albums, and material reworked by May, Taylor and Mercury from their
solo albums. The album also featured the song &quot;Mother Love&quot;,
Mercury's last vocal recording before his death, which he finished on
a drum machine, to which May, Taylor and Deacon later added an
instrumental track. After finishing the penultimate verse, Mercury
had told the band that he &quot;wasn't feeling very well&quot; and
said, &quot;I'll finish it when I come back, next time&quot;;
however, he never made it back to the studio, so May later recorded
the last verse of the song. Both recording sessions, before and after
Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio <font color="#dcdcdc">in
Montreux</font>, Switzerland. The album went straight to number one
in the UK and has sold <font color="#2f4f4f">20 million </font>copies
worldwide. On 25 November 1996, <font color="#556b2f">a</font> statue

May referred to the Beatles as &quot;our bible in the way they used
the studio and painted pictures and this wonderful instinctive use of
harmonies&quot;. In the early 1970s, Queen's music was described as
&quot;Led Zeppelin meets <font color="#6b8e23">Yes</font>&quot;

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Queen wrote music that drew
inspiration from many different styles of music, often tongue in
cheek. They have been associated with progressive rock, symphonic
rock, art rock, glam rock, hard rock, <font color="#a9a9a9">heavy
metal</font>, pop rock and psychedelic rock, among others. Queen has
also written songs inspired by different styles of music not usually
associated with rock bands, such as opera, music hall, folk, gospel,
ragtime and <font color="#dcdcdc">dance/disco</font>. Several Queen
songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as <font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;We
Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;</font>.
Similarly, the song &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Radio Ga Ga</font>&quot;
became a live favourite because it got &quot;the crowd clapping like

Special, which was </font>deliberately designed for feedback<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font>
Sonic experiments featured heavily in Queen's songs. Queen's music is
characterised by vocal harmonies, usually consisting of the voices of
May, Mercury and Taylor, best heard on the studio albums A Night at
the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the groundwork for
developing this sound can be attributed to their former producer <font color="#2f4f4f">Roy
Thomas Baker </font>and their engineer <font color="#556b2f">Mike
Stone</font>. In addition to vocal harmonies, Queen were also known
for multi-tracking their vocals to emulate the sound of a large choir
using overdubs. For example, according to Brian May, 'Bohemian
Rhapsody' has <font color="#6b8e23">over 180 </font>overdubs of
songs. The band's song structures have been compared to the Beach
Boys, but May said they were &quot;not a very big influence&quot;.</p>

reformed tradition of <font color="#a9a9a9">Protestantism with its
</font>roots in <font color="#dcdcdc">the British Isles</font>.
Presbyterian churches take their name from the Presbyterian Church's
form of government, which is governed by representative congregations
of elders. Many Reformed churches are organised in this way, but the
word 'Presbyterian' is often used with a capital letter only for
those churches which have their roots in the Scottish and English
churches which bore this name and in English political groups formed
during the English Civil War. <font color="#2f4f4f">Presbyterian
theology </font>typically emphasises <font color="#556b2f">the
sovereignty of God</font>, the authority of the Bible and the
necessity of grace through faith in Christ. <font color="#6b8e23">Presbyterian
</font>church government was secured in <font color="#a0522d">Scotland
</font>by the Acts of Union of 1707, which created the Kingdom of
<font color="#228b22">Great Britain</font>. In fact, most
Presbyterians found in England can trace Scottish connections, and
the Presbyterian denomination was also exported to North America,
mainly by Scottish and Scots-Irish immigrants. Scottish Presbyterian
denominations hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate
successors, although there is a wide range of theological views
within contemporary Presbyterianism. Local congregations of
Presbyterian churches are governed by sessions of (elders) from the
congregation, a conciliar approach which also occurs at other levels
of decision-making (presbytery, synod and assembly).</p>

</font>Most Reformed churches rooted in <font color="#556b2f">Scotland

to work together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of
other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed
Churches. Some Presbyterian churches have formed alliances with other
churches such as Congregationalists<font color="#6b8e23">, Lutherans,
Anglicans and Methodists. </font>Presbyterians in the United States

</font>history is part of the history of <font color="#dcdcdc">Christianity</font>,
but Presbyterianism as a distinct movement began during the
<font color="#2f4f4f">Protestant Reformation of the </font>1500s.
When the Catholic Church resisted the Reformers, several different
theological movements split from the church and gave rise to
different denominations. Presbyterianism was particularly influenced
by the French theologian <font color="#556b2f">John Calvin, who </font>is
credited with developing Reformed theology, and the Scotsman John
Knox, who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland, and brought his
teachings back to Scotland. The Presbyterian Church has its roots
mainly <font color="#6b8e23">in England and Scotland</font>. In
August <font color="#a0522d">1560, the Scottish </font>Parliament
adopted the Scottish Confession as the creed of the Kingdom of
Scotland. In December 1560, the <font color="#228b22">first Book of
Discipline </font>was published, outlining important doctrinal issues
but also setting out provisions for church government, including the
establishment of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed wardens,
later known as presbyteries.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Presbyterian churches do not usually
have <font color="#a9a9a9">saint statues </font>or the <font color="#dcdcdc">ornate
altar typical of a Roman Catholic church</font>. Instead, the church
has a &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">communion table&quot;, which is
</font>usually on the same level as the congregation. Between the
communion table and the &quot;<font color="#556b2f">chancel&quot;
</font>behind it may be a railing, which may contain a more ornate
altar-type table, a choir loft or choir stalls, a lectern, and a
clergy area. The altar is called the communion table and the altar
area is called <font color="#6b8e23">the </font>Chancel <font color="#a0522d">by
Presbyterians. In </font>a Presbyterian (Reformed) church, there may
be an altar rail either <font color="#228b22">on the communion table
</font>or on the table in the chancel. By using the &quot;empty&quot;
cross, or <font color="#191970">resurrection </font>cross,
Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and the fact that Christ is
not constantly dying, but died once and lives forever. Some
Presbyterian church buildings are often adorned with a cross with a
circle in the middle, the <font color="#8b0000">Celtic cross.</font>
This not only emphasises the resurrection, but also recognises the
historical aspects of Presbyterianism. The baptismal font is located
either at the entrance or near the baptismal font area. Presbyterian
architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. You can
also find decorative and ornate stained glass depicting scenes from
the Bible. Some Presbyterian churches also have decorative statues of
Christ or sculptures of the Last Supper behind the chancel. St Giles'
Cathedral ( Church Of Scotland- the mother church of the
Presbyterians) has a crucifix hanging next to one of the pulpits. The
image of Christ is a more pale image and more contemporary in design.</p>

<font color="#2f4f4f">Thomas Cartwright is regarded as </font>the
first Presbyterian in England. Cartwright's controversial lectures at
Cambridge University, in which he denounced the Episcopal hierarchy
of the Elizabethan Church, led to his removal from office by
Archbishop John Whitgift and his emigration. Between <font color="#6b8e23">1645
and 1648</font>, decrees passed by the Long Parliament established
Presbyterianism as the form of government of the Church of England.
Presbyterian government was established in London and Lancashire and
a few other places in England, although Presbyterian hostility to the
execution of Charles I and the establishment of the English
Republican Commonwealth meant that Parliament never implemented the
Presbyterian system in England. The restoration of the <font color="#a0522d">monarchy
</font>in 1660 brought the return of Episcopalian ecclesiastical
government to England (and briefly to Scotland), but the English
Presbyterian Church continued to be nonconformist outside the
established church. In <font color="#228b22">1719 </font>there was a
major split, the Salter's Hall controversy, in which the majority
sided with non-trinitarian views. Thomas Bradbury published several
sermons on the controversy, and in 1719 also a reply to the
reproaches made against the dissenting ministers who subscribed to
their belief in an eternal trinity. By <font color="#191970">the

establishment of a small denomination (Koryu-pa, <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">고려파</font>,
later The Koshin Presbyterian Church in Korea, Koshin <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">고신</font>)
in 1952. And in <font color="#dcdcdc">1953 </font>another schism

</font><font color="#2f4f4f">could not be tolerated </font>in the

Republic of Korea, Kijang, <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">기장</font>)
resigned. The last major schism concerned the question of <font color="#6b8e23">whether

two denominations, The Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap, <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">통합</font>)

Scotland, as well as congregations founded by John Dunmore Lang. Most
of these congregations merged between <font color="#556b2f">1859 and

belonged to another religion. Protestants are most numerous in small
villages in South and West Thuringia, while in the larger cities the
proportion of non-religious people is even higher (up to 88% in
Gera). Catholic areas include the Eichsfeld region in the north-west
and parts of the Rhön mountains around Geisa in the south-west. The
Protestant Church is rapidly declining in membership, while the
Catholic Church is somewhat more stable due to Catholic immigration
from Poland, southern Europe and western Germany. Other religions do
not play a significant role in Thuringia. Thuringia is home to only a

nucleus of the later Electorate of Saxony and the Kingdom of Saxony.
With the division of the Wettin family in 1485, Thuringia passed to

the region into several smaller states in accordance with the German
tradition of dividing the inheritance between the male heirs. These

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Thuringia's landscapes are quite
varied. In the <font color="#a9a9a9">far north are the </font>Harz
mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around
Nordhausen, whose main river is the Helme. In the north-west is the
Eichsfeld, a <font color="#dcdcdc">hilly and in places wooded area
</font>where the river Leine originates. The central and northern
part of Thuringia includes the Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and
flat area of 3000 km² around the Unstrut river, which is completely
surrounded by the following mountain ranges (from north-west to
clockwise): Dün, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffhäuser, Hohe Schrecke,
Schmücke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest,
Hörselberge and Hainich. Within the basin are the smaller chains of
hills Fahner Höhe and Heilinger Höhen. South of the Thuringia Basin
is the largest mountainous area in the Land, characterised by the
Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highlands in the
centre and the Fransmann Forest in the south-east. Most of this
mountain range is forested, and the <font color="#2f4f4f">Großer
Beerberg </font>(983 m) is the highest mountain in Thuringia. To the
south-west the forest is followed by the Werra valley, which
separates it from the Rhön mountains in the west and the Grabfeld
plain in the south. East Thuringia, commonly referred to as the
region east of the Saale and Loquitz valleys, is characterised by a
hilly landscape that rises slowly from flat in the north to
mountainous in the south. The <font color="#556b2f">Saale in the west
and the Weiße Elster in the east </font>are two major rivers that
flow from south to north and form densely populated valleys in this
area. Between them are the flat and wooded Holzland in the north, the
flat and fertile Orlasenke in <font color="#6b8e23">the centre </font>and
the hilly but largely unwooded Vogtland in the south. In the far east
(east of the Weiße Elster) lies the Osterland or Altenburger Land
along the Pleiße, a flat, fertile and densely populated agricultural
area.</p>

dating back <font color="#dcdcdc">to the industrialisation of the

reunification in <font color="#dcdcdc">1990 </font>led to the <font color="#2f4f4f">closure

medium-sized enterprises to dominate the industrial sector.
Well-known industrial centres include Jena (a global centre for
optical instruments, home to Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik, among
others) and <font color="#556b2f">Eisenach</font>, where BMW started
car production in the 1920s and where the Opel plant is located
today. The main industries today are mechanical engineering,
metalworking, vehicle manufacturing and the food industry. In

south-western Thuringia (e.g. Arnstadt, Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf) are
highly industrialised, while <font color="#6b8e23">the northern and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Mining was important in Thuringia
from the late Middle Ages onwards, especially in the mining towns of
the Thuringian forest, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">Schmalkalden,
Suhl and Ilmenau</font>. After the Industrial Revolution, the old
iron, copper and silver mines declined because <font color="#dcdcdc">competition
from imported metals was too fierce</font>. In the late 19th century,
on the other hand, new types of mining were introduced in Thuringia:
lignite mining began in the 1870s around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in
the east of the state, and around 1900 two potash mining districts
were established. These are the <font color="#2f4f4f">Südharzrevier
</font>in the north of the Land, west of Bischofferode and east of
Roßleben, with Sondershausen in the centre, and the Werrarevier on
the border with Hessen around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west.
Together they accounted for a significant part of world potash
production in the mid-20th century. <font color="#556b2f">After the
merger, the </font>Südharzrevier mine was abandoned and K+S took
over the Werrarevier mines. Between 1950 and 1990, <font color="#6b8e23">uranium
mining was </font><font color="#a0522d">also important to meet the
Soviet Union's need for this metal</font>. The mining centre was
located near Ronneburg Gera in East Thuringia, and the Wismut
company, which operated the mine, was directly controlled by the
Soviet Union.</p>

Berlin to Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hessen via Eisenach,
Göta, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting
the main cities in Thuringia. At the Hermsdorf junction it joins the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The German higher education system
has two types of academic institutions: universities and universities
of applied sciences (Fachhochschulen). The <font color="#a9a9a9">University
of Jena is </font>the largest of Thuringia's <font color="#dcdcdc">four
</font>universities, offering almost all disciplines. It was founded
in 1558 and today has 21 000 students. The second largest is the
Technische Universität Ilmenau, founded in 1894 with 7 000 students,
which offers many technical disciplines such as engineering and
mathematics. The University of Erfurt, founded in 1392, now has <font color="#2f4f4f">5
000 </font>students and focuses on the humanities and teacher
training. The <font color="#556b2f">Bauhaus University of Weimar,
with </font>4 000 students, is the smallest university in Thuringia,
specialising in creative disciplines such as architecture and arts.
Founded in <font color="#6b8e23">1860, </font>it became known as
Germany's leading art school in the interwar period, the Bauhaus.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Thuringia's first <font color="#a9a9a9">railways
</font>were built <font color="#dcdcdc">in the 1840s, and the </font>main
line network was completed around 1880. By 1920, several branch lines
had been built, and Thuringia had one of the densest rail networks in
the world before the Second World War, with some 2 500 km of track.
<font color="#2f4f4f">Between 1950 and 2000, </font>most of the
branch lines were dismantled, halving Thuringia's rail network
compared with 1940<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font> On the other hand,
most of the main lines were upgraded after 1990, which led to an
increase in travel speeds. The main railway lines today are the
Thuringia Railway, which connects Halle/Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt,
Göta and Eisenach to Frankfurt and Kassel, and the Saal Railway from
Halle/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former is
served every hour by an ICE/IC train from Dresden to Frankfurt, while
the latter is served every hour by an ICE train from Berlin to
Munich. <font color="#6b8e23">In </font><font color="#556b2f">2017, a
new high-speed line will open, </font>diverting long-distance traffic
from these mid-19th century lines. Both ICE routes will then use the
Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed line, while the Berlin-Munich route
will continue via the Nuremberg-Erfurt high-speed line. Only the
section of the Frankfurt-Dresden line west of Erfurt will remain in
service after 2017, with a speed increase to 200 km/h (currently 160
km/h). The Erfurt main railway station, which was completely rebuilt
for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new link between
the two ICE lines. The main regional railway lines in Thuringia are
the Neudietendorf-Ritschenhausen railway from Erfurt to Würzburg and
Meiningen, the <font color="#a0522d">Weimar-Gera railway </font>from
Erfurt to Chemnitz, the Sangerhausen-Erfurt railway from Erfurt to
Magdeburg, the Gotha-Leinefelde railway from Erfurt to Göttingen,
the Halle-Kassel railway from Halle via Nordhausen to Kassel and the
Leipzig-Hof railway from Leipzig via Altenburg to Zwickau and Hof.
Most regional and local lines run hourly, but some run only every two
hours.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In an ecosystem, <font color="#a9a9a9">predation
</font>is a <font color="#dcdcdc">biological interaction in which the
predator (organism being preyed upon) eats </font><font color="#2f4f4f">the
prey </font><font color="#dcdcdc">(organism being attacked)</font>.
Predators may kill their prey before eating it, but predation often
leads to the death of the prey and eventually <font color="#556b2f">to
the absorption of </font><font color="#6b8e23">prey tissues through
consumption. Thus</font>, predation is often, though not always,
carnivorous. Other categories of consumption include <font color="#228b22">herbivory
</font>(eating parts of<font color="#191970"> plants</font>),
fungivory (eating parts of fungi) and <font color="#8b0000">detritivory
</font>(eating dead organic material (detritus)). All these
consumption categories are covered by consumer-resource systems. It
can often be difficult to distinguish between different types of
feeding behaviour. For example, some <font color="#483d8b">parasite
species </font>prey on a host organism and lay eggs on it for their
offspring to eat as it continues to live in or on its rotting body
<font color="#3cb371">after it dies. The </font>key feature of
predation, however, is the <font color="#663399">direct impact of </font><font color="#bc8f8f">the
predator </font><font color="#008080">on the prey population</font>.
On the other hand, detritivores eat only the <font color="#bdb76b">dead
organic matter </font>resulting from the decomposition of <font color="#bdb76b">dead
</font>individuals <font color="#bdb76b">and </font>have <font color="#4682b4">no

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A true predator can generally be
identified as one that <font color="#a9a9a9">kills and eats </font><font color="#dcdcdc">another
living creature</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Other types of
predators </font><font color="#556b2f">harm their prey in some way</font><font color="#2f4f4f">,
but this predator kills it. </font>Predators may <font color="#6b8e23">actively
hunt </font>prey in pursuit or <font color="#a0522d">sit and wait for
</font><font color="#228b22">prey to approach within striking
distance, </font>like ambush predators. Some predators kill large
prey and dismember or <font color="#191970">chew it </font>before
eating it, such as a jaguar or human; others may eat their (usually
much smaller) prey whole, such as a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a
fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that
kill both <font color="#8b0000">large and small prey </font>because
of their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) can do
both, depending on the circumstances; one or the other may eat a
whole large insect but chop up a rabbit. Some predation involves <font color="#483d8b">a
poison </font>that overwhelms the prey animal before the predator
swallows the prey by killing it, as the box jellyfish does, or by
paralysing it, as seen in the behaviour of the pine cone. In some
cases, venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, promotes digestion
of the prey before the predator begins to eat. In other cases, the
prey may die in the predator's mouth or digestive tract. For example,
<font color="#3cb371">bottlenose whales </font>eat millions of
microscopic plankton at a time, and the prey decomposes well after it
enters the whale. Seed and egg predation are other forms of true
predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators
in this category do not have to eat the prey completely. For example,
some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some can eat
only part of an organism, as in <font color="#bc8f8f">grazing </font>(see
below), but still consistently cause its immediate death.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">It can sometimes be difficult to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Predators are often the prey of
another organism, and predators are often predators as well. While
blue tits prey on insects, they can also prey on cats and snakes, and
snakes can prey on hawks. One way to classify predators is by <font color="#dcdcdc">trophic
level</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Organisms that eat autotrophic</font>,
or <font color="#556b2f">trophic pyramid </font>producers, are called
herbivores or primary consumers, and <font color="#2f4f4f">organisms
</font>that eat <font color="#6b8e23">heterotrophic organisms</font>,
such as animals, are called secondary consumers. Secondary consumers
are a type of carnivore, but these carnivores are also eaten by third
consumers, eaten by fourth consumers, and so on. Since only a
fraction of the <font color="#a0522d">energy </font>is transferred to
the next level, this hierarchy of predation has to end somewhere, and
it very <font color="#228b22">rarely extends beyond </font><font color="#191970">five
or six levels</font>, and may only extend to three trophic levels
(for example, a lion preying on large herbivores such as wildebeest,
which in turn eat grasses). A predator at <font color="#8b0000">the
top of </font>any food chain (i.e. one that is not preyed upon by any
organism) is called <font color="#483d8b">a top predator.</font>
Examples include the whale, sea whale, anaconda, Komodo dragon,
tiger, lion, tiger shark, Nile crocodile and most eagles and owls -
and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears. An apex predator <font color="#3cb371">may
not remain an apex </font>predator in one environment if it is
introduced into another habitat, such as a dog among alligators, a
skunk among skunk-owl-immune great horned owls, or a loggerhead
turtle among jaguars; a predator species introduced into an area

gains</font>, but there is always an energy cost to hunting. When
hunger is not an issue, most predators will generally not attempt to
attack prey because the costs outweigh the benefits. For example, a

around it (while prey fish take advantage of the fact that top
predators are seemingly uninterested). Excess killing is an

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">It is difficult to see the impact of
predators on their prey species in the <font color="#a9a9a9">short
term</font>. However, if observed <font color="#dcdcdc">over a longer
period of time, it can be seen that the </font>population of the
predator rises and falls with the population of the prey in a cycle
similar to the <font color="#556b2f">boom and bust cycle of the
economy. </font>If a predator overpredicts its prey, the <font color="#6b8e23">prey
</font>population<font color="#6b8e23"> will decrease so that
predators have too little prey.</font> This causes the predator
population to decline, reducing the predation pressure on the prey
population. The decrease in predators allows the remaining small prey
population to slowly increase its population to somewhere near its
former abundance, allowing the predator population to increase due to
greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey
species down to a size that it cannot sustain the population in the
short term, it can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of
the prey species, but also the extinction of its own species, a
phenomenon known as <font color="#a0522d">co-extinction.</font> This
is a risk that conservationists face when predators that have not
evolved with the same or similar predators are introduced into prey
species. This possibility largely depends on how well and how quickly
the prey species can adapt to the introduced predator. This risk can
be avoided, for example, by the predator finding an alternative prey
species or by introducing an alternative prey species (which
ecologists and conservationists try to avoid whenever possible). An
alternative prey species would help to remove some of the predation
pressure on the original prey species and allow the population to
recover, but it would not guarantee that the original prey species
would be <font color="#228b22">able to recover, as the </font>original

the era by bickering, holding grudges both deep and petty, and

reputation by focusing on <font color="#6b8e23">characterisation and

this feature was appreciated by a new generation of older readers.

capitalise on the success of its superhero comics of the previous

expanding its comics portfolio. Marvel overtook rival DC Comics in

price and size of Marvel's November 1971 comics <font color="#191970">from
15 cents </font>per 36 pages to 25 cents per 52 pages. DC followed
suit, but the following month Marvel lowered the price of its comics
to 20 cents per 36 pages and offered a cheaper product at a greater
distributor discount.</p>

</font>Empire comprised the territories, colonies, protectorates,
mandates and other territories controlled or administered by the
United Kingdom. It originated from the overseas possessions and
trading posts established by England between the late 1500s and early

more than a century it was the most important world power. By <font color="#dcdcdc">1922</font>,
the British <font color="#dcdcdc">Empire</font> was ruled by some 458

000 000 </font>square metres (33 670 000 km2), almost a quarter of
the world's total surface area. As a result, it has a rich political,
legal, linguistic and cultural heritage. At the height of its power,
the British Empire was often referred to as 'the kingdom whose sun
never sets' because, due to the extent of its landmass, the sun
always shone on at least one of its territories.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The independence of thirteen North
American colonies in <font color="#a9a9a9">1783, </font>following <font color="#dcdcdc">the
American War of Independence, meant that </font>Britain lost some of
its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned
to Asia, Africa and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the
<font color="#2f4f4f">Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars </font>(1792-1815),
Britain became the most important maritime and imperial power of the
19th century (London was the largest city in the world from around
1830). As Britain's dominance was not won at sea, it was later
described as the Pax Britannica ('<font color="#556b2f">British
Peace</font>'), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world
(1815-1914), during which the British Empire became the global
hegemon and assumed the role of global policeman. In the early 19th
century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain, and by
the time of the <font color="#6b8e23">1851 </font>World's Fair, the
country was described as 'the workshop of the world'. The British
Empire expanded to include India, much of Africa and many other
regions around the world. As well as formally controlling its own
colonies, Britain also controlled much of the world's trade, which
meant that it effectively dominated the economies of many regions,
including Asia and Latin America. Domestic political attitudes
favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies, as well as the
gradual extension of voting rights. This century saw dramatic
population growth, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, which created
significant social and economic pressures. In search of new markets
and sources of raw materials, the conservative party led by Disraeli
embarked on an imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa and
elsewhere. Canada, Australia and New Zealand became self-governing
territories.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By the early 20th century, <font color="#a9a9a9">Germany
and the United States </font>were challenging Britain's economic
leadership. Military and economic tensions between Britain and
Germany were a major cause of the First World War, during which
Britain relied heavily on its empire. The conflict placed a huge
strain on Britain's military, economic and labour resources. Although
the British Empire reached its greatest territorial extent
immediately after the First World War, Britain was no longer the
world's most important industrial or military power. In World War II,
Imperial Japan occupied the British colonies in Southeast Asia.
Despite the ultimate victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to
Britain's prestige contributed to accelerating the decline of the
empire. <font color="#dcdcdc">India</font>, Britain's most valuable
and populous possession, gained independence as part of a wider
decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most
of the empire's territories. The handover of Hong Kong to China in
1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire. <font color="#2f4f4f">Fourteen

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">No further attempts were made to
establish English colonies in America until well into the reign of
Queen Elizabeth I, in the last decades of the 1500s. In the meantime,
<font color="#a9a9a9">the Protestant Reformation </font>had made
implacable enemies of England and Catholic Spain. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1562,
the </font>English crown encouraged privateers John Hawkins and
Francis Drake to launch slave raids against Spanish and Portuguese
ships <font color="#2f4f4f">off the West African coast </font>with
the aim of breaking into the Atlantic trading system. This attempt
was rebuffed, and later, as the wars between England and Spain
escalated, <font color="#556b2f">Elizabeth I gave </font>her blessing
to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in America and
against ships returning across the Atlantic laden with New World
treasures. At the same time, influential writers such as Richard
Hakluyt and <font color="#6b8e23">John Dee </font>(who first used the
term 'British Empire') began to push for England to establish its own
empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the
Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean, Portugal had
established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and
Brazil to China, and France had begun to colonise the Saint Lawrence
River region, which later became New France.</p>

Now that England had made peace with its main rival, its attention
shifted from exploiting other countries' colonial infrastructures to
establishing its own overseas colonies. The British Empire began to
take shape in the early 1600s with the establishment of English
colonies and private companies to manage overseas trade in North
America and the small islands of the Caribbean, the most important of
which was the English East India Company. Some historians have
subsequently referred to this period as the <font color="#6b8e23">'first

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Caribbean initially offered the
most important and lucrative colonies for England, but it was not
until several attempts at colonisation failed that they were
successful. The attempt to establish a colony in French Guiana in
<font color="#a9a9a9">1604 </font>lasted only two years, and its main
objective was not to <font color="#dcdcdc">find gold deposits</font>.
The colonies of St Lucia (<font color="#2f4f4f">1605</font>) and
Grenada (1609) also failed quickly, but colonies were successfully
established in St Kitts (1624), Barbados (1627) and Nevis (1628). The
colonies soon adopted the sugar plantation system successfully used
by the Portuguese in Brazil, based on slave labour and - initially -
Dutch ships to sell the slaves and buy the sugar. To ensure that the
increasing profits from this trade remained in English hands,
Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships could trade in the
English colonies. This led to hostilities with the united provinces
of the Netherlands - a series of Anglo-Dutch wars - which ultimately
strengthened England's position in America at the expense of the
Dutch. In <font color="#556b2f">1655, </font>England annexed the

</font>under the leadership of <font color="#2f4f4f">Captain John

settled in Bermuda and took possession of it after the Virginia
Company's flagship was shipwrecked there in 1609, and in <font color="#556b2f">1615
</font>Bermuda was ceded to the newly formed Somers Isles Company.
The charter of the Virginia Company was revoked in 1624 and the Crown
took direct control of Virginia, establishing the Virginia Colony.
The London and Bristol Company was formed in 1610 with the intention
of establishing a permanent settlement in Newfoundland, but it
largely failed. In 1620, Plymouth was founded as a refuge for Puritan
religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims. Escape from
religious persecution became a motive for many future English
settlers to risk the arduous transatlantic journey: Maryland was
established as a refuge for Roman Catholics (1634), Rhode Island
(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions, and Connecticut (1639)
for Congregationalists. The province of Carolina was created in 1663.
After the surrender of the Amsterdam fortress in 1664, England took
over the Dutch colony of New Netherland and renamed it <font color="#6b8e23">New
York.</font> This was formalised in the negotiations following the
Second Anglo-Dutch War in exchange for Surinam. William Penn
established the colony of Pennsylvania in 1681. The American colonies
were not as economically successful as the Caribbean colonies, but
they had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted many
more English settlers who liked their temperate climate.</p>

1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in 13 colonies from 10% to 40% over
the same period (most of them in the southern colonies). For slave
traders, the slave trade was highly profitable and became a major
economic mainstay for western British cities such as <font color="#556b2f">Bristol

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 16th century, England
and the Netherlands began to challenge the Portuguese monopoly on
Asian trade and set up private limited companies to finance the
voyages - the English (later British) East India Company and the
Dutch East India Company, founded in <font color="#a9a9a9">1600 </font>and
<font color="#dcdcdc">1602 </font>respectively. The primary objective
of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, and
this effort was directed mainly at two regions: the East Indies
archipelago and India, an important hub in the trading network. There
they competed with Portugal and each other for commercial supremacy.
Although England eventually supplanted the Netherlands as a colonial
power, in the short term the Netherlands' more sophisticated
financial system and the <font color="#2f4f4f">three </font>Anglo-Dutch
wars of the 17th century left it in a stronger position in Asia.
Hostilities ended after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when the
Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne and brought peace
between the Netherlands and England. A treaty between the two
countries left the East India Archipelago spice trade to the
Netherlands and the Indian textile industry to England, but textiles
soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by <font color="#6b8e23">1720

British troops remained in Egypt until a <font color="#2f4f4f">treaty

British mandate since 1920, also became a member of the League after
gaining independence from Britain in <font color="#556b2f">1932</font>.
In Palestine, Britain's role was to mediate between Arab and Jewish
communities. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, which was incorporated
into the terms of the Mandate, stated that a national home for Jews
would be established in Palestine and that Jewish immigration would
be permitted up to a limit imposed by coercive power. This led to
growing conflicts with the Arab population, which openly rebelled in
1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased in the 1930s,
Britain prioritised support for the Arab population in the Middle
East over the establishment of a Jewish homeland and shifted to a
pro-Arab stance, which restricted Jewish immigration and in turn

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although Britain and the Empire
emerged victorious from the Second World War, the impact of the
conflict was profound both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a
continent that had ruled the world for several centuries, was in
ruins and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet
Union, which now held the global balance of power. Britain was
effectively bankrupt, and default was only avoided in 1946 when the
United States negotiated a loan of <font color="#dcdcdc">USD 4.33
billion </font>(USD 56 billion in 2012), the last instalment of which
was repaid <font color="#2f4f4f">in 2006</font>. At the same time,
the anti-colonial movement in the European colonies was on the rise.
The situation was further complicated by the intensifying competition
between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both nations
were opposed in principle to European colonialism. In practice,
however, American anti-communism won out over anti-imperialism, and
the United States therefore supported the continued existence of the
British Empire in order to contain communist expansion. The winds of
change eventually meant that the days of the British Empire were
numbered, and in general Britain adopted a policy of peaceful
secession from its colonies as soon as stable, non-communist
governments were available to whom power could be transferred. This
was in contrast to other major European powers, such as France and
Portugal, who fought costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep
their empires intact. Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people
under British rule outside Britain fell <font color="#6b8e23">from

Congress and the Muslim League - had </font>been campaigning for
independence for decades, but disagreed on how it should be achieved.
The Congress favoured a unitary secular Indian state, while the
League, fearing Hindu-majority domination, wanted a separate Islamic
state for Muslim-majority areas. Increasing civil unrest and the 1946
revolt of the Royal Indian Navy led Attlee to promise independence by
1948. As the urgency of the situation and the threat of civil war
became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy Lord
Mountbatten hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The
British-drawn borders, which divided India broadly into Hindu and
Muslim areas, left tens of millions of people as minorities in the
newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Subsequently,
millions of Muslims migrated from India <font color="#556b2f">to
Pakistan </font>and Hindus vice versa, and the violence between the

liverworts and hornworts. Pteridophytic vascular plants, which have
true kyleema and vasculature and reproduce by spores that germinate
freely into living gametophytes, evolved in the Silurian period and
diversified into several lineages during the Late Silurian and Early
Devonian. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the
present day. By the end of the Devonian period, several groups, such
as lycopods, fungophylls and progymnosperms, had evolved
independently into 'megaspores' - their spores were two groups of
different sizes, larger megaspores and smaller microspores. Their
tiny gametophytes developed from megaspores that remained in the
spore-producing organs (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, known as
endospores. Seeds consist of an endospore megasporangium surrounded
by <font color="#dcdcdc">one or two sheath layers </font>(integuments).
A young sporophyte develops inside the seed, which <font color="#2f4f4f">divides
and is released </font>at germination. The earliest known seed plants
are from the latest Famennian stage of the Devonian. After the

diversified and gave rise to several now extinct groups, such as
seedling plants and the modern godfoot and angiosperms. Modern
representatives include conifers, cycads, Ginkgo and Gnetales.
Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a carpel or
ovary. Ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The hypothesis that plant growth and

the movements of plant shoots </font>and roots towards light and

that the tip of the ciliary body ... acts like <font color="#2f4f4f">the
brain of the lower animals </font>... which controls the various
movements&quot;. Around the same time, Dutch scientist Frits Went
first outlined the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in
controlling plant growth. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid
(IAA), which <font color="#556b2f">promotes cell growth, was </font>not
isolated from plants until about 50 years later. This compound
mediates the tropical responses of shoots and roots to light and
gravity. In 1939 it was discovered that plant callus could be
maintained in IAA-containing cultures, and in 1947 it was found that
it could be induced to <font color="#6b8e23">form roots and shoots </font>by
adjusting growth hormone concentrations. This was a key step in the

hormones named <font color="#a9a9a9">after the control of cell

natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in maize (Zea mays) and is a
derivative of purine adenine. Zeatin is produced <font color="#2f4f4f">in
roots </font>and transported to shoots in the xylem, where it
promotes cell division, bud development and chloroplast greening.
<font color="#556b2f">Gibberellins</font>, such as gibberellic acid,
are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl-CoA via the mevalonate
pathway. They are involved in promoting seed germination and breaking
dormancy, regulating plant length by controlling stem elongation and
controlling flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) is present in all land
plants except liverwort and is synthesised from carotenoids in the
chloroplast and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes
seed maturation and dormancy and promotes stomatal closure. It is so
named because it was originally thought to control abscission.
Ethylene is a gaseous hormone produced in all higher plant tissues
from methionine. It, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon,
which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, is used on an

classes, such as genera or species. Biological classification is a
form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy has its roots in the
work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species <font color="#a9a9a9">according
to common physical characteristics. </font>These groupings have since
been revised to better reflect the Darwinian principle of common
descent - grouping organisms <font color="#dcdcdc">according to
ancestry rather than superficial characteristics</font>. Although
scientists do not always agree on how organisms should be classified,
molecular phylogenetics, which uses <font color="#2f4f4f">DNA
sequences </font>as data, has led to many recent revisions in line
with evolution, and this is likely to continue. The prevailing
classification system is called the Castle taxonomy. It includes
classifications and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of
botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of
Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and is administered
by <font color="#556b2f">the International Botanical Congress.</font></p>

Phylogenetic studies aim to find phylogenies. The basic approach is
to use similarities based on <font color="#dcdcdc">common ancestry </font>to
determine relationships. For example, Pereskia species are trees or
shrubs with protruding leaves. They obviously do not resemble a
typical leafless cactus such as an echinocactus. However, both the
genera Pereskia and Echinocactus have <font color="#2f4f4f">spines
consisting of areoles </font>(highly specialised <font color="#556b2f">cushion-like

Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded stems adapted for water
retention that resemble spherical cacti, but features such as their
flower structure make it clear that the two groups are not closely
related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to
characters, distinguishing between characters that do not contain
information about a common evolutionary history - such as characters
that evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or that are
left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) - and derived characters
that are inherited from innovations of a common ancestor
(apomorphies). Only <font color="#2f4f4f">derived characters</font>,
such as the areoles that produce the spine of cacti, provide evidence

1990s, the </font>construction of phylogenetics in living plants has

be plants or more closely related to plants than to animals.

disco artist Patrick Hernandez on his world tour in <font color="#a9a9a9">1979</font>,
she became romantically involved with musician <font color="#dcdcdc">Dan
Gilroy</font>. Together they formed their first rock band, the
<font color="#2f4f4f">Breakfast Club, </font>in which Madonna sang
and played drums and guitar. In <font color="#556b2f">1980 or 1981
</font>she left the Breakfast Club and formed the band Emmy with her

many Catholic symbols, such as stigmata and the burning of the cross,
as well as a dream of making love to a saint, which led to the video
being condemned by the Vatican. Religious groups sought to ban the ad

with David Letterman, used a censorship slur on television and handed
Letterman <font color="#556b2f">her panties </font>and asked him to
sniff them. The release of sexually explicit films, albums and books,
as well as an aggressive appearance on Letterman, led critics to
question Madonna <font color="#6b8e23">as a sexual renegade</font>.
Critics and fans reacted negatively, commenting that &quot;she had
gone too far&quot; and that her career was over.</p>

With her sixth studio album <font color="#2f4f4f">Bedtime Stories
</font>(1994), Madonna used a softer image in an attempt to improve
public perception. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard
200 chart and produced four singles, including &quot;Secret&quot; and
&quot;Take a Bow&quot;, the latter of which spent <font color="#556b2f">seven
weeks at </font>the top of the Hot 100, the longest of any of
Madonna's singles. Meanwhile, Madonna was romantically involved with
fitness coach <font color="#6b8e23">Carlos Leon.</font> The ballad

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the film Evita (1996), Madonna
played the title role of <font color="#a9a9a9">Eva Perón</font>.
Madonna had long wanted to play Perón and wrote to director <font color="#dcdcdc">Alan
Parker </font>to explain why she would be perfect for the role. She
later said, &quot;This is the role I was born to play. I put
everything about me into this because it was much more than a role in
a film. It was exhilarating and scary at the same time...... And I'm
prouder of Evita than anything else I've done.&quot; After getting
the role, she attended <font color="#2f4f4f">a singing school </font>and
learned about Argentina and Perón's history. <font color="#556b2f">During
filming, </font>she fell ill several times due to the intense mental
strain required<font color="#556b2f">.</font> As she told Oprah,
however, she was also pregnant during filming. I had to lie on the
couch every ten minutes to recover from the dizziness, and I was
worried that I was shaking the baby too much and that it would harm
it in some way.&quot; Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the
time, &quot;Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness
helps me in the film. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her
life when she discovered she was sick.&quot;</p>

critical acclaim. <font color="#a9a9a9">Zach Conner </font>of Time
magazine comments: &quot;It's easy to say that Evita is damn fine,
well-cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our
expectations. She plays Evita with a touching weariness, and there's
more than a little star quality to her. Love or hate Madonna-Eve, she
is a magnet for all eyes.&quot; Madonna won the <font color="#dcdcdc">Golden
Globe Award </font>for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or
Comedy for her role. She released three singles from the Evita
soundtrack album, including &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; (which won
the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1997) and &quot;Don't Cry for Me
Argentina&quot;. Later, Madonna received the Artist Achievement Award
from Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On <font color="#2f4f4f">14
October </font>1996, Madonna and <font color="#556b2f">Lourdes Maria
Ciccone Leon </font>gave birth to their daughter <font color="#556b2f">Lourdes
Maria Ciccone Leon.</font> Biographer Mary Cross writes that although
Madonna was often ill during filming and feared that her pregnancy
would interfere with the film, she achieved important personal goals.
&quot;Now 38 years old, Madonna had finally triumphed on the silver
screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same
year. She had reached another turning point in her career, and she
had reinvented herself and her public image.&quot; Her relationship
with Carlos Leon ended <font color="#6b8e23">in May 1997</font>;
Madonna announced that they were &quot;better off being best
friends&quot;. After the birth of Lourdes, Madonna immersed herself
in oriental mysticism and Kabbalah. She was introduced to Jewish
mysticism by actress Sandra Bernhard in 1997.</p>

change in her image. She collaborated with electronic music producer
<font color="#2f4f4f">William Orbit </font>to create a sound that
blended dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic
Ann Powers explained that what Madonna was looking for with Orbit
&quot;was a kind of lushness that she wanted on this record. <font color="#556b2f">Techno
and rave </font>was happening in the '90s, and it had a lot of
different forms. There was very experimental, harder stuff, like
Aphex Twin. There was also party stuff like Fatboy Slim. Madonna
didn't want that on this record. She wanted something more like a
singer-songwriter. And William Orbit gave her that.&quot;</p>

collaboration with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï: &quot;I love
working with weird people that nobody knows about - people with raw
talent who make music differently to anyone else. Music is the future
of sound.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that &quot;music
is whizzing by in a kaleidoscopic rush of colour, technique, style

self-aware and serious as Ray of Light.&quot; The album reached
number one in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold <font color="#6b8e23">four

Larry Flick of The Advocate magazine thought that &quot;American Life
is an album that ranks among his most adventurous and lyrically

half-hearted attempt to sound like and take him seriously&quot;. The
title track peaked at number <font color="#556b2f">37 on </font>the

thought that the video, which contained violence and war images,
would be considered unpatriotic because America was at war with Iraq
at the time. American Life, which sold <font color="#6b8e23">four

for a year before adoption, which Madonna did not do. She raised the
issue on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying that there are no written
adoption laws in Malawi to regulate foreign adoptions. She described
how Banda had been suffering from <font color="#2f4f4f">pneumonia

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since the beginning of 2014, Madonna
started to appear in several media. In January 2014, she appeared at
the <font color="#a9a9a9">56th Annual Grammy Awards</font>, where she
performed &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Open Your Heart</font>&quot;
together with rappers Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis and singer Mary
Lambert, who sang their single &quot;Same Love&quot;. 33 couples were
married on stage by Queen Latifah. Days later, she joined singer
<font color="#2f4f4f">Miley Cyrus </font>for her MTV Unplugged
special, singing a mash-up of the song &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and
Cyrus' single &quot;We Can't Stop&quot; (2013). She also expanded her
business ventures, and <font color="#556b2f">in February 2014, </font>the
singer launched the MDNA Skin skincare range in Tokyo, Japan. After
visiting her hometown of <font color="#6b8e23">Detroit in </font>May
2014, Madonna decided to donate funds to three organisations in the
city to help eradicate poverty there. The singer released a statement

Detroit recover&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Madonna also began work on her
thirteenth studio album, with collaborations from Avicii, Diplo and
Natalia Kills, among others. <font color="#a9a9a9">In December 2014,
</font>thirteen demos recorded for the album were leaked online. In
response, Madonna wrote that half of the tracks would not be used on
the final release, while the other half had &quot;changed and
evolved&quot;. The album, called <font color="#dcdcdc">Rebel Heart,
</font>was released on <font color="#2f4f4f">10 March 2015. </font>Starting
<font color="#556b2f">in September 2015, </font>she embarked on a
Rebel Heart tour to promote the album; the tour ended in March 2016
and toured North America, Europe and Asia, and was the singer's first
visit to Australia in 23 years, where she also made a one-off
appearance for her fans. The tour grossed <font color="#6b8e23">$169.8
million </font>from 82 shows, with over 1.045 million tickets sold.
During the tour, Madonna got into a legal battle with Ritchie over
custody of her son Rocco. The dispute started when Rocco decided to
continue living in England with Ritchie after the Rebel Heart tour,
while Madonna wanted him to return with her. Court hearings were held
in both New York and London, and after several negotiations Madonna
decided to withdraw her custody application, pleading that she and
Ritchie should discuss Rocco together.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Madonna's
</font>music has been much analysed and studied. <font color="#dcdcdc">Robert
M. Grant</font>, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005),
comments that Madonna's success has &quot;certainly not been the
result of exceptional natural talent. As a singer, musician, dancer,
songwriter or actor, Madonna's talents seem modest&quot;. He argues
that Madonna's success is a reliance on the talents of others and
that her personal relationships have served as the cornerstone for
numerous reinventions over the longevity of her career. Madonna's
approach was a far cry from the music industry wisdom of &quot;find a
winning formula and stick with it&quot;. Her musical career has been
a constant experimentation with new musical ideas and new
imaginations, and a constant quest for new heights of fame and
recognition. Grant concluded that &quot;having established herself as
the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued
to reinvent herself&quot;. Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that
&quot;Madonna's art itself repeatedly dismantles the traditional
notion of the unified subject with limited ego boundaries. Her works
explore different ways of forming identities that refuse stability,
remain unchanging and resist definition.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Throughout her career, <font color="#a9a9a9">Madonna
</font>has co-written and produced most of her own music. Madonna's
early songwriting skills were developed during her time with the
Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her
first attempts at songwriting are seen as an important
self-revelation, because Madonna said so: &quot;I don't know where
[the songs] came from. It was like magic. I wrote a song every day. I
said: 'Wow, I was meant to do this'.&quot; Her first producer <font color="#dcdcdc">Mark
Kamins </font>believed Madonna was &quot;a much underrated musician
and lyricist&quot;. Rolling Stone called her &quot;an exemplary
songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics&quot;.
According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's ability to develop
&quot;incredible&quot; hooks in her songs allows her lyrics to
capture the public's attention even without the influence of the
music. For example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single &quot;Into the
Groove&quot; and its line &quot;Live out your fantasy here with me,
just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now
I know you're mine&quot;. <font color="#2f4f4f">Madonna's </font>songs
over the years have often been autobiographical, exploring themes
ranging from love and relationships to self-respect and female
empowerment. Her songs also address taboo and unconventional topics
of the time, such as sexuality and AIDS in Erotica (1992). Many of
her lyrics contain innuendos and ambiguities that lead to a variety
of interpretations by music critics and scholars. Madonna has been
nominated for induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame twice, at
the <font color="#556b2f">2014 and 2016 </font>ceremonies. <font color="#6b8e23">Rolling
Stone </font>ranked Madonna number 56 on its &quot;100 Greatest

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Before Madonna became a pop star,
she spent her early years in <font color="#a9a9a9">rock music
</font>alongside her bands Breakfast Club and Emmy. While performing
with Emmy, Madonna recorded around <font color="#dcdcdc">12-14 </font>songs
that are reminiscent of the punk rock of the time. Her early rock
roots can also be found on the demo album Pre-Madonna. Stephen Thomas
Erlewine noted that with her debut album of the same name, Madonna
began her career as a disco diva in an era that had no such divas. In
the early 80s, disco was the antithesis of mainstream pop, and
according to Erlewine, <font color="#2f4f4f">Madonna </font>played a
huge role in popularising dance music as mainstream music. The songs
on the album reveal several key trends that have continued to define
her success, including a strong dance-based grammar, catchy hooks,
highly polished arrangements and Madonna's own vocal style. Her
second album <font color="#556b2f">Like a Virgin </font>(1984)
anticipated many of the trends in her later work. It included
references to classical works (the pizzicato synth line that opens
the song 'Angel'), possible negative reactions from social groups
('Dress You Up' was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center)
and retro styles ('Shoo-Bee-Doo', Madonna's tribute to Motown).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">His mature artistic stance was
reflected in <font color="#a9a9a9">True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer
(1989)</font>. In True Blue, he incorporated <font color="#dcdcdc">classical
</font>music to engage an older audience that had been sceptical of
his music. Like a Prayer featured live recordings of songs and
incorporated different styles of music, including dance, funk, R&amp;B
and gospel. His versatility was also evident in I'm Breathless, a
collection of jazz, swing and big band songs flavoured mainly with
1940s Broadway show tunes. Madonna continued to write ballads and
fast-paced dance songs for <font color="#2f4f4f">Erotica (1992) and
Bedtime Stories (1994)</font>. Both albums explored elements of new
jack swing, and Entertainment Weekly's Jim Farber noted that 'Madonna
could actually be considered the godmother of new jack swing'. He
tried to stay contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and
hip hop into his music. With Ray of Light, Madonna brought <font color="#556b2f">electronic
music </font>from its underground status to massive popularity in the
mainstream music scene.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Madonna experimented with <font color="#a9a9a9">folk

There was a noticeable change in the content of the Music songs: most
of them were <font color="#dcdcdc">simple love songs, </font>but with
a melancholy undertone. According to Q magazine, American Life was
characterised by 'a thumping techno rhythm, fluid keyboards, an
acoustic chorus and a quirky Madonna rap'. The album's &quot;conventional
rock songs&quot; are punctuated by dramatic lyrics about patriotism
and composition, including a gospel choir performance on &quot;Nothing
Fails&quot;. Madonna returned to pure <font color="#2f4f4f">dance
songs </font>with Confessions on a Dance Floor, which combined club
bits and retro music with lyrics about paradoxical metaphors and
references to her earlier works. Madonna moved in <font color="#556b2f">an
urban direction </font>with Hard Candy (2008), mixing R&amp;B and
hip-hop music with dance songs. MDNA (2012) focused largely on
<font color="#6b8e23">electronic dance music, which </font>she has

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Madonna has always been
self-conscious about her voice, especially when compared to her
singing ideals such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince and Chaka Khan<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Mark Bego, author of Madonna: <font color="#dcdcdc">Blonde
Ambition, </font>called her &quot;the perfect singer for lighter
songs&quot;, even though she is not a &quot;heavyweight talent&quot;.
<font color="#2f4f4f">According to </font>MSNBC critic <font color="#2f4f4f">Tony
Sclafani, </font>&quot;Madonna's singing voice is the key to her rock
roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs 'straight', but Madonna uses
subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal quirks in the
manner of John Lennon and Bob Dylan.&quot; Madonna used a bright,
girlish singing voice on her early albums, which became passable on
her later works. The change was deliberate, as Madonna was constantly
reminded of how critics had once labelled her 'Minnie Mouse on
helium'. During the <font color="#556b2f">filming of Evita, </font>Madonna
had to take singing lessons, which further increased her vocal range.
On this experience, she commented: &quot;I was studying for Evita
with a vocal coach and I realised there was a whole part of my voice
that I wasn't using. Before, I just believed that I had a really
limited vocal range and I was going to make the most of it.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In addition to singing, Madonna can
play several instruments. She learned to play <font color="#a9a9a9">drums
and guitar </font>from her then-boyfriend <font color="#dcdcdc">Dan
Gilroy </font>in the late 1970s before joining the Breakfast Club as
a drummer. This helped her form the band Emmy, where she performed as
a guitarist and singer. Later, Madonna played <font color="#2f4f4f">guitar
</font>on her demo recordings. Stephen Bray wrote in the liner notes
of Pre-Madonna: &quot;I always thought she missed out on a brilliant
career as a rhythm guitarist.&quot; After her career breakthrough,
Madonna concentrated mainly on singing, but she is also credited with
playing cowbell on Madonna (1983) and synthesizer on Like a Prayer
(1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied violin for <font color="#556b2f">three
months </font>for the role of a violin teacher in the film Music of
the Heart, but eventually abandoned the project. After two decades,
Madonna decided to perform again on guitar in the promotion of Music
(2000). She took more lessons <font color="#6b8e23">from </font>guitarist
<font color="#6b8e23">Monte Pittman </font>to improve her guitar
skills. Since then, Madonna has played guitar on every tour and on
her studio albums. At the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards, she
was nominated for the Les Paul Horizon Award, which honours the most
promising emerging guitarist.</p>

Taraborrelli, the </font>defining moment of Madonna's childhood was
the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother. Psychiatrist
<font color="#dcdcdc">Keith Ablow </font>suggests that her mother's
death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a
time when her personality was still being formed. According to Ablow,
the younger the child is when a serious loss occurs, the deeper the
impact and the longer it lasts. He concludes that &quot;some people
never adapt to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is no different&quot;.
In contrast, author <font color="#2f4f4f">Lucy O'Brien </font>believes
that the impact of the rape she experienced is actually a motivating
factor in everything Madonna has done, even more important than the
death of her mother: 'She is driven not so much by grief at her
mother's death as by a sense of abandonment that left her
unprotected. She faced her own worst-case scenario, being a victim of
male violence, and then turned it into her full-time job, reversing
the equation at every opportunity.&quot;</p>

her sister </font>grew older, they felt a deep sadness as the living
memory of their mother began to move away from them. They studied
pictures of her and began to think that she resembled the <font color="#2f4f4f">poet
Anne Sexton </font>and Hollywood actresses. This later increased
Madonna's interest in poetry, and <font color="#556b2f">Sylvia Plath
</font>was her favourite. Later Madonna commented: &quot;[Madonna's
death] wounded us all in one way or another, and then we spent the
rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to
become something else. The pain of losing my mother left me with a
certain loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I
hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so motivated. Her
death had a lot to do with the fact that I said - after I got over my
heartbreak - that I was going to be really strong if I didn't have my
mom. I'm going to take care of myself.&quot; Taraborrelli felt that
in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would
never again allow herself or even her daughter to feel as abandoned
as she had felt after her mother died. &quot;Her death had taught
[Madonna] the valuable lesson that she had to remain strong for her
own sake, because she feared weakness - especially her own - and
wanted to be queen of her own castle.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In her childhood, Madonna was
inspired by actresses and later said, &quot;I loved Carole Lombard,
Judy Holliday and <font color="#a9a9a9">Marilyn Monroe</font>. They
were all incredibly funny ... and I saw myself in them ... my
girlishness, my awareness and my innocence.&quot; Her &quot;Material

</font>appearance in the song &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best
Friend&quot; from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). He
studied 1930s screwball comedies, particularly Lombardi comedies, in
preparation for the film Who's That Girl. The video for the song
&quot;Express Yourself&quot; (1989) was inspired by Fritz Lang's
silent film <font color="#2f4f4f">Metropolis </font>(1927). The video
for the song &quot;Vogue&quot; imitated the style of Hollywood
glamour photographs, particularly those of Horst P. Horst, and the
poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard and Rita Hayworth, and the
lyrics referred to many of the stars who inspired her, including
Bette Davis, whom Madonna described as an idol. However, film critics
have been largely negative towards Madonna's film career. Time
magazine critic <font color="#556b2f">Stephanie Zacharek </font>said
that &quot;[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and
it's hard to watch because she's clearly trying her best&quot;.
According to biographer Andrew Morton, &quot;Madonna is bold in her
criticism, but in private she is deeply hurt&quot;. After the <font color="#6b8e23">Swept

and in 2004 she adopted the name Esther, which means &quot;star&quot;
in Persian<font color="#dcdcdc">.</font> She has donated millions of
dollars to schools in New York and London that teach the subject. She
faced opposition from rabbis who considered Madonna's adoption of
Kabbalah as sacrilegious and celebrity dilettantism. Madonna defended
her studies, saying: 'It would be less controversial if I had joined
the Nazi party', and that her participation in Kabbalah 'does not
harm anyone'. The influence of Kabbalah has since been noted in
Madonna's music, particularly on albums such as <font color="#2f4f4f">Ray
of Light </font>and Music. During the Re-Invention World Tour,
Madonna and her dancers wore T-shirts at one point in the show that
read &quot;Kabbalists do it better&quot;. Her 2012 album MDNA has
also been heavily influenced by her Catholic upbringing, and since

that Madonna had used MTV and music videos more than any other recent
pop artist to build her popularity and boost her recording efforts<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font>
They said that in many of her songs, the music video footage has a
strong context while referencing the music. Cultural critic Mark C.
Taylor, in his book Nots (1993), argued that the postmodern art form
par excellence is video, and the reigning 'queen of video' is
Madonna. He further argued that &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">MTV</font>'s
most significant creation is <font color="#2f4f4f">Madonna</font>.
Reactions to Madonna's overly provocative videos have been
predictably mixed.&quot; Media and public reactions to her most
controversial songs, such as &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, &quot;Like
a Prayer&quot; or &quot;Justify My Love&quot;, were more about the
music videos created to promote the songs and their impact than about
the songs themselves. Morton felt that 'artistically, Madonna's
songwriting is often overshadowed by her spectacular pop videos'.</p>

reflected her <font color="#a9a9a9">American and Latin American
street style </font>combined with flashy glamour. She was able to
convey her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to an <font color="#dcdcdc">American
audience</font>. The imagery and incorporation of Spanish culture and
Catholic symbolism in music videos continued in the music videos of
the True Blue period. Author Douglas Kellner noted that &quot;such
'multiculturalism' and his culturally transgressive moves proved to
be highly successful moves that endeared him to a large and diverse
youth audience&quot;. Madonna's <font color="#2f4f4f">Spanish look </font>in

</font>found that Madonna's videos subtly reversed the conventional
role of men as the dominant sex. This symbolism and imagery was
probably most dominant in the<font color="#dcdcdc"> &quot;Like a

African-American church choir, Madonna's retreat to a statue of a
black saint and singing in front of burning crosses. This mixture of
the sacred and the profane angered the Vatican and led to the
withdrawal of the Pepsi ad. In 2003, <font color="#556b2f">MTV </font>named

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The rise of Madonna occurred during
the advent of MTV; Chris Nelson of The New York Times spoke of pop
artists like Madonna, saying, &quot;MTV and its almost exclusively
lip-synced videos ushered in an era when fans of middlebrow music
could happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers who
simply uttered words.&quot; The symbiotic relationship between music
video and lip-sync led to a desire to transfer the spectacle and
imagery of the music video to live performances. He added: &quot;Artists
like <font color="#a9a9a9">Madonna and Janet Jackson </font>set new
standards for showmanship with their concerts, which included not
only elaborate costumes and precisely timed pyrotechnics, but also
<font color="#dcdcdc">highly athletic dancing</font>. These effects
came at the expense of live singing.&quot; The Dallas Morning News'
Thor Christensen commented that although <font color="#2f4f4f">Madonna
</font>gained notoriety for lip-synching during her 1990 Blond
Ambition World Tour, she has since rearranged her performances: &quot;She
mostly stays still during her most difficult vocal songs and [leaves]
the dance routines to her backing band ... [instead of trying to sing
and dance at the same time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">To help her move more while dancing
and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest <font color="#a9a9a9">users
of radio-frequency hands-free headphones. </font>The headphones were
attached to the top of the ears or head, and the microphone capsule
was on a boom that extended to the mouth. Because she wore the
microphone prominently, the design of the microphone became known as
<font color="#dcdcdc">the &quot;Madonna microphone&quot;.</font> Metz
noted that Madonna represents a paradox, as she is often seen as
living her life as a performance. While her screen performances are
criticised, her live performances are critical successes. <font color="#2f4f4f">Madonna
</font>was the first artist whose concert tours were re-enactments of
her music videos. Writer Elin Diamond explained that the reciprocal
effect of being able to recreate the images in Madonna's videos live
adds to the realism of the original videos. In this way, her live
performances have become a means of naturalising mediatised
representations. Taraborrelli said that <font color="#556b2f">Madonna's
</font>concerts and live performances, which incorporate multimedia,
state-of-the-art technology and sound systems, are seen as &quot;an

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Madonna has been hailed by many
music journalists, critical theorists and writers as the most
influential female artist of all time. Author Carol Clerk wrote that
&quot;during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star'
to become a global cultural icon&quot;. The Spanish magazine Rolling
Stone wrote that &quot;she became the first viral pop champion in
history, years before the internet became massively popular. <font color="#a9a9a9">Madonna
</font>was everywhere; on the covers of omnipotent music TV channels,
'radio charts', magazines and even in bookshops. The dialectic of
pop, the likes of which had not been seen since the Beatles' reign,
allowed her to stay on the frontiers of trend and commercialism.&quot;
<font color="#dcdcdc">Laura Barcella </font>in her book Madonna and
Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that &quot;indeed,
Madonna changed everything about the musical landscape, the look du

could (and could not) say, do or achieve in public.&quot; <font color="#2f4f4f">The

&quot;it's worth noting that before Madonna, most music megastars

of sexual imagery </font>has benefited her career and catalysed
public debate about sexuality and feminism. As Roger Chapman
documents in Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and
Voices, Volume 1 (2010), Madonna has often been condemned by
religious organizations, social conservatives, and parental rights
groups for her use of explicit, sexual imagery and lyrics, religious
symbolism, and otherwise &quot;disrespectful&quot; behavior in her
live performances. The Times wrote that she had &quot;started a
revolution among women in music ...&quot;. Her attitudes and opinions
on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to take
notice.&quot; Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of
empowerment Madonna provided was inextricably linked to the pleasure
of having some control over the meanings one attached to oneself,
one's sexuality and one's social relationships. In Doing Gender in
Media, Art and Culture (2009), the authors argue that Madonna, as a
female celebrity, performer and pop icon, has the capacity to subvert
persistent feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian
feminist Sheila Jeffreys, <font color="#dcdcdc">Madonna </font>represents
the occupation of the female in what Monique Wittig calls the
category of gender, the powerful, and seems to happily embrace the

is no federal common law. Although federal courts may create federal
common law in the form of case law, such law must be related in some
way to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional
provision, statute or regulation (itself enacted as part of or

The Constitution has expressly permitted the continuation of English

abandoned </font>the historicity of the patriarchs and the Exodus
narrative, recasting them as an inspiring national myth for the
Israelites. According to modern archaeology, the Israelites and their

- religion centred on <font color="#2f4f4f">Yahweh</font>, one of the

Yahweh-centred faith and the </font>various cultic practices
gradually gave rise to a distinct Israelite ethnic group, which
separated them from the other Canaanites. The Canaanites themselves

elements originate from within Judaism, others from the interaction
of Jews or particular Jewish communities with their environment,
others from social and cultural dynamics within the community, as
opposed to the religion itself. This phenomenon has led to a
remarkable variety of Jewish cultures, each unique within its own

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Other historians believe that the
number of conversions during the Roman period was small and did not
account for a large part of the increase in the Jewish population,
due to various factors, such as the fact that <font color="#a9a9a9">it
was illegal for men to convert </font><font color="#dcdcdc">to
Judaism </font><font color="#2f4f4f">in the Roman </font>world from
the mid-2nd century onwards. Another factor that would have made
conversion in the Roman world more difficult was the <font color="#556b2f">halakhic
insistence on circumcision, which was </font>quickly abandoned by
convert Christians. <font color="#a0522d">Fiscus Judaicus</font>, a
tax imposed on Jews in 70 AD, which was relaxed for non-Christians in
<font color="#228b22">96 AD. </font>, also limited the appeal of
Judaism. Moreover, historians argue that the very figure (4 million)
that was thought to represent the Jewish population in the ancient
Roman Empire is an error that has long since been disproved, and thus
the assumption that conversion contributed to the large-scale growth
of the Jewish population in ancient Rome is false. The figure of 8
million is also questionable, as it may refer to a census of the
total number of Roman citizens.</p>

</font>usually suggest that an old population, whose members diverged
and followed different migratory routes, has a small number of
founders. In most Jewish populations, these male ancestors appear to
have been <font color="#dcdcdc">mainly from the Middle East. </font>For
example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common patrilineal ancestry with
other <font color="#2f4f4f">Jewish and Middle Eastern groups </font>than
with non-Jewish populations in the areas where Jews lived in Eastern
Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with
Jewish traditions that place most of the patrilineal origins of Jews
in the <font color="#556b2f">Middle East. </font>In contrast, the
<font color="#6b8e23">maternal lineages of </font>Jewish populations
studied using mitochondrial DNA tend to be more heterogeneous.
<font color="#a0522d">Researchers such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael
Falk </font>believe this indicates that many Jewish men found new
spouses in European and other communities in places they migrated to
in diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. Behar, on the other hand,
has found evidence that about <font color="#228b22">40 per cent of
</font>Ashkenazi Jews are descended from the mothers of only four
female founders of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi
and Mizrahi Jews &quot;showed no evidence of a narrow founder
influence&quot;. Subsequent studies by Feder et al. confirmed <font color="#191970">the
high proportion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews.</font>
After reflecting on their findings on the maternal origin of
Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude, &quot;It is clear that the
differences between Jews and non-Jews are much greater than those
observed in Jewish communities. Thus, differences between Jewish
communities can be ignored when non-Jews are included in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Studies of <font color="#a9a9a9">autosomal
DNA</font>, which look at the whole DNA sequence, have become
increasingly important as technology has advanced. They show that
Jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related
groups in independent communities, with most community members
sharing a significant common ancestor. In the case of Diaspora Jewish
populations, the <font color="#dcdcdc">genetic composition of
Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews </font>indicates that the
majority of Jews are of Middle Eastern origin. According to Behar,
the simplest explanation for this common Middle Eastern ancestry is
that it is &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">consistent with the historical
formulation </font>that <font color="#2f4f4f">Jews are </font>descended
from the ancient Hebrew and Israelite inhabitants of the Levant&quot;

origin have varying degrees of admixture with non-Jewish historical
host populations in their maternal lines. For Ashkenazi and Sephardi
Jews (especially Moroccan Jews), who are closely related, the source
of non-Jewish admixture is predominantly Southern European, while
Mizrahi Jews show signs of admixture with other <font color="#556b2f">Middle

leaving within a few years. The peak of emigration from Egypt was in

only Arab country to experience a temporary increase in its Jewish
population during this period due to refugees from other Arab
countries, but by the mid-1970s the Lebanese Jewish community had

living in Muslim countries, the so-called <font color="#dcdcdc">dhimmis,
</font>were allowed to practise their religion and manage their

to pay the Islamic state <font color="#2f4f4f">a jizya </font>(a tax

and legal constraints, such as the <font color="#a0522d">prohibition
to bear arms </font>or to testify in court in matters concerning
Muslims. Many disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by
Bernard Lewis as 'most degrading' was the <font color="#191970">requirement
to wear a garment, </font>not found in the Koran or hadith, but
invented in early medieval Baghdad; observance of which was highly

certain Jewish communities in European-dominated North Africa) and
other minority groups in Europe by Germany and its collaborators
during the Second World War - remains the most significant
persecution of Jews in modern times. The persecution and genocide was
carried out in stages. Legislation to remove Jews from civil society
was passed <font color="#a0522d">years before the outbreak of the
Second World War</font>. Concentration camps were established, where
prisoners were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or
disease. As the Third Reich conquered new territories in Eastern
Europe, <font color="#228b22">special units called Einsatzgruppen
murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings.</font> Jews
and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds
of kilometres away on freight trains to extermination camps, where
most were killed in gas chambers if they survived the journey.
Virtually every branch of the German bureaucracy was involved in the
logistics of the massacres, making the country what one Holocaust
scholar has called a 'genocidal nation'.</p>
