<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Strasbourg (/ˈstræzbɜːrɡ/,
French pronunciation: [stʁaz.buʁ, stʁas.buʁ]; Alsatian:
Strossburi; German: <font color="#a9a9a9">Straßburg</font>,
[ˈʃtʁaːsbʊɐ̯k]) is the capital and largest city of the
Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine (ACAL) region in eastern France and
the official seat of the <font color="#dcdcdc">European </font>Parliament.
It is located near the German border and is the capital of the
Bas-Rhin department. The city and the Alsace region were historically
predominantly <font color="#2f4f4f">Alemannic, </font>hence the
city's <font color="#556b2f">Germanic </font>name. In 2013, the city
itself had 275 718 inhabitants, the Eurométropole de Strasbourg
(Greater Strasbourg<font color="#6b8e23">)</font> <font color="#a0522d">475
934 </font>inhabitants and the Strasbourg arrondissement 482 384
inhabitants. With <font color="#228b22">768 868 </font>inhabitants in
2012, the <font color="#191970">Strasbourg </font>metropolitan area
(the only part of the metropolitan area located in French territory)
is the ninth largest in France, accounting for 13% of the population
of the ACAL region. The Strasbourg-Ortenau supranational euro area
had <font color="#8b0000">915 000 </font>inhabitants in 2014.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Romans, under <font color="#a9a9a9">Nero
Claudius Drusus, </font>established a military outpost in the Roman
province of Germania Superior on the present site of Strasbourg and
named it Argentoratum. (This is why the city is commonly called
Argentoratum in medieval Latin.) The name &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Argentoratum&quot;
</font>was first mentioned in <font color="#2f4f4f">12 BC </font>and
the city celebrated its 2000th anniversary in 1988. &quot;Argentorate&quot;
as a toponym for the Gallic settlement preceded it before
Latinization, but it is not known for how long. The Roman camp was
destroyed <font color="#556b2f">by fire </font>and rebuilt <font color="#6b8e23">six
times </font>between the first and fifth centuries AD: in <font color="#a0522d">70</font>,
<font color="#228b22">97</font>, 235, <font color="#191970">355</font>,
the last quarter of the fourth century and the early years of the
fifth century. Argentoratum reached its largest and strongest form
under Trajan and after the fire of 97. From <font color="#8b0000">90
</font>onwards, Legio VIII Augusta was permanently stationed in the
Roman camp of Argentoratum. At that time it also included a cavalry
detachment, covering an area of about 20 hectares. Other Roman
legions temporarily stationed at Argentoratum were Legio XIV Gemina
and Legio XXI Rapax, the latter under Nero.</p>

</font>have also been found along the current Route des Romains, the
road to Argentoratum, in the suburb of Kœnigshoffen. It was here
that the largest burial sites were located, as well as the densest
concentration of civilian housing and shops next to the camp. Among
the most significant finds in Kœnigshoffen were fragments of the
great Mithraeum (discovered in 1911-12), which had been dismantled by
<font color="#2f4f4f">early Christians in the </font>fourth century.
From the 4th century onwards, Strasbourg was the seat of the
Bishopric of Strasbourg (which became the Archbishopric in <font color="#556b2f">1988</font>).
Archaeological excavations under the present Église Saint-Étienne

Their followers founded the Gymnasium, led by Johannes Sturm, which

the tetrapolitan confession and then the <font color="#556b2f">Augsburg
</font>Confession. Protestant icon-burning caused much destruction in
churches and monasteries, although Luther himself opposed the
practice. Strasbourg was the centre of humanist scholarship and early
printing in the Holy Roman Empire, and its intellectual and political
influence did much to establish Protestantism as an accepted religion
in south-western Germany (<font color="#6b8e23">John Calvin </font>spent
several years in the city as a political refugee). Sturm, a
<font color="#a0522d">Strasbourg </font>alderman, and Matthias, a

(1529), where their opposition led to the schism of the Catholic
Church and the development of Protestantism. Along with <font color="#228b22">four

long as Strasbourg remained independent, it would endanger the king's
newly annexed territories in Alsace, and that to defend these large
rural areas effectively, a garrison had to be stationed in towns like
Strasbourg. Strasbourg's bridge over the Rhine had been used
repeatedly by imperial troops (of the Holy Roman Empire), and during
the Franco-Dutch War Strasbourg had served <font color="#a9a9a9">three
times as </font>a gateway to imperial invasions of Alsace. <font color="#dcdcdc">In

President Woodrow Wilson's &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; without a

would have been in favour of France, as the political parties seeking
autonomous Alsace or accession to France won only a small proportion
of the votes in both the last general assembly and the local

The movement had its origins in the first elections to the Reichstag,
called 'les députés protestataires', and until the fall of Bismarck
in <font color="#556b2f">1890 </font>they were the only elected

its thriving economy. This may explain the difference between the
rural and Strasbourg vote. After the war, many Germans left
Strasbourg and returned to Germany; some were denounced by the locals

</font>1940, the first Alsatian resistance movement, La main noire
(The Black Hand), led by <font color="#dcdcdc">Marcel Weinum, </font>was
founded. It consisted of 25 young men aged between 14 and 18 who led
several attacks against the German occupiers. The action culminated
in an attack on <font color="#2f4f4f">Gauleiter Robert Wagner</font>,
the highest commander in Alsace, directly under Hitler's orders. In
March 1942, Marcel Weinum was indicted by the Gestapo and sentenced

die, I will die, but with a pure heart'. From 1943 onwards, <font color="#a0522d">Allied
planes </font>bombed the city. Although the city was not
significantly damaged by the First World War, Anglo-American bombing
caused extensive damage in attacks, at least one of which was alleged
to have been accidental. In August 1944, bombing damaged several
buildings in the old town, notably the Palais Rohan, the old customs
house (Ancienne Douane) and the cathedral. The 2nd <font color="#191970">French

they swore to continue fighting until the French flag flew over

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many Strasbourgers were recruited
against their will into the German army and sent to the Eastern
Front, and these young men and women were called <font color="#a9a9a9">Malgré-nous</font>.
Many tried to escape conscription, join the French Resistance or be
expelled from the Wehrmacht, but many could not because they risked
having their families sent to <font color="#dcdcdc">German </font>labour
or concentration camps. Many of these men, especially those who did
not respond to the call immediately, were pressured into 'voluntary'
service in the SS, often with direct threats against their families.
This threat forced most of them to remain in the German army. After
the war, the few who survived were often accused of being traitors or
collaborators, as this harsh situation was not known elsewhere in
France, and they faced the incomprehension of many. In July <font color="#2f4f4f">1944,
</font><font color="#556b2f">1,500 </font>Malgré women were released
from Soviet captivity and sent to <font color="#6b8e23">Algiers,

recognises the suffering of these people, and museums, public debates

its many hôtels particuliers (or palaces), the most impressive of

de l'Orangerie</font>, designed as <font color="#dcdcdc">a French
</font>garden by <font color="#2f4f4f">André le Nôtre </font>and
converted into an English garden by Joséphine de Beauharnais, which
today contains notable French gardens, a neoclassical castle and a
small zoo; <font color="#556b2f">Parc de la Citadelle</font>, built
around the impressive remains of a 17th century fortress near the
Rhine in Vauban; Parc de Pourtalès, built in the English style
around a baroque castle (extensively restored in the 19th century),
now a small three-star hotel, and home to an open-air museum of
international contemporary sculpture. The Jardin botanique de
l'Université de Strasbourg (Botanical Garden of the University of
Strasbourg) was established next to the Strasbourg Observatory, built
in <font color="#6b8e23">1881 under </font>German rule, and still
contains some of the glasshouses from that period<font color="#6b8e23">.
The </font><font color="#a0522d">Parc des Contades</font>, although
the oldest park in the city, was completely redesigned after the
Second World War. The futuristic Parc des Poteries is an example of a
European park concept from the late 1990s. The Jardin des deux Rives,
which straddles the Strasbourg-Kehl area on both sides of the Rhine,
opened in 2004 and is the largest park (60 hectares) in the
conurbation. The most recent park is the <font color="#228b22">Parc

Pards and poets. There is no conclusive evidence from archaeology as
to whether the events described in the Mahabharata have a historical
basis. The extant texts of these epics are believed to date from the
post-Vedic period, between about 400 BC and 400 AD. Some have even
attempted to date the events using archaeoastronomical methods which,
depending on which passages are chosen and how they are interpreted,
have produced estimated dates ranging from as late as the mid-2nd

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Kadamba (<font color="#a9a9a9">345 -
525 AD) was </font>an ancient royal dynasty of <font color="#dcdcdc">Karnataka,
India</font>, who ruled northern Karnataka and Konkan from Banavas in
what is now Uttara Kannada district. Under <font color="#2f4f4f">their
king Kakushtavarma, </font>the Kadambas of Banavas ruled over a large
part of the present state of Karnataka. <font color="#556b2f">Mayurasharma
</font>founded the dynasty in 345 AD and later showed that it could
develop to imperial proportions, as evidenced by the titles and
epithets assumed by its rulers. King Mayurasharma defeated the
Pallava armies of Kanchi, possibly with the help of some local
tribes. Kadamba's fame reached its peak under Kakusthavarma, a
notable ruler to whom even the kings of the <font color="#6b8e23">Gupta
dynasty</font> in northern India married. The Kadambas were
contemporaries of the western Ganga dynasty, and together they formed
the earliest indigenous kingdoms to rule the country with complete
independence. The dynasty later continued to rule as the feudal lord
of the larger Kannada kingdoms of Chalukya and Rashtrakuta for over
five hundred years, during which time it split into smaller dynasties
known as the Goan Kadambas, the Halasin Kadambas and the Hangal
Kadambas.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Chalukya Empire (Kannada:
<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯರು

large parts of <font color="#a9a9a9">south and </font>central India
<font color="#dcdcdc">between the 6th and 12th centuries</font>.
During this period they ruled as three related but separate
dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the 'Badami Chalukyas',
ruled from Vatap (present-day Badami) from the mid-6th century. The
Badami Chalukyas began to establish their independence with the
decline of the Kadamba Kingdom of Banavas and quickly rose to
prominence under Pulakesh II. The Chalukyas' reign is an important
milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the
history of Karnataka. The political climate of South India changed
from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the rise of the Badami
Chalukyas. The kingdom, which originated in South India, took over
and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and Narmada
rivers. The rise of this empire gave rise to efficient
administration, foreign trade and commerce, and a new style of
architecture known as <font color="#2f4f4f">Chalukya architecture.
</font>The Chalukya dynasty ruled parts of south and central India
from Badam in Karnataka from <font color="#556b2f">550-750 </font>and

</font>the Rashtrakuta kingdom ruled from its capital <font color="#dcdcdc">Manyakheta
for </font>almost two centuries. The Rashtrakuta Empire ruled at its
peak from the doab of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in the north to
Cape Comorin in the south. This was a fertile period of political
expansion, architectural achievements and famous literature. The
early kings of this dynasty were <font color="#2f4f4f">Hindu</font>,
but later kings were strongly influenced by <font color="#556b2f">Jainism.</font>
Govinda III and Amoghavarsha were among the most famous of the able
administrators produced by this dynasty. <font color="#6b8e23">Amoghavarsha,
</font>who ruled for 64 years, was also a writer and author of
Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada work on poetry.
Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest
example of which is the temple of Kailasanath at Ellora. Other
notable achievements include the carvings of the Elephanta Caves in
present-day Maharashtra, and the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain
Narayana temple of Pattadakal in present-day Karnataka, all of which
are UNESCO World Heritage sites. Suleiman, an Arab traveller,
described the Rashtrakuta kingdom as one of the four great kingdoms
of the world. The Rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the
golden age of mathematics in South India. The great South Indian
mathematician Mahāvīra (the mathematician) lived in the Rashtrakuta
kingdom, and his text had an enormous influence on the medieval South
Indian mathematicians who lived after him. The rulers of Rashtrakuta
also protected men of letters who wrote in a variety of languages,
from Sanskrit to Apabhraṃśa.</p>

'protector', as the end of their names. The empire reached its peak
during the Dharmapala and Devapala periods. Dharmapala is believed to
have conquered Kanauji and extended his kingdom to the
north-westernmost frontiers of India. The Pala Empire can be
considered the <font color="#556b2f">golden age of Bengal in </font>many
ways. Dharmapala founded Vikramashila and revived Nalanda, considered
one of the first great universities in recorded history. <font color="#6b8e23">Nalanda
</font>reached its zenith under the patronage of the Pala Empire. The
Palas also built many viharas. They maintained close cultural and
trade relations with the countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet.

prominence in the mid-9th century AD and founded the largest empire
in southern India. They successfully unified <font color="#a9a9a9">South
India </font>under their rule and, with the help of their naval
power, extended their influence to countries in Southeast Asia, such
as Srivijaya. Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra
Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola
I, the dynasty became a <font color="#dcdcdc">military, economic and

Chola I's naval forces went even further, occupying the sea coasts
from Burma to Vietnam, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the
Lakshadweep (Laccadive) Islands, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula in
Southeast Asia, and the Pegu Islands. Rajendra Chola I's expedition
on the Ganges and the conquest of the cities of the maritime kingdom
of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia, as well as repeated missions to
China, proclaimed the power of the new empire to the eastern world.
They dominated Sri Lankan political affairs for over two centuries
through repeated invasions and occupations. They also had continuous
trade links with the Arabs in the west and the Chinese empire in the
east. Rajaraja Chola I and his equally important son Rajendra Chola I
gave political unity to <font color="#2f4f4f">the whole of South

Deccan in South India between the <font color="#a9a9a9">10th and 12th

and the Kaveri River in the south came under the control of the
Chalukya. During this period, the other major ruling families of the
Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Devagiri Seuna Yadavas, the Kakatiya
dynasty and the southern Kalachuri, were subordinate to the western
Chalukyas and only became independent when the Chalukyas' power waned

developed an architectural style known today as the <font color="#dcdcdc">Transitional

temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna temple at Kuruvat, the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Like other established agricultural
societies in history, nomadic tribes have been attacked on the Indian
subcontinent throughout its long history. In assessing the impact of
Islam on the continent, it must be borne in mind that the
north-western part of the continent was often the target of raiding
tribes <font color="#a9a9a9">from Central Asia. </font>In this sense,
<font color="#dcdcdc">the Muslim incursions </font>and subsequent
Muslim attacks were no different from the earlier attacks during the
1st millennium. However, Muslim incursions and subsequent Muslim
invasions differed in that, unlike earlier conquerors who <font color="#2f4f4f">assimilated
into </font>the dominant social system, successful Muslim conquerors
retained <font color="#556b2f">their Islamic identity </font>and
created new legal and administrative systems, which challenged and
usually in many cases superseded existing social systems of behaviour
and ethics, and even largely affected non-Muslim competitors and
ordinary crowds, while leaving non-Muslim populations to their own
laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural rules, which in
some respects were very different from the existing cultural rules.
This led to the emergence of a new Indian culture, which was <font color="#6b8e23">mixed
in </font>nature, albeit different from the ancient Indian culture
and the later westernised modern Indian culture. At the same time, it
should be noted that the vast majority of Muslims in India are Indian
converts to Islam. This factor too played an important role in the
synthesis of cultures.</p>

</font>by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of the Sangama
dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as the culmination of efforts
by the southern powers to repel Islamic invasions in the late 13th
century. The empire is named after its capital Vijayanagara, whose
ruins surround the present-day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in
Karnataka, India. The legacy of the empire includes many monuments
spread across southern India, the most famous of which is the <font color="#dcdcdc">Hampi
</font>Group. The earlier temple-building traditions of southern
India merged with the Vijayanagara architectural style. The
intermingling of all religions and vernaculars inspired architectural
innovations in the construction of Hindu temples, first in the Deccan
area and later in the Dravidian idiom using local granite. South
Indian mathematics flourished under the auspices of the Vijayanagara
Empire in Kerala. <font color="#556b2f">In the 13th century, the
</font>South Indian mathematician <font color="#2f4f4f">Madhava of
Sangamagrama </font>founded the famous Kerala School of Astronomy and
Mathematics, which produced many great South Indian mathematicians in
medieval South India, including Parameshvara, Nilakantha Somayaji and
Jyeṣṭhadeva. Efficient administration and bustling foreign trade
brought with it new technologies, such as water supply systems for
irrigation. Thanks to the patronage of the empire, visual arts and
literature reached new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and
Sanskrit, and Carnatic music developed into its present form. The
Vijayanagara Empire created an era in South Indian history that
transcended regionalism by promoting <font color="#6b8e23">Hinduism
</font>as a unifying factor. The empire reached its peak during the
reign of Sri Krishnadevaraya, when Vijayanagara's armies were
consistently victorious. The empire annexed previously sultanate-held
areas in the northern Deccan and areas in the eastern Deccan,
including Kalinga, while retaining control of all its southern
subordinates. Many important monuments were either completed or
commissioned under Krishna Deva Raya. Vijayanagara fell into decline
after its defeat at the Battle of Talikota (1565).</p>

defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal. After his victory,
Nader conquered and sacked Delhi, taking with him many treasures,
including a peacock throne. The Mughal dynasty was reduced to puppet
rulers by 1757. The remnants of the Mughal dynasty were eventually

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">The Mughal
dynasty </font>was perhaps the richest single dynasty that ever
existed. During the Mughal era, the dominant political forces were
the Mughal Empire and its subjects, and later successor states - such
as the Maratha Empire - which fought against an increasingly weak
Mughal dynasty. Although the Mughal tactics were often brutal in
subjugating their empire, their politics were based on <font color="#dcdcdc">integration
into Indian culture, which </font>made them successful where Delhi's
short-lived sultanates had failed. This period marked a huge social
change on the continent, with the majority of Hindus being ruled by
Mughal emperors, most of whom showed religious tolerance and
supported Hindu culture. The famous <font color="#2f4f4f">Emperor
Akbar</font>, grandson of Babar, tried to establish good relations
with the Hindus. However, later emperors, such as <font color="#556b2f">Aurangazeb,
</font>tried to establish complete Muslim domination, resulting in
the destruction of several historic temples during this period and
the imposition of taxes on non-Muslims. Akbar proclaimed 'amar', or
not killing animals, on the holy days of Jainism. He withdrew the
jizya tax from non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors intermarried with
local royalty, allied themselves with local maharajas and sought to
combine Turko-Persian culture <font color="#6b8e23">with ancient
Indian </font>styles to create a unique Indo-Saracenic architecture.
The erosion of this tradition, combined with increased brutality and
centralisation, largely contributed to the downfall of the dynasty
after Aurangzeb, who, unlike previous emperors, imposed relatively
unpluralistic policies on the population, often inflaming the Hindu
majority.</p>

the rise of <font color="#a9a9a9">Maratha dominance </font>with the
emergence of other small regional states (mostly late Mughal
subjects) and also the increasing activity of European powers. There
is no doubt that the single most important power to emerge in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By the <font color="#a9a9a9">early
1700s, </font>the Maratha kingdom had become the Maratha kingdom,
ruled by the <font color="#dcdcdc">Peshwas </font>(<font color="#2f4f4f">chief
ministers)</font>. In 1737, the Marathas defeated the Mughal army in
their capital Delhi at the Battle of Delhi (1737). The Marathas
continued their military campaigns against the Mughals, Nizam, the
Nawab of Bengal and the Durran Empire to further expand their
frontiers. Gordon explained how the Marathas systematically took
control of new territories. They started with annual raids, then
collected ransoms from villages and towns while the declining Mughal
Empire maintained nominal control, and finally took over the region.
He explained it with the example of the Malwa region. The Marathas
built an efficient system of public administration known for its
attention to detail. It managed to raise revenues in districts that
had recovered from years of looting, even to levels previously
enjoyed by the Mughal administration. For example, the cornerstone of
the Maratha administration in Malwa was the 60 or so local tax
collectors who paid the Maratha ruler Peshwa a share of their
district's revenue in return for interest. By <font color="#556b2f">1760</font>,
the Maratha empire extended to virtually the entire continent<font color="#556b2f">.</font>
The north-western expansion of the Marathas came to a halt after the
Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, Maratha power in the north
was restored within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I. The defeat of
the Marathas by the <font color="#6b8e23">British in the </font>Third
Anglo-Maratha War ended the empire by 1820. The last Peshwa, Baji Rao
II, suffered defeat by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.
After the defeat of the Marathas, no indigenous power posed a
significant threat to the British.</p>

what is now Punjab. The kingdom, based around the Punjab region,

Ranjit Singh proved to be a master strategist and selected competent

Multan and Kashmir provinces, the Peshawar valley and Derajat. This
was in the face of a powerful British East India Company. At its
height in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass

Bengal was reunited in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the

Indian membership of provincial executive councils and the viceroy's
executive council. The Imperial Legislative Council was expanded from
25 to 60 members, and Muslims were given separate municipal
representation, a dramatic step towards representative and
accountable government. A number of socio-religious organisations
were created at this time. Muslims founded the Muslim League of India
in 1906. It was not a mass party but aimed at protecting the
interests of aristocratic Muslims. It was internally divided by
conflicting loyalties to Islam, the British and India, and distrust
of Hindus. The Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sought to represent Hindu interests, although

independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had arisen over the
years. Muslims had always been <font color="#a9a9a9">a minority </font>on
the continent, and the prospect of an exclusively Hindu government
made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to be
suspicious of <font color="#dcdcdc">Hindu rule </font>as they were to
oppose a foreign Raj, although Gandhi urged unity between the two
groups with an astonishing display of leadership. The British,
extremely weakened by the Second World War, promised to leave and
participated in the formation of <font color="#2f4f4f">a provisional
government</font>. The British Indian territories became independent
in 1947, after being divided into the Union of India and the Union of
Pakistan. Following the controversial partition of Punjab and Bengal
prior to partition, riots broke out in these provinces between Sikhs,
Hindus and Muslims, spreading to several other parts of India and
claiming some <font color="#556b2f">500 000 </font>lives. This period
also saw one of the largest mass migrations ever recorded in modern
history, with a total of <font color="#6b8e23">12 million </font>Hindus,
Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly independent states of
India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 August 1947 and

al-Hakim wrote that the Egyptian people only needed &quot;a man who
represents all their feelings and desires and who is a symbol of
their ambition&quot;. Nasser later cited the novel as the inspiration

Ibrahim Khairy Pasha, the Minister of War in charge of the academy's
selection committee, and asked him for help. <font color="#dcdcdc">Khairy
Pasha </font>agreed and supported Nasser's second application, which
was accepted at the end of 1937. From then on, Nasser concentrated on
his military career and had little contact with his family. At the
Academy, he met Abdel Hakim Amer and Anwar Sadat, both of whom became
important contributors during his presidency. After graduating from
the academy in July 1938, he was appointed an infantry lieutenant and
posted to Mankabad. It was here that Nasser and his closest comrades,
including <font color="#2f4f4f">Sadat and Amer</font>, first
discussed their dissatisfaction with <font color="#556b2f">the
widespread corruption in the </font>country and their desire to

Ambassador Miles Lampson </font>marched on King Farouk's palace and
ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha because of
his pro-Axis sympathies. Nasser considered the incident a flagrant
violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote: &quot;I am ashamed that
our army has not responded to this attack&quot;, and hoped
&quot;misfortune&quot; would strike the British. Later that year,
Nasser was admitted to the General Staff College. He began to form a
group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments
who advocated some form of revolution. Nasser kept in touch with the
members of the group, mainly through <font color="#6b8e23">Amer, </font>who
continued to search for interested officers in the various branches

6th Infantry Battalion</font>. During the war, he wrote of the
Egyptian army's lack of preparation, saying that &quot;our soldiers
ran into fortifications&quot;. Nasser was deputy commander of the
Egyptian forces that secured the Faluja pocket. On 12 July he was
<font color="#2f4f4f">lightly </font>wounded in the fighting. By
August, his brigade had been surrounded by the <font color="#556b2f">Israeli
</font>army. Calls for help from the Jordanian Arab Legion went
unanswered, but the brigade refused to surrender. Negotiations
between Israel and Egypt eventually led to the handover of the
<font color="#6b8e23">village </font>to Israel. According to veteran
journalist Eric Margolis, those who defended Faluja, &quot;including
the young army officer Gamal Abdel Nasser, became national heroes&quot;
because they withstood Israeli bombardment despite being isolated

The long-awaited revolution began on <font color="#2f4f4f">22 July
and </font>was declared successful the following day. The Free
Officers took over all government buildings, radio stations, police
stations and the army headquarters in Cairo. While many of the rebel
officers led their units, Nasser dressed in <font color="#556b2f">civilian
clothes </font>to avoid detection by the royals and moved around
Cairo to observe the situation. To avoid foreign intervention, two
days before the revolution, Nasser had informed the US and British
governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to help
Farouk. Under American pressure, Nasser had agreed to <font color="#6b8e23">expel

abolished and the Republic of Egypt was proclaimed, with <font color="#a9a9a9">Naguib
</font>becoming its first president. According to Aburish, Nasser and
the Free Officers expected to become the &quot;guardians of the
people's interests&quot; against the monarchy and the Pasha class,
leaving the day-to-day administration <font color="#dcdcdc">to
civilians. </font>They called on former Prime Minister <font color="#2f4f4f">Ali
Maher </font>to accept his reappointment to his former post and form
a fully civilian government. The Free Officers then led the
Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), chaired by Naguib and
vice-chaired by Nasser. However, relations between the RCC and Maher
became strained as Maher considered many of Nasser's plans - agrarian
reform, abolition of the monarchy and reorganisation of the political
parties - too radical, leading to Maher's resignation on 7 September.
Naguib took over as Prime Minister and Nasser as Deputy Prime
Minister. In September, the <font color="#6b8e23">law on agricultural
reform </font>came into force. In Nasser's view, this law gave the
RCC its own identity and turned the coup into a revolution.</p>

had held an official meeting without his presence two days earlier.
On 26 February, Nasser accepted the resignation, placed Naguib under
house arrest and the RCC declared Nasser both <font color="#dcdcdc">Chairman
and Prime Minister of the RCC</font>. In line with Nagu Naguib's
intentions, a revolt immediately broke out, demanding Naguib's
reinstatement and the dissolution of the RCC. Nasser visited the
striking officers at the General Headquarters of the Military Command
(GHQ) to demand an end to the rebellion, but was initially
intimidated into accepting their demands. On 27 February, however,
Nasser's supporters in the army attacked the headquarters and ended
the rebellion. Later that day, hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators, mainly from <font color="#2f4f4f">the Brotherhood,
demanded </font>the return of Naguib and the <font color="#556b2f">imprisonment

League and 'maintain [Arab] submission to Zionism and [Western]
imperialism'. Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt's regional
leadership, he had to acquire <font color="#dcdcdc">modern weapons </font>to
equip his army. When it became clear to him that the West would not
supply Egypt on acceptable economic and military terms, Nasser turned
to the Eastern Bloc and concluded an arms supply agreement with

that before 1956, Nasser had consolidated control of Egypt's military

of the canal that he gained almost complete public legitimacy and
established himself as a &quot;charismatic leader&quot; and
&quot;spokesman for the masses <font color="#2f4f4f">not only in
Egypt but throughout the Third World.</font>&quot; According to
Aburish, this was Nasser's greatest pan-Arab victory at the time, and
&quot;soon his pictures were seen in the tents of Yemen, in the souks
of Marrakesh and in the fine villas of Syria&quot;. The official
reason for the nationalisation was that the proceeds from the canal
would be used to build the Aswan dam. On the same day, Egypt closed
the canal to <font color="#556b2f">Israeli </font>shipping.</p>

United Kingdom, which </font>are the largest shareholders in the Suez
Canal Company, considered its nationalisation as another hostile move
by the Egyptian government against them. Nasser was aware that the
nationalisation of the canal would cause an international crisis, and
he considered military intervention by the two countries to be 80%
likely. However, he believed that the UK would not be able to
intervene militarily for at least two months after the announcement
and dismissed Israeli action as &quot;impossible&quot;. In early
October, <font color="#dcdcdc">the UN Security Council </font>met to
discuss the nationalisation of the canal and adopted a resolution
recognising Egypt's right to control the canal as long as it
continues to allow foreign ships to transit the canal. According to
Heikal, following this agreement, &quot;Nasser estimated that the
risk of an invasion had fallen to 10%&quot;. Shortly afterwards,

and advanced rapidly towards their objectives. Two days later,
British and French aircraft bombed <font color="#dcdcdc">Egyptian

activities of the country's civil service so that it did not become
bloated and become a burden on the state. The new laws offered
workers a minimum wage, profit-sharing, free education, free health
care, reduced working hours and incentives to participate in
management. Land reforms ensured security for tenant farmers,
promoted agricultural growth and reduced rural poverty. As a result
of the 1962 measures, state ownership of Egyptian companies rose to
<font color="#a9a9a9">51% and </font>the National Union was renamed
the Arab <font color="#dcdcdc">Socialist </font>Union (ASU). These

Qutb was indicted and found guilty by the court of Nasser's

From 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and the national debt became
increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to relax state control of the

state-owned banks to private companies and introduced incentives to
boost exports. In the 1960s, Egypt's economy went <font color="#6b8e23">from

Syria, although Chief of Staff Mohamed Fawzi considered the warnings
&quot;unfounded&quot;. According to Kandil, Amer used the Soviet
warnings as an excuse to <font color="#dcdcdc">send troops to the
Sinai Peninsula on </font>14 May without Nasser's permission, and
Nasser then demanded the withdrawal of the UNEF. Earlier that day,
Nasser had received a warning from King Hussein about an <font color="#2f4f4f">Israeli-US
</font>conspiracy to draw Egypt into war. Amer had originally
received the message on 2 May, but it was withheld from Nasser until
the Sinai operation on 14 May. Although Hussein and Nasser had
accused each other in previous months of avoiding a fight with
Israel, Hussein was nevertheless wary that a war between Egypt and
Israel could risk Israel occupying the <font color="#556b2f">West
Bank. </font>Nasser still believed that the United States would
restrain Israel from attacking, because he had received assurances
<font color="#6b8e23">from the United States </font>and the Soviet

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On 21 May, Amer asked Nasser to
impose a blockade of <font color="#a9a9a9">the Strait of Tiran</font>,
and Nasser believed that Israel would use this as a casus belli. Amer
asserted that the army was ready for a confrontation, but Nasser
doubted Amer's assessment of the army's readiness. <font color="#dcdcdc">According
to </font>Nasser's Vice President <font color="#dcdcdc">Zakaria
Mohieddin, </font>although &quot;Amer had absolute control over the
armed forces, Nasser had his own way of knowing what was really
happening&quot;. Moreover, Amer anticipated the coming Israeli attack
and advocated a pre-emptive strike. Nasser declined the invitation,
saying that the air force lacked pilots and that the officers chosen
by Amer were incompetent. However, Nasser concluded that if Israel
attacked, Egypt's numerical advantage in men and weapons could deter
Israeli forces for at least two weeks, allowing for <font color="#2f4f4f">a
diplomatic ceasefire</font>. Towards the end of May, Nasser
increasingly traded the deterrent effect for an acceptance of the
inevitability of war, as both the Arab population and Arab
governments increasingly pressed him to act. On 26 May, Nasser
declared that &quot;our fundamental objective is the destruction of
Israel&quot;. On 30 May, King Hussein committed <font color="#556b2f">Jordan

conflict between Mr Nasser and Mr Amer subsequently came to the fore,
and officers present at the meeting said the duo broke out into a
&quot;non-stop shouting match&quot;. The Supreme Executive Committee
set up by Nasser to oversee the war explained Egypt's repeated
defeats as a rivalry between <font color="#dcdcdc">Nasser and Amer

Egyptian diplomat who became foreign minister during Sadat's

oust him on 27 August. Nasser was tipped off to their activities and,
after several invitations, he persuaded Amer to meet him at his home

Israel's withdrawal from the territories it had acquired in the war.
His supporters argued that Nasser's aim was to buy time to prepare

your opponent will not know which cards you have in your hand. In
this case, Nasser's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and

<font color="#2f4f4f">3 June 1963</font>) reigned as Pope from <font color="#6b8e23">28
October 1958 until his death in 1963, </font>and was canonised on <font color="#a0522d">27
April 2014</font>. Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was the fourth of
fourteen children born into a sharecropping family in a village in
Lombardy. He was ordained priest on <font color="#228b22">10 August
1904 </font>and served in various capacities, including as a papal
nuncio in France and as an ambassador to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey.
At the consistory on 12 January 1953, Pope Pius XII made Roncalli
Cardinal Primate of Santa Prisca, in addition to his appointment as
Patriarch of Venice.</p>

October 1958 </font><font color="#dcdcdc">at the age of 76 </font>after
11 votes. His election was unexpected, and Roncalli himself had come
to Rome on a return train ticket <font color="#2f4f4f">from Venice.
</font>He was the first pope to take the papal name 'John' on
election for <font color="#556b2f">more than </font><font color="#6b8e23">500
years, </font>and his election resolved the <font color="#a0522d">complex
issue of the official numbering attached to this papal title, which
</font>was due to the antipopes of this name. Pope John XXIII
surprised those who expected him to be the <font color="#228b22">acting
Pope by </font>convening the historic <font color="#191970">Vatican
II Council </font>(1962-65), whose first session opened on <font color="#8b0000">11
October 1962.</font> His passionate views on equality were summed up
in his famous statement: 'We are all created in the image of God, and
therefore we are all divinely equal'. John XXIII made many
impassioned speeches during his pontificate, one of which was on the
day he opened the Vatican II Council in the middle of the night to a
crowd gathered in St Peter's Square: &quot;Dear children, when you
return home you will find children: hug the children and say: this is
the Pope's hug!&quot;</p>

and a half years </font>after his election and two months after
completing his final and famous encyclical Pacem in terris. He was
buried <font color="#a0522d">in the Vatican caves under St Peter's
Basilica on </font>6 June 1963, and his successor, Pope Paul VI,
began his canonisation on 18 November 1965, proclaiming him a Servant
of God. In addition to being named Venerable by Pope John Paul II on
20 December 1999, he was beatified <font color="#191970">on 3
September 2000 </font>along with Pope Pius IX and three other popes.
After his beatification, his body was moved on 3 June 2001 from its
original place to the altar of St Jerome, where it was on display for
the faithful. Pope Francis proclaimed John XXIII a saint on 5 July
2013 - bypassing the traditionally required second miracle - with the
unanimous approval of the Consistory or Assembly of the College of
Cardinals, because he was considered to have lived a virtuous and
exemplary life and because he had benefited the Church by opening
Vatican Council II. He was canonised alongside Pope John Paul II on
27 April 2014. John XXIII is now affectionately known as <font color="#8b0000">the
&quot;Good Pope&quot; </font>and in Italian as &quot;il Papa buono&quot;.</p>

time as part of the basic structure of <font color="#dcdcdc">the

occur in <font color="#2f4f4f">sequence</font>. <font color="#556b2f">Sir
Isaac Newton </font>held this <font color="#6b8e23">realistic </font>view,
which is why it is sometimes called <font color="#a0522d">Newtonian
time</font>. According to the opposing view, time does not refer to
any 'container' through which events and objects 'move', nor to any
entity that 'flows', but is instead part of the <font color="#228b22">basic
intellectual structure </font>(along with space and number) within
which humans organise and compare events. This second view, in the
tradition of <font color="#191970">Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel
Kant, </font>holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and
therefore cannot be measured or <font color="#8b0000">travelled</font>.</p>

seven </font>basic physical quantities <font color="#2f4f4f">in </font>both
<font color="#2f4f4f">the International System of Units and the
International System of Magnitude</font>. Time is used to define

time in terms of such quantities would lead to a circular definition.
The operational definition of time, which states that the observation
of a given number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclic
event (such as the passage of a freely swinging pendulum) constitutes
one standard unit, such as a second, is very useful both in <font color="#6b8e23">advanced
experiments </font>and in everyday life. The operational definition
ignores the question of whether, in addition to the computation
mentioned above, there is something called time that passes and can
be measured. The study of <font color="#a0522d">the unified continuum
called spacetime </font>brings questions of space into the realm of

intercalation, which would add days or months to some years, the
seasons would drift rapidly in a calendar based on 12 months alone.
In Lunisolar calendars, a thirteenth month is added to some years to
make up the difference between a full year (now known to be about
365.24 days) and a year of only twelve months. The numbers <font color="#228b22">twelve
</font>and thirteen became prominent in many cultures, at least
partly because of this relationship between months and years. Other
early forms of calendar date back to <font color="#191970">Mesoamerica</font>,

Martin Heidegger, </font>we do not exist in time, we are time<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font>
The relation to the past is therefore the present's awareness that we
have been, which allows the past to exist in the present. Relation to
the future is a state of <font color="#dcdcdc">anticipation of </font><font color="#2f4f4f">a

human tendency to care and be concerned, which causes a &quot;being

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On 21 December 2011, the Bank
launched a programme to provide three-year (36-month) low-interest
loans at 1% to European banks that accept as collateral loans in
their portfolios. A total of EUR 489.2 billion (USD 640 billion) was
announced. The loans were not offered to European governments, but
government securities issued by European governments would be
eligible as collateral, as well as mortgage-backed securities and
other commercial paper that can be shown to be safe. The programme
was announced on 8 December 2011, but the volume of loans surprised
observers when it was implemented. Under the loan roll-over scheme,
it lent €489 billion to 523 banks for an exceptionally long period
of three years at an interest rate of only 1%. By far the largest
amount, €325 billion, went to banks in <font color="#a9a9a9">Greece,
Ireland, Italy and Spain. </font>In this way, the ECB sought to
ensure that banks had enough cash to pay off <font color="#dcdcdc">€200
billion of </font>their own maturing debt in the first three months
of 2012, while <font color="#2f4f4f">continuing to operate and lend

to buy government bonds, which <font color="#556b2f">would ease the

John's </font>is the foggiest (124 days), windiest (average speed
24.3 km/h) and cloudiest (1,497 hours of sunshine). During the winter
season, <font color="#2f4f4f">St John's </font>has milder
temperatures than other Canadian cities, and the mildest winter of
any Canadian city outside <font color="#556b2f">British Columbia</font>.
Rainfall is frequent and often abundant, and falls all year round.
<font color="#6b8e23">Summer </font>is the driest season on average,
with only occasional thunderstorms, and the wettest months are
October to January, with December being the wettest single month,
with an average of nearly <font color="#a0522d">165 mm of </font>rain.
The winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual in a humid
continental climate, where the precipitation maximum is usually in
late spring or early summer (e.g. most of the Midwestern United
States). Most of the heavy rainfall in St. John's is due to strong
mid-latitude storms from the northeastern United States and New
England, which are most frequent and intense from October to March,
bringing heavy rain (usually 4-8 cm of rain in a single storm) and
strong winds. In winter, two or more precipitation events (rain,
freezing rain, sleet and snow) can occur during a single storm.
Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 cm per winter season.
However, winter storms can bring varying types of precipitation.
Heavy snow can turn to heavy rain, melting the snowpack, and possibly
back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) during the same storm, with
little or no net accumulation of snow. Snow cover in St. John's is
variable, and especially in early winter, snow cover may develop
slowly, but may extend well into the spring months (March and April).

Hungary, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to wealthy Jewish
parents from Haskalah. He was the eldest of three children. He had

Neumann), was a <font color="#2f4f4f">banker </font>who had a

Ond (now part of Szerencs) in Zemplén County in northern Hungary.
Johannes's mother was <font color="#6b8e23">Kann Margit </font>(Margaret

generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the

of the best schools in Budapest, part of a brilliant education system
designed for the elite. In the Hungarian system, children received
all their education in one <font color="#dcdcdc">high school</font>.
Although the school was run by the Lutheran Church, most of its
pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation known for
its intellectual achievements, including Theodore von Kármán (b.

Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908) and Paul Erdős (b. 1913).
Collectively they were sometimes known as <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Marxists.</font> Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the
Lutheran school. When asked why his generation in Hungary had
produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The axiomatisation of mathematics
according to the Euclidean model of elements had reached a new level
of precision and scope by the end of the 19th century, especially in
arithmetic thanks to the axiom scheme of Richard Dedekind and Charles
Sanders Peirce, and in geometry thanks to David Hilbert.At the
beginning of the 20th century, attempts to base mathematics on naive
set theory suffered a setback <font color="#a9a9a9">because of
Russell's paradox </font>(the set of all sets that do not belong to
themselves). <font color="#dcdcdc">Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel
</font>implicitly solved the problem of the sufficient axiomatisation
of set theory some twenty years later. The Zermelo-Fraenkel set
theory provided a set of principles that allowed the construction of
sets used in everyday mathematics. However, they did not explicitly
exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to
itself. In his 1925 dissertation, von Neumann demonstrated two
techniques for ruling out such sets - the <font color="#2f4f4f">axiom
of constitution and the notion of a class.</font></p>

such that <font color="#dcdcdc">if one set belongs to another, the
first must necessarily be in sequential order before the second</font>,
thus ruling out the possibility that any set belongs to itself. To
show that the addition of this new axiom to the other axioms did not
lead to contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of proof

a short section of von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936 the need for
a new propositional calculus was demonstrated by a series of proofs.
For example, photons cannot pass through two consecutive
perpendicularly polarized filters (e.g. one horizontally and the
other vertically), and so they cannot pass in particular if a third
diagonally polarized filter is added to the other two filters either
before or after them in sequence, but if a third filter is added
between the other two, photons do indeed pass. This experimental fact
can be translated into logic as the non-commutativity of the
conjunction. It was also shown that <font color="#2f4f4f">the

be true even when both disjunctions are false, and </font>this in

property can be <font color="#2f4f4f">illustrated by a simple

electrons) with a semi-integral spin (angular momentum) and for which
there are only two possible values: positive or negative. In this
case, the indeterminacy principle shows that spin in two different
directions (e.g. x and y) leads to a pair of incompatible quantities.
Suppose that the state of a given electron ɸ verifies the
proposition &quot;the spin of the electron in the x direction is
positive&quot;. By the indeterminacy principle, the value of the spin
in the y direction is completely indeterminate for ɸ. Thus, ɸ
cannot verify the statement 'spin in the y-direction is positive' nor
the statement 'spin in the y-direction is negative'. However, the
disjunction of the sentences &quot;spin in direction y is positive or
spin in direction y is negative&quot; must be true for ɸ. Thus, in

Von Neumann showed that their minima are equal (in absolute value)
and opposite (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended minimax
theory to games involving imperfect information and games with more
than two players, and published this result in his 1944 <font color="#dcdcdc">Theory
of Games and Economic Behavior </font>(co-authored with <font color="#2f4f4f">Oskar
Morgenstern</font>). Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and
thought he would show it to von Neumann, who was interested in the
subject. He read it and told Morgenstern that he should write more
about it. This happened a couple of times, and then von Neumann
became the second author and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it
became a book. The public interest in this work was so great that the
New York Times wrote a front-page story about it. In the book, von
Neumann declared that economic theory had to use functional analytic
methods instead of traditional differential calculus, in particular
concave sets and topological fixed point theory, because the maximum

</font>1945, von Neumann, along with numerous other Manhattan Project
workers, witnessed the first atomic bomb explosion, code-named
Trinity, which was carried out as a test of an implosion device at a
bombing range near <font color="#dcdcdc">Alamogordo Army Airfield</font>,
56 km (35 miles) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico. Based on his
observations alone, von Neumann estimated that the explosion in the
test was equivalent to 5 kilotons of TNT (21 TJ), but Enrico Fermi
made a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping torn pieces
of paper as the shock wave passed his position and observing how far
they dispersed. The actual power of the explosion had been between <font color="#2f4f4f">20
and 22 kilotonnes</font>. The term &quot;kilotonne&quot; first
appeared in von Neumann's 1944 publications. After the war, Robert
Oppenheimer pointed out that the physicists involved in the Manhattan
Project had 'known the sin'. Von Neumann's reply was that 'sometimes
one confesses sin in order to take credit for it'.</p>

peace, and became one of those, along with Edward Teller, who
supported the hydrogen bomb project. He then collaborated with <font color="#a9a9a9">Klaus
Fuchs </font>on the further development of the bomb, and in 1946 they
filed a secret patent, &quot;Improvement in Methods and Means for
Utilizing Nuclear Energy&quot;, which outlined a plan to <font color="#dcdcdc">use
the fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to trigger nuclear fusion.</font>
The Fuchs-von Neumann patent used radiation implosion, but not in the
same way as the Teller-Ulam design that became the final hydrogen
bomb. However, their work was incorporated into Operation
Greenhouse's &quot;George&quot; shot, which was instructive in
testing the concepts that ended up in the final design. Fuchs-von
Neumann's work was forwarded by Fuchs <font color="#2f4f4f">to the
Soviet Union </font>as part of his nuclear intelligence, but was not
used in the Soviet Union's own independent development of the
Teller-Ulam plan. Historian Jeremy Bernstein has pointed out that,
ironically, &quot;John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs made an ingenious
invention in 1946 that could have changed the entire course of
hydrogen bomb development, but which was not fully understood until
the bomb was successfully manufactured&quot;.</p>

wrong, it did so clearly, unlike methods that could be subtly flawed.

with either bone or pancreatic cancer<font color="#a9a9a9">. </font>His
mother Margaret von Neumann was diagnosed with cancer in 1956 and
<font color="#dcdcdc">died within two weeks</font>. John had a <font color="#2f4f4f">year
and a half </font>from diagnosis to death. During this time, von
Neumann returned to Roman Catholicism, which had also been important
to his mother after the family's conversion between 1929 and 1930.
John had previously told his mother: &quot;God probably exists. A lot
of things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn't.&quot;
Von Neumann maintained his exemplary knowledge of Latin, quoting to a
visitor on his deathbed the proclamation &quot;Judex ergo cum
sedebit&quot;, ending with &quot;Quid sum miser tunc dicturus?&quot;.
Quem patronum rogaturus, Cum vix iustus sit securus?&quot; (When the
judge has taken his place ... What, then, am I the wretch to defend?
Who will intercede for me, when the righteous is scarce acquitted?).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">He invited a Roman Catholic priest,
Father Anselm Strittmatter, O.S.B., to visit him. Von Neumann is
reported to have said in his explanation that Pascal had something to
say, referring to Pascal's bet. <font color="#a9a9a9">Father
Strittmatter </font>delivered the last sacraments to him. Some of von
Neumann's friends (such as Abraham Pais and Oskar Morgenstern) said
that they had <font color="#dcdcdc">always considered him 'totally
agnostic'. &quot;</font>Of this deathbed conversion, Morgenstern told
Heims: 'He was, of course, a complete agnostic all his life, and then
<font color="#2f4f4f">he suddenly converted to Catholicism - it
doesn't fit in with anything in his attitude, views and thinking when
he was healthy.</font>'&quot; Father Strittmatter recalled that von
Neumann did <font color="#556b2f">not get much peace or comfort from
it, as he still feared death</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The console was first officially
announced at E3 2005 and released at <font color="#a9a9a9">the end of
2006</font>. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its
primary storage medium. It was the first PlayStation to integrate
social gaming services, including the first to introduce Sony's
social gaming service <font color="#dcdcdc">PlayStation Network </font>and
its remote connection to the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation
Vita, allowing remote control of the console from these devices. In
<font color="#2f4f4f">September 2009, the </font>Slim version of the
<font color="#6b8e23">PlayStation </font><font color="#a0522d">3 </font>was
released, which was lighter and thinner than the original version,
and included a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a
minor boot change to the software. The <font color="#228b22">Super
Slim </font>model was then released in late <font color="#191970">2012</font>,
with further refinements and redesigns. As of March 2016, <font color="#8b0000">85

lower power consumption and <font color="#556b2f">a quieter </font>cooling
system. It was released in major regions in September 2009. With the

font used in the title of Sony's Spider-Man 3 movie) and the
PLAYSTATION 3 in capital letters. Instead, the console logo reverts
to the more traditional PlayStation and PlayStation 2 logo
&quot;PlayStation 3&quot; with &quot;PS3&quot; printed on top of the
console. With the redesign of the console and logo, the start screen
of all consoles changed <font color="#a0522d">from &quot;</font><font color="#228b22">Sony

with an official separate 250 GB hard drive. An upright stand was

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On March 1, 2010 (UTC), many of the
original &quot;fat&quot; PlayStation 3 models worldwide experienced
bugs related to their <font color="#a9a9a9">internal system clock</font>.
The bug had many symptoms. Initially, the main problem appeared to be
an inability to connect to <font color="#dcdcdc">the PlayStation
Network.</font> However, the root cause of the problem was not
related to the PlayStation Network, as users who had never been
online also had problems playing installed offline games (which
prompted the system timer as part of the boot process) and using
system themes. At the same time, many users noticed that the console
clock had moved back <font color="#2f4f4f">to 31 December 1999</font>.
The event was nicknamed <font color="#556b2f">ApocalyPS3, a </font>play
on the words <font color="#6b8e23">apocalypse </font>and PS3, the
abbreviation for the PlayStation 3 console.</p>

demos, game and system software updates automatically downloaded to
PlayStation 3. Subscribers will also receive early or exclusive
access to some beta versions, game demos, premium downloadable
content and other PlayStation Store products. North American users
will also receive a free Qore subscription. Users can choose to
purchase a <font color="#a0522d">one-year </font>or three-month

information had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled
out, and Sony informed customers that their credit card information
may have been obtained. In addition, the credit card numbers were
encrypted and Sony never collected the three-digit CVC or CSC number
on the back of the credit cards, which is required to authenticate

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although the PlayStation 3's
predecessors had been very dominant competitors and very profitable
for Sony, the PlayStation 3 got off to an inauspicious start, with
Sir Howard Stringer, Chairman and CEO of Sony, initially failing to
convince investors that Sony's fortunes would turn around. The PS3
lacked <font color="#a9a9a9">the unique gameplay of </font>the
cheaper <font color="#dcdcdc">Wii </font>and became the most
successful console of that generation in terms of units sold. In
addition, the PS3 had to compete directly with the Xbox 360, which
had a head start in the market, which meant that the PS2 no longer
had PS2-exclusive titles such as Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy
(<font color="#2f4f4f">Xbox 360:versions </font>were generally
considered superior to cross-platform games in 2006, but by 2008 the
PS3 versions had reached or even surpassed parity), and the PS3's
strong sales and catching up with the Xbox 360 took longer than
expected. Sony also continued to lose money on every PS3 sold until
<font color="#556b2f">2010</font>, although the redesigned 'thin' PS3
has since reduced these losses<font color="#556b2f">.</font></p>

gaming machine into an even smaller package while retaining the same
features as its predecessor: a large game library and a strong
selection of streaming services [...]&quot;, while criticising the

stating, &quot;Sometimes [the lid] doesn't grip, and it feels like
you're using one of those old credit card printers. In short, it
feels cheap. You don't realise how handy automatic disc-loaders are
until they're gone. Whether you're looking to cut costs or save
space, this move is ultimately a step backwards.&quot; Criticism was
also levelled at the price, with the cheapest Super Slim model said
to still be <font color="#6b8e23">more expensive </font>than the
cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and larger hard drive
should not be considered an upgrade when the Slim model's hard drive
is easy to remove and replace. However, they boasted that the Super
Slim <font color="#a0522d">hard drive </font>is &quot;the easiest to
use so far. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals a drive bay
that can be quickly removed.&quot; They also noted that while the
Super Slim model is by no means an upgrade, it may be a sign of
things to come. &quot;It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim
PS3 is the same impressive device in a much smaller package. Existing
PS3 owners don't seem to have any reason to upgrade, but for
prospective PS3 buyers, Super Slim is probably the best option if
they can put up with not having a slot-loading disc drive.&quot;</p>

The </font>execution was not to be allowed after the trial, but by a
bill to which Henry had to give his consent in person <font color="#556b2f">after
hearing the full text</font>. Henry decided that 'to repeat so sad a
tale and tell so infamous a crime' in his presence 'might reopen a
wound which had already closed in the royal breast'. Parliament
therefore added a clause to <font color="#6b8e23">the Act stating
that the </font>consent of the Commissioners &quot;is, always has
been, and always will be as good&quot; as that of the Sovereign in

assent </font>has the same legal effect as royal consent; the Belgian
Constitution requires that any theoretical refusal of royal assent
must be signed - like any other act of the monarch - by the Minister
responsible in the Chamber of Deputies. The Monarch promulgates the
law, which means that he formally orders its official publication and
implementation. In <font color="#2f4f4f">1990, </font>when <font color="#556b2f">King
Baudouin </font>informed his cabinet that he could not in good
conscience sign the bill decriminalising abortion (a refusal which
the minister responsible clearly could not cover), the <font color="#6b8e23">Council
of Ministers</font>, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin
incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian
Constitution, the Council of Ministers took over the powers of the
Head of State following the declaration of the incapacity of the
monarch until such time as Parliament could decide on the incapacity
of the King and appoint a replacement. The bill was then adopted by
all members of the Council of Ministers &quot;on behalf of the
Belgian people&quot;. At <font color="#a0522d">a joint </font>meeting

group </font>is an <font color="#dcdcdc">algebraic structure

inclusiveness, associativity, identifiability and reversibility. One
of the best known examples of a group is the <font color="#556b2f">set

the study of polynomial equations, </font>begun by <font color="#dcdcdc">Évariste
Galois </font>in the 1830s. After contributions from other fields,

Modern group theory - an active mathematical discipline - studies
groups as a field in its own right.a['] To study groups,
mathematicians have invented various concepts to divide groups into
smaller, more understandable parts, such as <font color="#556b2f">subgroups,
</font><font color="#6b8e23">loan groups and simple groups</font><font color="#556b2f">.</font>
In addition to abstract properties, group theorists also study
different ways of expressing a group in concrete terms (its group
representations), both from a theoretical and computational point of
view. A theory of finite groups has been developed, culminating in
the classification of finite simple groups published in <font color="#a0522d">1983</font>.aa[']

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The standard home video LaserDisc
was <font color="#a9a9a9">30 cm (12 inches) in diameter </font>and
consisted of two single-sided aluminium discs coated with plastic.
Although LaserDiscs looked similar to CDs or DVDs, they used analogue
video recorded in a composite area (the video bandwidth was roughly
equivalent to that of a 25 mm (1 inch) C-type VCR), analogue FM
stereo sound and digital PCM sound. In its most basic form, the
LaserDisc was still recorded as a series of bumps and flats, just as
CDs, DVDs and even Blu-ray discs are today. Although the encoding is
binary in nature, the information is still encoded as analog
pulse-width modulation with a 50% duty cycle, so the information is
contained in the lengths and spacings of the pits. In real digital
media, the pits or their edges directly represent the <font color="#dcdcdc">1's
and 0's of the </font>digital binary data stream. The first
LaserDiscs, introduced in 1978, were fully <font color="#2f4f4f">analogue</font>,
but the format evolved to include digital stereo audio in CD format
(sometimes with TOSlink or coaxial output for feeding an external
DAC) and later multi-channel formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When Pioneer introduced digital
audio on LaserDisc in 1985, it further developed the CAA format. The
CAA55 format was introduced in 1985, with a total recording capacity
of <font color="#a9a9a9">55 minutes and 5 seconds </font>per side.
The video capacity was reduced to overcome bandwidth problems with
the inclusion of digital audio. Several films released between 1985
and 1987 were analogue-only discs because of their <font color="#dcdcdc">length
and the desire to keep the film on a single disc (e.g. </font>Back to
the Future). By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges
and was once again able to encode on CAA60, allowing a total running
time of <font color="#2f4f4f">60 minutes and 5 seconds</font>.
Pioneer further improved the CAA and offered the CAA45, which encoded
45 minutes of material, but filled the entire disc playback platform.
The CAA65, which was used in only a few titles, offered 65 minutes
and 5 seconds of playback time per side. There are a handful of
titles printed by Technidisc that used the CAA50. The last CAA option
is the CAA70, which offered 70 minutes of playback time per side.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Sound could be recorded in either
analogue or digital format and in various surround sound formats; two
analogue audio tracks and two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks
(EFM, CIRC, 16-bit and 44.056 kHz sample rate) could be recorded on
NTSC discs. PAL discs could have one pair of audio tracks, either
analogue or digital, and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit
at 44.1 kHz, as on CDs; in the UK the term <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;LaserVision&quot;
is used to refer to discs with analogue audio, while the term
&quot;LaserDisc&quot; is used for discs with digital audio.</font> In
both formats, the digital audio signal is EFM encoded as on CDs.
Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS - now common on DVDs - first
became available on LaserDisc, and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom
Menace (1999), released on LaserDisc in Japan, is one of the first
home video releases to feature <font color="#dcdcdc">6.1-channel
Dolby Digital EX Surround. </font>Unlike DVDs, which record <font color="#2f4f4f">Dolby
Digital audio in digital format</font>, LaserDiscs record Dolby
Digital audio in a frequency-modulated format on a track normally
used for analogue sound. Decoding Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc
required not only an AC-3 decoder but also a player with a special
&quot;AC-3 RF&quot; output and an external demodulator. The
demodulator was needed to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3
information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder
could process. DTS audio replaced digital audio tracks when available
on disc; all that was required to hear DTS audio was an
S/PDIF-compatible digital connection to a DTS decoder.</p>

removed the demodulator circuit. Although DVD players could play
Dolby Digital tracks, the signal from the DVD player was not in a

LaserDisc AC-3. External demodulators were available for some time
which converted the AC-3 signal into a Dolby Digital standard signal

early and inferior LD players had poor analogue audio components, and
many early records had poorly mastered analogue audio tracks, making

highly undesirable for serious enthusiasts. Early DiscoVision and
LaserDisc films had no digital soundtrack option, but many of these
films received digital sound on later <font color="#2f4f4f">Universal
</font>reissues, and the quality of the analogue soundtracks
generally improved considerably over time. Many discs that originally
had the old analogue stereo tracks received new Dolby Stereo and
Dolby Surround tracks, often in addition to the digital tracks, which
helped improve the sound quality. Later analogue discs also used CX

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Both AC-3 and DTS surround sound
were implemented clumsily on LaserDisc discs, leading to interesting
player- and disc-dependent problems. A disc with AC-3 audio lost the
<font color="#a9a9a9">correct analog audio channel </font>to the
modulated AC-3 RF stream. If the player did not have an AC-3 output,
the next most attractive playback option was <font color="#dcdcdc">digital
Dolby Surround or stereo soundtrack</font>. The reason for this is
that the RF signal must bypass the audio circuit in order for the
demodulator to process it properly. If the player did not support
digital audio tracks (common on older players) or the disc did not
contain any digital audio tracks at all (rare on a disc mastered with
an AC-3 audio track), the only option was monophonic playback of the
left analog audio track. However, many older analogue players not
only did not print AC-3 streams correctly, but were not even aware of
their possible existence. Such players prefer to reproduce analog
audio tracks verbatim, resulting in <font color="#2f4f4f">a garbled

&quot;LaserDisc&quot; designation was used exclusively for the
instrument itself, although the official name was &quot;LaserVision&quot;
(as at the beginning of many LaserDisc releases just before the start
of the film). However, as Pioneer reminded numerous video magazines
and shops in 1984, LaserDisc was a trademarked word used only in

Video or Pioneer Electronics. An advertisement for the LD-700 player

'Pioneer LaserDisc branded video disc player'. From 1981 until the

records for other companies such as <font color="#a9a9a9">Paramount,
Disney and Warner Bros</font>. Some of them added their own names to
the cover of the disc to indicate that the film was not owned by MCA.
After Discovision Associates went out of business in early 1982,
Universal Studios' videodisc software brand, known as MCA Videodisc
until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately,
many of them, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were
time-packaged versions of the original CAV or CLV DiscoVision films.
The CLV re-release of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, as
the video disc version had to replace the background music due to
licensing costs (the music was not available until the THX LaserDisc
box set release in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production, <font color="#dcdcdc">The
Electric Horseman, </font>released by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV
and CLV versions, is still not available in any other home video
format with the original music; even in the most recent DVD release,
the music has been significantly replaced, both for the instrumental
score and the Willie Nelson tracks. In Universal's MCA release of
Howard the Duck, <font color="#2f4f4f">only the opening credits are

</font>TVL lines on NTSC discs and 440 TVL lines on PAL discs,
compared to only 240 TVL lines on NTSC discs for VHS discs. It could
handle analogue and digital audio, while VHS discs were mostly
analogue only (VHS discs can have PCM audio for professional use, but
this is rare), and NTSC discs could record multiple audio tracks.
This allowed for additional materials such as director's commentary
tracks and other extras to be added to the film, creating &quot;Special
Edition&quot; releases that would not have been possible on VHS. The
discs were random and chapter-based, like the DVD format, meaning
that you could move from disc to disc very quickly. By comparison,
getting to certain points on VHS discs required laborious rewinding
and fast-forwarding.</p>

the copying process was much simpler. A VHS cassette has <font color="#dcdcdc">at

has a single part with five or six layers. A disc can be stamped in a
few seconds, whereas duplicating a videotape required a complex loose
tape duplication mechanism and was a time-consuming process. However,
in the late 1980s, the average price of disc stamping was over <font color="#2f4f4f">$5.00
per two-ply disc, </font>due to the large amount of plastic material
and the expensive glass-mastering process required to make metal

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The lifetime of <font color="#a9a9a9">laser
discs </font>was potentially much longer than that of video
cassettes. Because the discs were read optically rather than
magnetically, there was no need for physical contact between the
player and the disc, except for the player's clamp, which holds the
disc in the centre as it is spun and read. Thus, playback does not
wear out the information-carrying part of the disc, and properly
manufactured LD discs theoretically last longer than the lifetime of
a single human being. In contrast, with VHS tape, all the image and
sound information was contained on the tape <font color="#dcdcdc">in
a magnetic coating </font>that was in contact with the rotating ends
of the drum, causing <font color="#2f4f4f">gradual wear with each use
</font>(although later in the VHS life cycle, technological
improvements allowed tapes to be manufactured and played without
contact). In addition, the tape was thin and fragile, and the player
mechanism, especially on a poor quality or poorly functioning model,
could easily mishandle the tape and damage it by crumpling it,
fraying (stretching) its edges or even breaking it.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">LaserDisc was a composite video
format: luminance (black and white) and chrominance (colour) were
transmitted in a single signal, which was separated by <font color="#a9a9a9">a

the two signals cannot be completely separated. On DVDs, the data is
stored in <font color="#dcdcdc">digital blocks, each forming a

used to master the disc. The signals range from composite and split
signals to YUV and RGB signals. Depending on which format is used,
this can result in much higher image quality, especially in areas
with strong colour boundaries or detail (especially if there is
moderate motion in the image) and <font color="#2f4f4f">low contrast

sequences) or contrast banding (<font color="#2f4f4f">subtle visible

the potential to outperform the LaserDisc versions, but often they
could only match them in terms of picture quality, and in some cases
the LaserDisc version was superior. However, the use of proprietary,

considerably, depending on the playback time and the complexity of

The success of this feature depends on the amount of damage.
LaserDisc players recover from such errors more quickly than DVD
players when operating in full analogue mode. A direct comparison is
almost impossible because of the large size differences between the
two media. A one-inch (3 cm) scratch on a DVD is likely to cause more

&quot;flip&quot; discs automatically by flipping the optical pickup

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In addition, LaserDisc videos
sometimes have a problem known as <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;crosstalk&quot;</font>.
The problem can occur <font color="#dcdcdc">when the player's laser
optical pickup assembly is out of alignment or because the disc is
damaged or excessively warped</font>, but it can also occur with a
properly functioning player and a new disc purchased from the
factory, depending on electrical and mechanical alignment problems.
In these cases, the problem is due to the fact that CLV discs require
subtle changes in rotational speed at various points during playback.
As the speed changes, the optical pickup of the player may read video
information from a track adjacent to the intended track, causing the
data on the two tracks to 'cross'; the extra video information picked
up from the other track appears in the image as distortions
resembling <font color="#2f4f4f">rotating 'barber poles' or moving
static lines.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Question 0</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Assuming that the optical receiver
of the player is in good condition, cross-vibration distortions do
not usually occur during playback of CAV-format LaserDiscs because
<font color="#dcdcdc">the rotation speed never varies</font>.
However, if the player is not properly calibrated, or if the CAV disc
is defective or damaged, other problems affecting tracking
performance may occur. One such problem is 'laser lock', where <font color="#2f4f4f">the
player reads the same two fields from a given image over and over

LaserDiscs is the <font color="#a9a9a9">inconsistent </font>playback
quality between different manufacturers and player models<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font>
On most televisions, a particular DVD player produces an image that
cannot be visually distinguished from other devices. Differences in
picture quality between different players are only readily apparent
on larger televisions, and significant leaps in picture quality are
usually only achieved with expensive high-end players that can
post-process the MPEG-2 stream during playback. In contrast, the
quality of LaserDisc playback depends to a large extent on <font color="#dcdcdc">the
quality of the hardware.</font> There are large differences in
picture quality between different manufacturers and models of LD
players, even when tested on a small or medium sized TV set. The
obvious advantages of using high quality equipment have helped to
keep the demand for some players high, which has also kept the prices
of these players relatively high. Major players sold for <font color="#2f4f4f">well
over $200 to well over $1000 </font>in the 1990s, while older and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">LaserDisc did not achieve widespread

and because they were confused in the market with the technically
inferior CED disc, also called Videodisc. Although not widely adopted

enthusiasts due to its superior sound and picture quality compared to
VHS and Betamax tapes, and was found in <font color="#dcdcdc">nearly
one million </font>American homes by the end of 1990. The format was
more popular in Japan than in North America because <font color="#2f4f4f">prices

differential between VHS tapes and higher quality LaserDiscs was
minimal, helping to ensure that it quickly became the dominant
consumer video format in Japan. Anime collectors in every country

also quick to embrace the format, demanding the higher picture and
sound quality of LaserDiscs and the numerous titles that were not
available on VHS. <font color="#556b2f">LaserDiscs </font>were also a
popular alternative to videocassettes among film lovers in wealthier

although people rarely bought discs (as LDs were priced at around

the city's video rental business to grow larger than it had ever been

created a market for multi-system TVs and multi-system video

introduced the </font>EditDroid non-linear editing system for film
and television, based on computer-controlled LaserDisc players.
Instead of printing day-by-day images on film, the processed
negatives from the day of shooting were sent to a mastering facility
where they were assembled from 10-minute camera elements into
20-minute film clips. These were then mastered onto single-sided
blank LaserDiscs, just as DVDs are burned at home today, which
facilitated selection and editing decisions. At a time when a video
assistant was not available for filming, this was the only way the
film crew could see their work. The EDL list went to the negative
editor, who then cut the camera negative accordingly and assembled
the finished film. Only <font color="#dcdcdc">24 </font>EditDroid
systems were built, although the ideas and technology are still in
use today. Subsequent EditDroid experiments borrowed the hard disk
technology of having multiple disks on the same spindle, and added
numerous playback heads and electronics to the basic jukebox
structure so that any part of any disk could be accessed in seconds.

video images. The discs were in CAV format, and the data were encoded
as a binary signal represented by an analogue audio recording. These
discs could contain video/audio or video/binary data in each CAV
frame, but not both. The &quot;data&quot; frames appeared blank when
played back as video. It was typical for each disc to start with a
disc list (a few blank frames), then a video presentation before the
rest of the data. Because the format (based on the ADFS hard disk
format) used a start sector for each file, the data layout bypassed
virtually all video frames. If all 54,000 frames were used to store
data, an LV-ROM disk could contain 324 MB of data per side. The
Domesday project systems also included a genlock that allowed video
images, video clips and sound to be mixed with graphics from BBC

it in <font color="#2f4f4f">1984.</font> RLV discs, like CRVdisc, are

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During George's reign, the
disintegration of the British <font color="#a9a9a9">Empire </font>and
its transition to a Commonwealth accelerated. The Irish Free State
Parliament removed the direct reference to the monarch from the Irish
constitution on the day of his accession. From 1939, the Empire and
the Commonwealth, with the exception of Ireland, was at war with Nazi
Germany. War with Italy and Japan followed in <font color="#dcdcdc">1940
</font>and <font color="#2f4f4f">1941</font>. Although Britain and
its allies were eventually victorious in <font color="#556b2f">1945</font>,
the United States and the <font color="#6b8e23">Soviet Union </font>emerged
as major world powers and the British Empire declined. After the
independence of India and Pakistan in <font color="#a0522d">1947,
</font>George remained king of both countries, but the title of<font color="#228b22">
Emperor of India </font>was relinquished in June 1948. Ireland
formally declared itself <font color="#191970">a republic </font>and
seceded from the Commonwealth in <font color="#8b0000">1949, </font>and
India became a Commonwealth republic the following year. George
adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. In the latter

December </font><font color="#2f4f4f">1895) marked the </font>34th
anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Prince <font color="#556b2f">Albert</font>,
Prince Consort. Unsure how Prince Consort's widow, Queen <font color="#6b8e23">Victoria</font>,
would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the
Duke of York that the Queen had been 'rather distressed'. Two days
later he wrote again: &quot;I really think she would be delighted if
you yourself suggested the name Albert to her&quot;. Queen Victoria
was mollified by the suggestion to name the new baby Albert and wrote
to the Duchess of York: 'I am impatiently awaiting the new child,
born on so sad a day, but much dearer to me, especially as he will be
called by that dear name which is the watchword for all that is great
and good'. Thus he was christened &quot;Albert Frederick Arthur
George&quot; <font color="#a0522d">at St Mary Magdalene's Church </font>near
Sandringham three months later.[a] As the great-grandson of <font color="#228b22">Queen
Victoria, </font>he was officially known from his birth as His Royal
Highness Prince Albert of York. Within the family he was known
informally as &quot;<font color="#191970">Bertie</font>&quot;. His
maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first

to take on more royal duties. He represented his father and toured
coal mines, factories and railway yards. Such visits earned him the
nickname '<font color="#2f4f4f">the industrial prince</font>'. His
stammering and consequent embarrassment, and his tendency to shyness,
made him seem much less impressive than his older brother <font color="#556b2f">Edward</font>.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Albert adopted the royal name
&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">George VI&quot; </font>to emphasise
continuity with his father and to restore confidence in the monarchy.
The early part of George VI's reign was spent dealing with his
predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and status were
uncertain. He had been presented as 'His Royal Highness Prince
Edward' for the abdication mission, but George VI considered that by
abdicating and renouncing the right of succession Edward had
forfeited the right to bear royal titles, including 'Royal Highness'.
George's first act as king was to give his brother the title and
style of '<font color="#dcdcdc">His Royal Highness the Duke of
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">Windsor</font><font color="#dcdcdc">',
but </font>the letters establishing the duchy prevented his wife or
children from wearing the royal style. George VI also had to buy the
royal residences of <font color="#556b2f">Balmoral Castle </font><font color="#6b8e23">and
Sandringham House </font>from Edward<font color="#6b8e23">, as these
</font>were private properties and did not automatically pass to
George VI. Three days after his accession, <font color="#a0522d">on
his 41st birthday, </font>he conferred on his wife, the new Queen
<font color="#228b22">Consort, the title of Garter Knight</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The growing likelihood of war in
Europe dominated the early administration of George VI. The king was
constitutionally obliged to support Prime Minister <font color="#a9a9a9">Neville
</font>Chamberlain's <font color="#dcdcdc">appeasement of </font>Hitler.
However, when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return
from negotiating the <font color="#2f4f4f">Munich </font><font color="#556b2f">Agreement
</font>in <font color="#6b8e23">1938</font>, they invited him to join
them on the balcony of <font color="#a0522d">Buckingham Palace.</font>
This public contact between the monarchy and the politician was
exceptional, as the balcony was traditionally restricted to the royal
family. Although Chamberlain's Hitler policy was generally popular
with the public, there was some opposition to it in the House of
Commons, leading historian <font color="#228b22">John Grigg to
</font>describe the King's behaviour in such a prominent association
with the politician as 'the most unconstitutional act by a British
monarch this century'.</p>

From Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister <font color="#dcdcdc">William

their journey to introduce themselves to North America <font color="#2f4f4f">as
the King and Queen of Canada</font>. George was the first reigning
monarch to visit North America, although he had previously visited
Canada as Prince Albert and the Duke of York. Both the
Governor-General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, and Mackenzie King hoped
that the King's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles
of the 1931 Westminster Charter, which <font color="#556b2f">gave
full sovereignty to the British dominions. On </font>19 May, George
VI personally accepted the credentials of the new US <font color="#6b8e23">Ambassador
to Canada, </font>Daniel Calhoun Roper, gave Royal Assent to nine
Bills in Parliament and ratified two international treaties under the
Canadian seal. The official historian of the Royal Tour, Gustave
Lanctot, wrote that &quot;the Statute of Westminster had come to full

of the British Empire accelerated. The 1931 Statute of Westminster
had already recognised that the Dominions had become separate
sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a
voluntary association of sovereign states known as the <font color="#a9a9a9">Commonwealth
</font>accelerated after the Second World War. Under Clement Attlee's
ministership, British India was divided into two independent
dominions, <font color="#dcdcdc">India and Pakistan</font>, in <font color="#2f4f4f">1947.</font>
George renounced the title of Emperor of India and instead became
King of India and King of Pakistan. In 1950 he ceased to be King of
India when India became a Commonwealth republic, but he remained King
of Pakistan until his death, when India recognised his new title as
Head of the Commonwealth. Other countries seceded from the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As a clear and precise definition
has not been agreed until recently, the concept was thought to mean
(in short) &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">the sharing of sovereignty
between two levels of government</font>&quot;. However, recent
studies have shown that this cannot be the case, since the sharing of
sovereignty - when properly understood in its essential sense as the
<font color="#dcdcdc">ultimate and absolute source of political power
in a political community - is not possible. </font>This was
demonstrated by the <font color="#dcdcdc">United States' </font><font color="#2f4f4f">entry
into </font><font color="#556b2f">civil war in </font><font color="#2f4f4f">the
mid-19th century </font>over disputes over the undivided powers of
slavery and, ultimately, the right of secession. Either level of
government could be sovereign to decide such matters, but not both
simultaneously. It is therefore now suggested that federalism is more
appropriately conceived of as 'the division of sovereignty powers
between two levels of government'. What distinguishes the concept
from other multi-level political forms is <font color="#6b8e23">the
nature of the </font><font color="#a0522d">equal status between the
two levels of government. </font>This clarified definition makes it
possible to identify <font color="#228b22">two different forms of
federalism</font>, whereas previously only one was known, depending
on whether sovereignty is total (one nation) or partial (many
nations): the <font color="#191970">federal state (or federation) </font>and
the confederation (or confederation of federations). Leading examples
of federalism are the United States, Germany, Canada, Switzerland,
Australia and India. The leading example of a confederation of states
is the <font color="#483d8b">European </font><font color="#8b0000">Union</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The terms &quot;federalism&quot; and
&quot;confederalism&quot; derive from the Latin word <font color="#a9a9a9">foedus</font>,
which means agreement, treaty or union. Their common meaning until
the late 1700s was a <font color="#dcdcdc">simple union or
intergovernmental relationship between sovereign states based on a
treaty.</font> They were therefore originally synonymous. In this
sense, James Madison, in Federalist 39, referred to the new United
States as <font color="#556b2f">'neither a national nor a federal
constitution, but a combination of both</font><font color="#6b8e23">'
</font>(i.e. not a single great unitary state, nor a union or
confederation of several small states, but a combination of the two).
Over the course of the nineteenth century, the meaning of federalism
would change and strengthen to refer exclusively to a new unified
political form, while confederalism would remain a federation of
states. Thus, this article is related to the modern use of the word
&quot;federalism&quot;.</p>

originally meant <font color="#a9a9a9">a belief in a stronger central

stronger central government, </font>while the &quot;anti-federalists&quot;
wanted <font color="#556b2f">a weaker central government</font>. This
is very different from the current use of &quot;federalism&quot; in

'federalism<font color="#6b8e23">' is situated </font><font color="#a0522d">in

Australian federal government began to function, resulting in the
establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The

a military coup led to the creation of the presidential system led by
Deodoro da Fonseca</font><font color="#2f4f4f">. </font>With the help

Brazilian constitutions from <font color="#556b2f">1891 </font>onwards,
although some of them distorted some of the federalist principles.
The 1937 constitution, for example, gave the federal government the
power to appoint state governors (called intervenors) at will,
centralising power in the hands of President Getúlio Vargas. Brazil
also uses <font color="#6b8e23">the Fonseca system </font><font color="#a0522d">to

states were pre-existing political entities</font>, the US
Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any
particular place, but it often mentioned the rights and duties of
state governments and officials in relation to the federal
government. The federal government has certain explicit powers (also
called <font color="#dcdcdc">enumerated powers</font>) that are
<font color="#556b2f">constitutionally defined </font>powers,
including <font color="#6b8e23">the power to levy taxes, declare war,
and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. </font>In addition, the
Necessity and Due Process Clause <font color="#a0522d">gives the
federal government the implied power to enact any law that is
&quot;necessary and proper&quot; to carry out its express powers</font><font color="#228b22">.</font>
Other powers - reserved powers - are reserved to the people or the
states. The power delegated to the federal government was
significantly expanded by the Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland
(1819), by post-Civil War constitutional amendments, and by some
subsequent amendments - as well as by the Civil War's general
assertion that the states were legally subject to the final dictates
of the federal government.</p>

from country to country and in historical context</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Movements

For example, at the time of the creation of these states in the
<font color="#6b8e23">United States and Australia, </font>groups
called &quot;federalists&quot; advocated the creation of a strong
central government. Similarly, in European Union politics,
federalists mostly sought greater integration of the EU. In Spain and
post-war Germany, on the other hand, federalist movements have tended
to favour decentralisation, i.e. the transfer of power from central
government to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has
been a political force for several decades, the federalist tendency
seeks to keep Quebec within Canada.</p>

at the same time they are states (or have the characteristics of

all the sovereignty which they do not cede to the federal government

<font color="#556b2f">as the 1988 Constitution incorporated
municipalities as independent political entities, making the federal
system a tripartite one</font>, comprising the Union, the states and

</font>which are partially independent of both the federal and state
governments. Each municipality has a 'minor constitution', called an
'organic law' (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case in the
sense that the federal constitution grants full autonomy to
municipalities, and the federal government confirms their existence
as autonomous entities (municipio libre, &quot;free municipality&quot;),
which cannot be overridden by state constitutions. In addition, the
federal constitution specifies which powers and competences belong
exclusively to the municipalities and not to the states. However,
municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Federalism also manifests itself in
<font color="#a9a9a9">ecclesiology</font> (<font color="#a9a9a9">church
doctrine)</font>. For example, Presbyterian church government is
largely similar to parliamentary republicanism (a form of political
federalism). In Presbyterian denominations, the <font color="#dcdcdc">local
congregation is led by elected elders, </font><font color="#2f4f4f">some
of whom are ministers.</font> Each congregation then sends
representatives or delegates to the presbyteries and on to the
General Assembly. Each of the larger congregations has
decision-making power <font color="#556b2f">over its members.</font>
In this governance structure, each component has some degree of
sovereignty over itself. As in political federalism, there is a
<font color="#6b8e23">shared sovereignty in </font>Presbyterian
ecclesiology.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Some Christians argue that the
earliest source of political federalism (or federalism of human
institutions, as opposed to theological federalism) <font color="#a9a9a9">is
the </font><font color="#dcdcdc">form of ecclesiastical federalism
found in the Bible</font><font color="#a9a9a9">. </font>They point to
the structure of the early Christian church as described (and
prescribed, many believe) in the <font color="#2f4f4f">New Testament.
</font>In their arguments, this is particularly evident in the
Jerusalem Council described in Acts 15, where the <font color="#556b2f">apostles
and elders came together to lead the church</font>; the apostles were
representatives of the universal church and the elders of the local
church. Today, elements of federalism <font color="#6b8e23">can be
found in </font><font color="#a0522d">almost every Christian
denomination</font><font color="#6b8e23">, some more than others.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In almost all federal states, the
central government has <font color="#a9a9a9">foreign policy and
national defence powers as an exclusive federal prerogative</font>.
If this were not the case, the <font color="#dcdcdc">federation would
not be a single sovereign state </font>according to the UN
definition. The <font color="#2f4f4f">German </font>Länder <font color="#2f4f4f">still
have the right to act in their own name at the international level,
</font><font color="#556b2f">which was originally a </font>condition
granted in exchange for the Kingdom of Bavaria's agreement to join
the German Empire in 1871. In addition, the exact division of power
varies from nation to nation. The German and US constitutions provide
that all powers not expressly vested in the federal government remain
with the states. In some countries, such as Canada and India, the
constitutions state that the federal government retains all powers
not expressly granted to the state governments. The Australian
Constitution, like the US system, gives the federal government (the
Commonwealth of Australia) the power to legislate on certain matters
deemed too difficult for the states to manage, leaving all other
responsibilities to the states. Under the division of competences
between the European Union and the <font color="#a0522d">States</font>,
as laid down in the Lisbon Treaty, the <font color="#6b8e23">States
retain competences that are not exclusively within the competence of
the European Union or that are not shared between the EU and the
States as parallel competences.</font></p>
