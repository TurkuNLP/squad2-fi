of England, the </font>ecclesiastical courts, which previously
settled many cases, such as marriage, divorce, wills and defamation
disputes, still have jurisdiction over certain church-related matters
(e.g. clergy discipline, change of church property and church land).
Their separate status dates back to the 13th century, when the
Normans separated them from the <font color="#556b2f">mixed, secular
and religious county and local courts used by the Germans. </font>Unlike
other <font color="#6b8e23">English </font>courts, the law applicable
to ecclesiastical matters is at least partly civil, not <font color="#a0522d">common
law</font>, although it is largely governed by parliamentary rules.
Since the Reformation, the English ecclesiastical courts have been
<font color="#228b22">royal courts</font>. <font color="#483d8b">Henry
VIII </font>abolished the teaching of canon law at <font color="#8b0000">Oxford
and Cambridge </font><font color="#191970">Universities</font>;
thereafter, ecclesiastical court employees received a civil law
education leading to a doctorate in civil law at Oxford or a
doctorate in law at Cambridge. Such lawyers (called 'doctors' and
'civilians') were concentrated in the 'Doctors Commons', a few
streets south of St Paul's Cathedral in London, where they dealt
exclusively with succession, matrimonial and maritime matters until
their jurisdiction was transferred to the common law courts in the

approach to urban renewal in its future projects, including the
construction of the Government Centre. In 1965, the first community
health centre in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center,
opened <font color="#dcdcdc">in Dorchester.</font> It primarily
served the adjacent massive Columbia Point public housing complex,
which had been built in 1953. The health center is still in operation
and was reopened in 1990 as the <font color="#2f4f4f">Geiger-Gibson
Community Health Center</font>. The Columbia Point housing complex
was redeveloped and revitalised as the Harbor Point Apartments
mixed-income community between 1984 and 1990. By the 1970s, the
city's economy was booming after 30 years of economic decline. During
this period, a large number of apartment buildings were built in the
Financial District and Boston's Back Bay. This boom lasted until the
mid-1980s and later resumed. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General
Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and
Women's Hospital are among the nation's leaders in medical innovation
and patient care. Schools such as Boston College, Boston University,
Harvard Medical School, Northeastern University, Wentworth Institute
of Technology, Berklee College of Music and the Boston Conservatory
of Music attract students to the area. However, starting in 1974, the
city experienced conflicts over the desegregation of bus service,
which led to unrest and violence around public schools throughout the
mid-1970s.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Soon Laemmle and other disgruntled
nickel hall owners decided to avoid paying Edison <font color="#a9a9a9">by

Moving Pictures Company </font>(IMP), with studios in <font color="#a0522d">Fort
Lee, New Jersey</font>, where many of the first films of the first
American film industry were produced in the early 1900s. Laemmle
broke Edison's custom of refusing to give performers billing and
filming rights. By appointing movie stars, he attracted many of the
leading actors of his day, thus contributing to the emergence of the
star system. In 1910, he promoted Florence Lawrence, formerly known
as '<font color="#228b22">The Biograph Girl', </font>and the actress
<font color="#191970">King Baggot, in </font>what may have been the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Despite Laemmle's role as an
innovator, he was an extremely cautious studio manager. Unlike his
competitors <font color="#a9a9a9">Adolph Zukor, William Fox and
Marcus Loew</font>, Laemmle was not interested in developing a
theatre chain. He also financed all his films himself and refused to
take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when
actor-director <font color="#dcdcdc">Erich von Stroheim </font>demanded
exorbitantly lavish production values for his films Blind Husbands
(<font color="#2f4f4f">1919</font>) and Foolish Wives ()1922 , but
Universal wisely recouped some of the costs by launching a
sensational advertising campaign to attract people to the films.
Character actor <font color="#6b8e23">Lon Chaney </font>became a draw
for Universal in the 1920s, appearing steadily in dramas. His two
biggest successes for Universal were The Hunchback of Notre Dame
(<font color="#a0522d">1923</font>) and The Phantom of the Opera
(1925). During this period, Laemmle entrusted most of his production
decisions <font color="#228b22">to Irving Thalberg</font>. Thalberg
had served as Laemmle's personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed
by his convincing observations on how to run the studio effectively.
Thalberg, promoted to studio chief, was about to give Universal's
product a touch of style, but MGM's production manager Louis B. Mayer
lured Thalberg away from Universal with the promise of a better
salary. Without his direction, Universal became a second-rate studio,
and remained so for several decades.</p>

were distributed by other independent foreign language distributors

production facility, and made several ventures into high-end
production. Among his first efforts were a critically panned, partly
sound film version of Edna Ferber's novel <font color="#dcdcdc">Show

which began production in late 1935, and unlike the 1929 film was
based on a Broadway musical rather than a novel. Carl Jr's spending
habits worried the company's shareholders. They would not allow

is the most commonly used strategy today, with one advantage being
the chemical reaction with lignin, which produces heat that can be
used to drive a generator. Most pulp mills that use the power process
are net producers of electricity from the grid or use electricity to
power an adjacent paper mill. Another advantage is that the process
recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reactants. <font color="#6b8e23">Soda

thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and <font color="#a9a9a9">groundwood pulp
</font>(GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into
large steam-heated processing machines where the chips are compressed
and converted into fibres between two steel plates. In the

fed into <font color="#6b8e23">grinding machines where they are

fibres. The mechanical pulping process does not remove lignin, so the
yield is very high, over 95%, but the paper produced will yellow and
become brittle over time. The fibres in mechanical pulp are quite
short, so they produce <font color="#228b22">weak </font>paper.

mainstream music, but they do not play <font color="#a9a9a9">hip hop</font>,
dance songs, hard rock and some forms of teen pop because they are
less popular with their target audience of adults. AC radio is often
aimed at the 25-44 age group, which has received the most attention

years, it is common practice for many adult contemporary music
stations to play less <font color="#556b2f">newer music </font>because

90% instrumental tracks, and a few were entirely instrumental. The
easy listening format, as it was first known, was born out of the
desire of some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to
continue playing today's hit songs but to distinguish themselves from
being labelled as &quot;rock and roll&quot; stations. Billboard first
published the Easy Listening list on <font color="#556b2f">17 July

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">One big impetus for the development

ambient. While most easy listening music was <font color="#dcdcdc">instrumental

more and more AC stations are being forced to change is that <font color="#a9a9a9">less

daylight saving time, often dividing daylight into twelve hours

was longer in summer. For example, Roman <font color="#a9a9a9">water
clocks </font>had different scales for different seasons: at Roman
latitude, the third hour of sunrise, the <font color="#dcdcdc">hora
tertia, </font>began at 09.02 by modern standards and lasted 44
minutes at winter solstice, but at summer solstice it began at 06.58
and lasted one minute75. After antiquity, civil hours of equal length
eventually superseded unequal ones, so that civil time no longer
varies according to the seasons. The unequal hours are still used in

</font>a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a
two-hour daylight saving time change, and after considerable interest
was shown in Christchurch, he followed this up in a paper published
in 1898. In many publications, the proposal for daylight saving time
is associated with the eminent English builder and outdoor enthusiast
<font color="#556b2f">William Willett, </font>who independently
conceived of daylight saving time in 1905 during a pre-breakfast
drive, when he was dismayed to discover how many Londoners slept for
much of the summer day. He was a keen golfer and didn't like the idea
of having to stop his round at dusk. His solution was to bring
forward the clock in the summer months, and he published his proposal
two years later. <font color="#6b8e23">Robert Pearce, a </font>Liberal
MP, <font color="#6b8e23">took up the </font>proposal and introduced
the first Daylight Saving Time Bill in the House of Commons on 12
February 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue,
but Pearce's bill failed to become law, and several other bills
failed in the years that followed. Willett lobbied for the proposal
in the UK until his death in 1915.</p>

wake up and go to work earlier in the summer, and ordered District of
Columbia federal employees to start work at 8:00 a.m. instead of 9:00

is primarily based on its impact on domestic lighting, which consumes
about <font color="#a9a9a9">3.5% </font>of electricity in the US and

artificial lighting use in the evening and increase it in <font color="#dcdcdc">the

are reduced if the reduction in the evening is greater than the
increase in the morning, as in high latitudes in summer when most

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The content of the legislation, in
particular Section 1(1) of the 1938 Amendment Act, shows that at that
time it was considered important that architects should be given
responsibility for supervising or directing the construction work
(housing and other projects) of municipalities, and not just persons
with the professional qualifications of municipal or other engineers.
By the 1970s, another issue had arisen concerning training for
architectural qualifications and registration to practise as an
architect, as the UK and other European governments were required to
comply with <font color="#a9a9a9">European Union </font>directives on
the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, aimed at
ensuring equal standards across borders to promote the European
Union's single market policy. This led to proposals to re-establish
ARCUK. Eventually, in the 1990s, the Government published a
consultation document, Reform of Architects Registration (1994),
ahead of further action. Changing the name <font color="#dcdcdc">to
the Architects Registration Board </font>was one of the proposals
subsequently incorporated into <font color="#2f4f4f">the Housing
Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act </font>and <font color="#556b2f">reintroduced
in 1996 </font>as the Architects Act 1997; another proposal was to

adults have additional paid employment, either in government service

fishing and go to sea in good weather. The nominal fishing season

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The population of the islands is
<font color="#a9a9a9">301</font>. The main settlement is <font color="#dcdcdc">Edinburgh
of the Seven Seas </font>(known locally as &quot;The Settlement&quot;).
The only religion is Christianity, with Anglican and Roman Catholic
denominations. The current population is believed to be descended
from 15 ancestors, eight men and seven women, who arrived on the
island at different times between 1816 and 1908. The male founding
fathers came from <font color="#2f4f4f">Scotland, England, the
Netherlands, the United States and Italy and </font>belonged to three
Y haplogroups: I (M170), R-SRY10831.2 and R (M207) (xSRY10831.2),
sharing only eight surnames: Glass, Green, Hagan, Lavarello,
Patterson, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. The isolation of Tristan da
Cunha has led to an unusual, patois-style English dialect, described
by author Simon Winchester as &quot;a noisy mixture of Home Counties
lockjaw and 19th century idioms, Afrikaans slang and Italian&quot;.

listen; Chinese <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">南京</font>, <font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;southern
capital&quot;) is a </font>city on <font color="#2f4f4f">the lower
Yangtze River in China</font>, which has long been a major centre of
culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks
and tourism. It is the capital of Jiangsu Province in the People's
Republic of China and the second largest city in eastern China with a
population of 8,216,100. It is legally the capital of the Republic of
China, which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city, whose
name means &quot;southern capital&quot;, plays an important role in
Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of several
Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments from the 3rd
century AD until 1949. Before the introduction of pinyin
romanisation, the name of the city of Nanjing was spelled Nanking or
Nankin. Nanjing has several other names, and some historical names
are now used as district names, among them the name Jiangning (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">江寧</font>),
with the former character Jiang (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">江</font>,
river) being the former part of the name Jiangsu and the latter
character Ning (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">寧</font>, simplified
form <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">宁</font>, peace) being the
shortened name of Nanjing. In the case of the capital of a state,
such as the ROC, Jing (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">京</font>) is used
as an abbreviation for Nanjing. Although the city in the south of
China became the national capital of China during the <font color="#556b2f">Jin
Dynasty</font>, the name Nanjing was given to the city during <font color="#6b8e23">the
Ming Dynasty</font>, about 1,000 years later. Nanjing is known in
particular as Jinling (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">金陵</font>,
literally meaning Golden Mountain), and the old name has been used
since the Warring States of the Zhou Dynasty.</p>

Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen) that ruled southern China
successively from 317-589; The Southern Tang Dynasty, one of the Ten

China was ruled from a city (1368-1421); and the Republic of China
(1927-37, 1945-49) before fleeing to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil
War. The city was also home to the rebel Taiping Kingdom of Heaven
(1851-64) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940-45)
during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and suffered horrific atrocities
in both conflicts, including the Nanjing Massacre. It has served as

</font>2013, a dense wave of smog began in central and eastern China
over a distance of about 1 200 km, including Tianjin, Hebei,
Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. The lack of cold
airflow combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial
emissions collected air pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over
the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted the central and southern
parts of Jiangsu province, especially Nanjing and its surroundings,
with an AQI pollution index of &quot;highly polluted&quot; <font color="#dcdcdc">for
five consecutive days </font>and &quot;very polluted&quot; for nine

December, </font>Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and

Outpatient services at the children's hospital increased by 33%; the
overall incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia and upper respiratory
tract infections increased significantly. The smog lifted on 12
December. Authorities blamed the dense pollution on a lack of wind,
exhaust emissions from cars in low-pressure conditions and a
coal-fired district heating system in northern China. Prevailing
winds blew low-level air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2)
towards the east coast of China.</p>

considerable success on the pitch and even financial success, many
teams in the history of the league have enjoyed little success either
on or off the pitch. There are several <font color="#2f4f4f">franchises</font>
that have existed as multiple, largely unrelated teams under multiple

whose owners sold the team and turned it into the <font color="#556b2f">Toronto
</font>Phantoms, which became the Toronto Phantoms, which lasted two
more seasons until it went out of business). There are several
reasons for the failure of these teams, including financially weak
ownership groups, a lack of deep financial support from some owners
who could otherwise provide it, a lack of media exposure, and an
apparent lack of interest by the host city in their team or the sport

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The year 2000 saw an increased
interest in the AFL. Then-St<font color="#a9a9a9">. Louis Rams
</font>quarterback Kurt Warner, who was the MVP of <font color="#dcdcdc">Super
Bowl XXXIV</font>, was the first to be noticed because he played
quarterback for the AFL's <font color="#2f4f4f">Iowa Barnstormers</font>.
While many sports commentators and fans continued to mock the league,
Warner's story gave the league positive visibility and earned the
league a new television contract with <font color="#556b2f">TNN</font>,
which, unlike ESPN, broadcast live regular season games. While not
financially lucrative, it helped lay the groundwork for what the
league would become in the new millennium. The year also saw the
launch of a minor league, AF2, which was intended to be a development
league similar to the National Football League's NFL Europe. The
2000s saw much expansion. Expansion teams included the Austin
Wranglers, Carolina Cobras, Los Angeles Avengers, Chicago Rush,
Detroit Fury, Dallas Desperados, Colorado Crush, New Orleans <font color="#6b8e23">VooDoo</font>,
Philadelphia Soul, Nashville Kats, Kansas City Brigade, New York
Dragons and Utah Blaze. Some of these teams, such as the Crush,
Desperados, Kats and VooDoo, were owned by the same group that owned
the NFL teams in their host cities. The NFL bought, but never
exercised, the option to buy a significant stake in the AFL. Of all
these teams, only Seoul still competes in the AFL.</p>

the Voodoo, the identity of the Voodoo formerly owned by New Orleans
Saints owner Tom Benson. The Alabama Vipers moved to Duluth, Georgia,

a continuation of the first Nashville Kats franchise). On October 25,

contract with NBC to televise league matches, which was extended for
two years in 2005. At the same time, the league moved the start of
the season <font color="#a9a9a9">from May </font><font color="#dcdcdc">to

of its games <font color="#2f4f4f">on Sunday </font>rather than

2006, because of the XX Winter Olympics, the Stanley Cup playoffs and

committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th ArenaBowl.
NBC and the Arena Football League officially parted ways <font color="#6b8e23">on

the deal failed because ESPN refused to show highlights or even

languages of </font><font color="#556b2f">Italy</font><font color="#2f4f4f">,
</font>often colloquially referred to as 'dialects' of Italian, are
not in fact derived from the current standard Italian language, but
have developed separately from each other and independently of
standard Italian, long before the national standard language spread
throughout the territory of present-day Italy. These various regional
languages derived from Latin are therefore not 'dialects' of the
standard Italian language in a linguistic sense, but are better
defined as separate languages in their own right. On the other hand,
as the <font color="#a0522d">standard Italian language </font>spread
throughout Italy in the 20th century, different regional versions or
variants of the standard Italian language developed, usually a
mixture of national standard Italian and local regional languages and
accents. These variants of <font color="#228b22">Standard Italian</font>,
called <font color="#191970">regional Italian, </font>would be more
appropriately called 'dialects' according to the first linguistic
definition, since they are in fact derived in part or in large part
from Standard Italian.

are subject to the same authority in some linguistic matters. For
example, to find out the name of a new invention or an unknown

Although the Italian regional languages are mostly unintelligible to
each other, their exact degree of mutual unintelligibility varies and
often correlates with the geographical distance or geographical
barriers between the languages, as some Italian regional languages
that are geographically closer to each other or closer to each other
along the dialectal continuum are more or less intelligible to each
other. For example, a speaker of pure East Lombardy, a language
spoken in the <font color="#556b2f">Lombardy </font><font color="#2f4f4f">region
of northern Italy</font>, which includes the Bergamo dialect, would
have very little mutual intelligibility with a speaker of pure
Italian, and a speaker of pure Sicilian would have almost no mutual
intelligibility with a speaker of Sicilian. In fact, since East
Lombardy is a <font color="#6b8e23">Gallic-Italian </font>language, a
speaker of East Lombardy may be more intelligible to a speaker of
Occitan, Catalan or French than to a speaker of ordinary Italian or
Sicilian. A speaker of Sicilian, on the other hand, would be better
understood <font color="#228b22">by a speaker of a language more
closely related to </font>Sicilian, <font color="#191970">Naples, </font>but

Chinese characters have evolved <font color="#dcdcdc">from logograms</font>,
which do not always give clues about pronunciation. Although written
characters have remained relatively consistent over the past two
thousand years, pronunciation and grammar have evolved so much in
different regions that spoken versions of the language are often
incomprehensible to each other. Due to historical migration <font color="#2f4f4f">to
the south</font>, southern regional languages such as Xiang, Wu, Gan,

have traces of Old Chinese or Central Chinese. Since the Ming

China, and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the greatest

was developed so that the languages of Western civilisation would
function as its dialects. Drawing on concepts such as the

that modern Western languages were in fact dialects of a hidden or
latent language. Researchers at the <font color="#2f4f4f">International

that they considered to be part of the Interlingua vocabulary. In
theory, speakers of Western languages would understand written or
spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, because their
own languages were dialects of it. This has often been shown to be
true, especially, but not only, for speakers of Romance languages and
educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to be

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The etymology of Bern's name is
uncertain. According to a local legend based on folk etymology, Duke
Berchtold V of Zähringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to
name the city after the first animal he met in the forest, which
turned out to <font color="#a9a9a9">be a bear.</font> It has long
been thought likely that the town was named after the Italian town of
Verona, then known in Middle High German as Bern. Following the
discovery of a zinc tablet in Bern in the 1980s, it is now more
commonly assumed that the town was named after a pre-existing toponym
of Celtic origin, possibly *berna 'log'. The bear was the heraldic
animal on the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s
onwards. The earliest mention of live <font color="#dcdcdc">bears </font>in
Bärengraben dates from <font color="#2f4f4f">the 1440s.</font></p>

times, on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, there was a
Celtic oppidum, fortified from the 2nd century BC (late La Tène
period), which is believed to be one of the twelve oppidums of Hell
mentioned by Caesar. <font color="#dcdcdc">In the Roman period, the

confiscated assets corruptly acquired by the previous government.
This encouraged officials to hide their assets abroad, where they

making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without
bribes. Bribes may be required to get a public official to do
something for which he or she is already being paid. Bribes can also
be demanded to circumvent laws and regulations. In addition to being
used for private financial gain, bribes are also used deliberately

</font>trading is when a person sells his or her influence in the

in some cases he may be <font color="#2f4f4f">an accomplice.</font>
It may be difficult to distinguish between this form of corruption
and some extreme and loosely regulated forms of lobbying, where, for
example, legislators or policy-makers are free to 'sell' their votes,
decision-making power or influence to the lobbyists who offer the
highest remuneration, even when the latter act on behalf of their

adoption of certain environmental, social or other regulations

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There are <font color="#a9a9a9">two
</font>ways of corruption in the judiciary: the state (through
budgetary planning and various privileges) and the private. In many
transitional and developing countries, the <font color="#dcdcdc">judiciary's
</font>budget is almost entirely controlled by the <font color="#2f4f4f">executive.
</font>The latter undermines the <font color="#556b2f">separation of
powers </font>because it creates a critical financial dependency for
the judiciary. The proper distribution of national wealth, including
state expenditure on the judiciary, is a matter of constitutional
economics. Corruption in the judiciary can be difficult to eradicate
completely, even in developed countries.</p>
