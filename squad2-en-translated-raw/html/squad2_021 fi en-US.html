British Raj and remained so for 150 years, with the city as its
capital. The influence of the Nizams can still be seen in the Muslim
culture of Hyderabad. The city continued to serve as the capital of
the state of Hyderabad after its annexation to the Indian Union in
1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the 1956
Reorganisation of States Act. Since 1956, the Rashtrapati Nilayam in
the city has been the winter residence of the President of India. In
2014, the newly created state of Telangana seceded from Andhra
Pradesh and the city became the joint capital of both states, with
the transitional arrangement due to end by 2025.</p>

author of the Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names,
Hyderabad means <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;Haydar city&quot; or
&quot;lion city&quot;</font>, from haydar (lion) and ābād (city).
It was named in honour of <font color="#dcdcdc">Caliph Ali Ibn Abi
Talib</font>, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like prowess
in battle. Andrew Petersen, a scholar of Islamic architecture, says
the original name of the city was <font color="#2f4f4f">Baghnagar
(City of Gardens). </font>According to one popular theory, the city's
founder, <font color="#556b2f">Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, </font>named
the city <font color="#6b8e23">'Bhagyanagar' or 'Bhāgnagar' after
Bhagmat, a local nautch girl (dancing girl) </font>with whom he was
in love. He converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal. The
city was renamed Hyderabad in his honour. According to another
source, the city was named after Quli Qutb Shah's son Haidar.</p>

with Hyderabad city as its capital. In his 1955 report Thoughts on
Linguistic States, the then Chairman of the Constitution Drafting
Committee of India, B.R. Ambedkar, proposed that Hyderabad be
designated as the second capital of India because of its convenience
and strategic central location. Since 1956, the Rashtrapati Nilayam
in Hyderabad has been the second official residence and office of the
President of India, who stays there once a year during the winter and

burns off the haze by noon. In late winter/early summer, daily fog is
also a phenomenon. It occurs suddenly and can last for a few hours or
after sunset. Nevertheless, in June it is sometimes cloudy and cool
all day, although the rest of the Los Angeles area is sunny and
warmer. Sometimes the sun can shine on the east side of 20th Street,
while the coastal area is cloudy. In general, the beach is <font color="#8b0000">5-10
</font><font color="#483d8b">degrees Fahrenheit </font>(3-6 degrees
Celsius) cooler than inland on summer days and 5-10 degrees warmer on
winter nights.</p>

university after the nation's first president just seven years before
the American Civil War and at a time of national division was no

&quot;deep somatic&quot; and &quot;superficial somatic&quot; pain.
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">Visceral </font>structures are highly
sensitive to stretching, ischemia and inflammation, but relatively
insensitive to other stimuli that normally cause pain in other
structures, such as burning and cutting. Visceral pain is diffuse,
difficult to localise and often focused on a distant, usually
superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by <font color="#6b8e23">nausea
and vomiting and </font>can be described as nauseating, deep,
clenching and dull. <font color="#a0522d">Deep somatic </font>pain is
caused <font color="#228b22">by stimulation of nociceptors in
</font>ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fasciae and muscles

is caused <font color="#483d8b">by activation of nociceptors in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In <font color="#a9a9a9">1644, </font><font color="#dcdcdc">René
Descartes </font>theorized that pain was a <font color="#2f4f4f">disturbance
that </font><font color="#556b2f">traveled along nerve fibers until
the disturbance reached the brain, </font>transforming the perception
of pain from a spiritual, mystical experience into a physical,
mechanical sensation[citation needed]<font color="#a9a9a9">.
</font>Descartes' work, along with that of Avicenna, foreshadowed the
development of 19th century special theory. Specificity theory saw
pain as &quot;a specific sensation with its own sensory apparatus,
independent of touch and other senses&quot;. Another theory that
emerged in the 17th and 19th centuries was the intensity theory,
which did not consider pain as a unique sensory modality but as an
emotional state induced by stimuli that were more intense than
normal, such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the
mid-1890s, <font color="#191970">the specific </font>theory <font color="#191970">was
mainly advocated by physiologists and doctors</font>, and the
intensive theory mainly by psychologists. However, after the <font color="#8b0000">clinical
observations of </font>Henry Head and the experiments of Max von
Frey, <font color="#483d8b">psychologists </font>almost massively
shifted towards specificity, and by the end of the century most

Melzack and Kenneth Casey </font>described pain in terms of its <font color="#dcdcdc">three
</font>dimensions: 'sensory-discriminative' (sensing the intensity,
location, quality and duration of pain), 'affective-motivational'
(discomfort and the <font color="#2f4f4f">desire to escape
discomfort</font>) and 'cognitive-evaluative' (cognitions such as
appraisal, cultural values, distractions and hypnotic suggestion).
According to their theory, pain intensity (sensory-discriminative
dimension) and unpleasantness (affective-motivational dimension) are
not determined solely by the magnitude of the painful stimulus, but
&quot;higher&quot; <font color="#556b2f">cognitive functions </font>may
influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness. Cognitive functions
&quot;may affect both sensory and affective experience, or they may
alter the primarily affective-motivational dimension. Thus,
excitement in games or war seems to inhibit both <font color="#6b8e23">dimensions
of </font>pain, whereas suggestion and placebo may modulate the
affective-motivational dimension and leave the sensory-discriminative
dimension relatively unaffected.&quot; (p. 432) The paper concludes
with <font color="#a0522d">a call to </font><font color="#228b22">action</font>:

</font><font color="#2f4f4f">Richard Dawkins asks </font>why pain
must be so painful. He describes the alternative as a simple, mental
&quot;red flag&quot; raising. To justify why that red flag might not
be enough, Dawkins explains that living things have to compete with
<font color="#556b2f">each other. The </font>most suitable creature
would be one <font color="#6b8e23">whose pains are well balanced</font>.
Those pains that spell certain death if ignored will be experienced
most intensely. The relative intensity of pain may therefore resemble
the relative importance of that <font color="#a0522d">risk </font>for
our ancestors (lack of food, too cold or severe injuries are
experienced as pain, while minor injuries are experienced as mere
discomfort). This resemblance is not perfect, however, because
natural selection can be a <font color="#228b22">poor </font>designer.
The result is often <font color="#191970">disturbances in animals</font>,
including supernormal stimuli. Such perturbations help explain pain

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The most reliable method of
assessing pain in most people is <font color="#a9a9a9">by asking</font>:
a person can report pain that cannot be detected by any known
physiological measure. However, animals cannot answer questions about
<font color="#2f4f4f">whether they feel pain, </font>like infants
(infans means &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">cannot speak&quot;), </font>so
the criterion that defines human pain cannot be applied to them.
Philosophers and scientists have responded to this problem in many
different ways. For example, René Descartes argued <font color="#556b2f">that
animals have no </font><font color="#6b8e23">consciousness and
</font><font color="#556b2f">therefore do not experience pain and
suffering </font>in<font color="#556b2f"> the same way as humans.
</font>Bernard Rollin <font color="#a0522d">of Colorado State
University</font>, who is the lead author of two US federal laws
regulating pain relief for animals, writes that <font color="#228b22">even
in the 1980s scientists were uncertain whether animals experienced
pain, </font>and that in the US before 1989, trained veterinarians
were simply taught to ignore animal pain. When dealing with
scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to &quot;prove&quot;
that animals were conscious and to provide &quot;scientifically
acceptable&quot; reasons for the claim that animals felt pain.
Carbone writes that the <font color="#191970">view that animals feel
pain differently is now in the minority</font>. Academic reviews on
the subject are less clear, noting that while there is strong support
for the claim that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts
and feelings, some critics continue to question how reliably animal
states of mind can be determined. The ability of invertebrate species

General-purpose database systems try to meet the needs of as many

</font>first proposed a relational model in 1970 that departed from
this tradition by insisting that applications should search for
information <font color="#dcdcdc">by content </font>rather than by
following links. The relational model consists of a set of
ledger-type tables, each of which is used for different types of
entities. Only in the mid-1980s did computer hardware become powerful
enough to allow the widespread adoption of relational systems
(database systems and applications). By the early <font color="#556b2f">1990s,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In this article, he described a new
system for storing and processing large databases. Instead of storing
records in some kind of linked list of free-form records, as in
CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a &quot;table&quot; of records of
fixed length, where each table would be used for different types of
entities. <font color="#dcdcdc">A system of linked lists </font>would
be very inefficient for storing &quot;sparse&quot; databases, where
some of the record data could be left blank. The relational model
solved this by splitting the data into a number of normalised tables
(or relations), with optional elements being moved away from the main
table where they took up space only when needed. Data can be added,
deleted and edited freely in these tables, and the <font color="#556b2f">database
system </font>does all the necessary maintenance to present the table
view to the application/user.</p>

the content of the database to evolve <font color="#a9a9a9">without

relational part comes from the fact that entities refer to other
entities in so-called one-to-many relationships, as in the
traditional hierarchical model, and in many-to-many relationships, as
in the navigation model (online). The relational model can therefore
express both hierarchical and navigational models, as well as its own
tabular model, allowing the three models to be modelled alone or in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the 1990s, as <font color="#a9a9a9">object-oriented
</font>programming became more widespread, the way in which data from
different databases were processed increased. Programmers and
designers began to treat database data as objects. In other words, if
a database contained information about a person, his or her
attributes, such as address, phone number and age, were now
considered to belong to that person, rather than being extraneous
information. This allows relationships between data to be
relationships between objects and their attributes rather than
individual fields. The term &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">object-relational
impedance mismatch</font>&quot; described the difficulties of
translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object
databases and olio-relational databases attempt to solve this problem
by providing <font color="#2f4f4f">an object-oriented language
</font>(sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as
an alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Database storage is the storage of
<font color="#a9a9a9">the physical data in a database</font>. It
constitutes the internal (physical) layer of the database
architecture. It also contains all the necessary information (e.g.
metadata, &quot;data about data&quot; and internal data structures)
to reconstruct the conceptual layer and the external layer from the
internal layer, if necessary. The storage of data in persistent
storage is usually the responsibility of <font color="#dcdcdc">the
database engine, the </font>'storage engine'. Although a database
system usually accesses the database system through its underlying
operating system (and often uses the operating systems' file systems
as proxies for storage placement), the <font color="#2f4f4f">storage
properties and configuration settings </font>are very important for
the efficient operation of the database system, and are therefore
closely managed by the database administrators. A database system
always has a database in <font color="#556b2f">several different
storage types </font>(e.g. in-memory and external storage) when it is
operational. The database data and the necessary additional
information, which can be very large in number, are encoded <font color="#6b8e23">in
bits.</font> The data typically resides in storage in structures that
look completely different from the conceptual and external layers,
but in ways that aim to optimise (as much as possible) the
reconstruction of these layers when needed by users and programs, and
when computing additional types of required information from the data
(e.g. for database queries).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Between 1877 and 1878, there were
several <font color="#a9a9a9">stagecoach robberies in the </font>area.
The most notable, however, were two robberies by a masked road agent,
<font color="#dcdcdc">William Whitney Brazelton.</font> Brazelton
robbed two wagons in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain
Station, about 27 miles northwest of Tucson. John Clum, of Tombstone,
Arizona, was one of the passengers. Brazelton was tracked down and
killed on Monday, <font color="#2f4f4f">August 19, 1878, </font>at
Mesquite Bosque on the Santa Cruz River, five miles south of Tucson,
by <font color="#556b2f">Pima County Sheriff </font><font color="#6b8e23">Charles
A. Shibell </font><font color="#a0522d">and his posse of citizens.</font>
Brazelton was suspected of highway robberies not only in the Tucson
area, but also in the Prescott area and the Silver City area of New
Mexico. Brazelton's crimes prompted Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.'s John J.
Valentine Sr. to send a special agent and incoming Pima County
Sheriff Bob Paul to investigate. Fort Lowell, east of Tucson, was
established to protect settlers from Apache attacks. In 1882, Cowboy
Pete Spence's wife Marietta accused <font color="#228b22">Frank
Stilwell </font>of murdering Morgan Earp in the coroner's inquest
into the shooting of Morgan Earp. The coroner's jury concluded that
Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode and Florentino &quot;Indian Charlie&quot;
Cruz were the prime suspects in the murder of Morgan Earp. :250 <font color="#191970">US
Deputy </font><font color="#8b0000">Wyatt Earp </font>gathered a few
trusted friends and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family on a train
trip to Benson, California. They found Stilwell ambushing Virgil at
the Tucson station and killed him on the tracks. After killing
Stilwell, Wyatt hired other deputy leaders and rode out on a revenge
ride, where he killed three more cowboys over the next few days
before leaving the state.</p>

the remains of the historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of
Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In <font color="#a9a9a9">1891, </font>Fort
Lowell was abandoned, much of its interior stripped of usable parts,
and quickly fell into disrepair. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1900, </font>three
officer's quarters were purchased for use <font color="#2f4f4f">as a
sanitarium</font>. The sanctuary was subsequently sold <font color="#556b2f">to

family, Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius, </font>purchased and restored
the fort's remaining adobe buildings - transforming them into
spectacular artistic examples of Southwestern architecture. Their
woodworking, plasterworking and sense of proportion drew on their

academics of the mid-20th century, including Win Ellis, Jack Maul,
Madame Cheruy, Giorgio Belloli, Charels Bode, Veronica Hughart,
Edward and Rosamond Spicer, Hazel Larson Archer and Ruth Brown
renovated adobe houses, built homes and lived in the area. The

voluntary, partially publicly funded campaigns. Since 1985, both
mayoral and city council candidates have been able to receive
matching public funding from the city<font color="#a9a9a9">. </font>To

ground-mounted solar photovoltaic system and a 2.7 MW rooftop solar
photovoltaic system, both located in the base's residential area. The
base will soon have the largest solar energy generation capacity in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Agriculture accounted for less than
20% of both net material product and total employment before the

importance of agriculture in the economy increased significantly,
reaching over 30% of GDP and over <font color="#dcdcdc">40% of </font>total
employment by the end of the 1990s. The increase in the importance of
agriculture was due to the <font color="#2f4f4f">food security needs
of the </font>population as a result of the uncertainty in the early
transition period and the collapse of the non-agricultural sectors of
the economy in the early 1990s. As the economic situation stabilised

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Like the other NIS of the former
Soviet Union, Armenia's economy is suffering from the disintegration
of the former Soviet trade models. Soviet investment and support for
Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, leaving few large
companies still able to operate. In addition, the effects of the <font color="#a9a9a9">1988
</font>Spitak earthquake, which killed <font color="#dcdcdc">more

felt. The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been
resolved. The closure of the Azerbaijani-Turkish border has
devastated the economy, as Armenia is dependent on external supplies
of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Georgia and
Iran are inadequate or unreliable. Gross domestic product fell by
almost <font color="#2f4f4f">60% </font>between 1989 and 1993, but

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The ancestors of modern bacteria
were single-celled micro-organisms, the first life forms to appear on
Earth around <font color="#a9a9a9">4 billion years ago</font>. For
about 3 billion years, <font color="#dcdcdc">most organisms were
microscopic, </font>and bacteria and archaeological organisms were
the dominant life forms. In 2008, fossils of macro-organisms were
discovered and named the Francevillian biota. Although <font color="#2f4f4f">bacterial
fossils </font>such as stromatolites exist, their lack of distinctive
morphology prevents their use to study the evolutionary history of
bacteria or to determine the time of origin of a particular bacterial
species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the
phylogeny of bacteria, and these studies indicate that bacteria first
diverged from <font color="#556b2f">the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage.</font>
Bacteria were also involved in another major evolutionary divergence,
the archaeal/eukaryotic divergence. In this case, eukaryotes arose
when ancient bacteria entered into endosymbiotic associations with
ancestral eukaryotic cells that were themselves possibly related to
archaea. This involved the adoption of alphaproteobacterial symbionts
in proto-eukaryotic cells to form either mitochondria or
hydrogenosomes, which are still present in all known eukaryotic cells
(sometimes in a very reduced form, e.g. in ancient 'amitochondrial'
protozoa). Later, some eukaryotes, which already contained
<font color="#6b8e23">mitochondria, also ingested </font>cyanobacteria-like<font color="#6b8e23">
organisms.</font> This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae
and plants. There are also some algae that originate from even later
endosymbiotic events. In this case, eukaryotes ingested a eukaryotic
alga, which evolved into a &quot;second generation&quot; plastid.
This is called secondary endosymbiosis.</p>

In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall

<font color="#dcdcdc">Lipopolysaccharides</font>, also called
endotoxins, are composed of <font color="#2f4f4f">polysaccharides and

gram-positive bacteria and is not effective against gram-negative

If the bacterial cell wall is completely removed, it is called a

to the nutrient-rich environment and prepare for rapid growth. During
the lag phase, the rate of biosynthesis is high as the proteins

log phase, also known as the logarithmic or exponential phase. The
log phase is characterised by <font color="#2f4f4f">rapid exponential
growth</font>. The rate at which cells grow in this phase is called
the growth rate (k) and the time it takes for cells to double is
called the generation time (g). During the log phase, nutrients are
metabolized at the highest rate until one of the nutrients runs out
and starts to limit growth. The third growth phase is the <font color="#556b2f">stationary

metabolic activity and consume the cell's non-essential proteins. In
the stationary phase, there is a transition from rapid growth to a

development of the anti-aircraft battery required an <font color="#a9a9a9">electronic
circuit that could withstand cannon fire and could be produced in
large quantities</font>. The <font color="#dcdcdc">Globe Union's
</font>Centralab Division came up with a proposal that met the
requirements: <font color="#2f4f4f">a ceramic </font>plate would be
screen-printed with metallic ink as conductors and carbon material as
resistors, and ceramic plate capacitors and undersized vacuum tubes
would be soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and a patent
for the process, which had been classified by the US Army, was
granted to the Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded <font color="#6b8e23">Harry

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Originally, each electronic
component had <font color="#a9a9a9">conductors, </font>and holes were
drilled in the circuit board for the conductors of each component.
The components' leads were then routed through the holes and soldered
to the circuit board. This assembly method is called through-hole
construction. In 1949, <font color="#556b2f">Moe Abramson and
Stanislaus F. Danko </font>of the US Army Signal Corps developed an
automated assembly process in which the component leads were inserted
into a copper foil connection pattern and soldered. Their <font color="#6b8e23">1956
</font>patent was awarded to <font color="#a0522d">the US Army.</font>
As board lamination and etching techniques developed, this concept
evolved into the circuit board manufacturing process we use today.
Soldering could be done automatically by passing the circuit board
over a wave of molten solder, the wave, in <font color="#228b22">a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Homer mentions the &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Hellenes&quot;
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">(/ˈhɛliːnz/) as a relatively small
tribe that settled in Phtia in Thessaly and </font>whose warriors
were under the command of Achilles. According to the Parian
Chronicle, Phtia was the homeland of the Hellenes and this name was
given to those formerly called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek
mythology, <font color="#2f4f4f">Hellen, the patriarch of the
Hellenes</font>, <font color="#556b2f">was the son of </font><font color="#6b8e23">Pyrrha
and Deucalion</font><font color="#556b2f">, who ruled around Phthia,
the only survivors after the Great Flood.</font> It seems that the
myth was invented when Greek tribes began to diverge in certain Greek
regions, and it shows their common origin. Aristotle identifies
ancient Hellas as the area between the Dodona and the Akelous rivers
in Epirus, where the Great Flood of Deucalion occurred, and inhabited
by the Cellians and 'Greeks', who later became known as 'Hellenes'.
The Selloi were priests of Zeus of Dodonia, and the word probably
means 'sacrificers' (cf. Gothic saljan, 'present, sacrifice'). There
is currently no satisfactory etymology for the name Hellenes. Some
scholars claim that the name Selloi became Sellanes and then
Hellanes-Hellenes. However, this etymology links the name Hellenes to
the Doorites who occupied the Epirus, and the relationship with the
name Greeks given by the Romans is uncertain. <font color="#a0522d">The
name Hellenes seems to be older, and the Greeks probably used it in
connection with the establishment of the Great Amphictite League.
This was an </font>ancient Greek tribal confederation <font color="#228b22">with

protect the great temples of Apollo at Delphi (Phocis) and the temple

Aristotle states that the Hellenes were related to the Grai/Greeks
(Meteorologica I.xiv), which was the original name of the Doric tribe
of Epirus used by the Illyrians. He also argues that the Great Flood
must have occurred around Dodona, where the Cellians lived. However,
according to Greek tradition, it is more likely that the Greeks'
homeland was originally in central Greece. <font color="#6b8e23">According
to modern theory, the name Greek (Lat. Graeci) comes from the word
Graikos, '</font><font color="#a0522d">inhabitant of Graia/Graea',

BC) in Italy, where they were called Graeci. When the Romans
encountered them, they used this name first for the colonists and
then for all Greeks (Graeci.) <font color="#228b22">The word </font><font color="#191970">γραῖα
graia &quot;old woman&quot; comes from the PIE root *ǵerh2-/*ǵreh2-,
&quot;to grow old&quot; </font><font color="#228b22">via the Proton

geras (/keras/), &quot;honorary Greek&quot; in Mycenaean Greek. The
Germanic languages borrowed the word Greek with the initial sound
&quot;k&quot;, which was probably their initial sound, closest at the
time to the Latin &quot;g&quot; (Gothic Kreks). The area outside
ancient Attica, which included Boeotia, was called Graïke, and is
associated with the older Flood of Ogyges, the mythological ruler of
Boeotia. The area was originally inhabited by the Minyans, who were
indigenous or proto-greek-speaking people. In Ancient Greek, the name
Ogygios meant 'from the earliest days'.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the Iliad, Homer uses the terms
<font color="#a9a9a9">Achaeans and Danaans </font>(Δαναοί) as a
generic term for the Greeks, and they were probably part of the
Mycenaean civilisation. The names Akhaioi and Danaoi seem to be
<font color="#dcdcdc">pre-doric, </font>belonging to a defeated
people. They were forced after the Doric invasion into the area that
later bore the name Achaia. In the 5th century BC they <font color="#2f4f4f">were
redefined as the modern speakers of Aeolian Greek</font>, <font color="#556b2f">spoken
mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos.</font> There are many
controversial theories about the origin of the Achaeans. According to
one view, the Achaeans were one of the light-skinned tribes of Upper
Europe who pushed over the Alps into southern Europe <font color="#a0522d">in
the Early Iron Age </font>(1300 BC). According to another theory, the
Achaeans were the Doorites of the Peloponnese. Other scholars reject
these theories and argue, on the basis of linguistic criteria, that
the Achaeans were continental Greeks who were pre-Doorish. There is
also a theory that there was an Acaean ethnos that migrated from Asia
Minor to the lower Thessaly before 2000 BC. Some Hittite texts
mention a people to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya. Egyptian
documents refer to the Ekwesh, one of the groups of maritime peoples
who settled in Egypt during the Merneptah (1213-1203 BC), who may
have been Achaeans.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In Homer's Iliad, the terms Danaans
(or danaoi: Δαναοί) and Argives (argives: Αργείοι) are
used to describe the Greek troops <font color="#a9a9a9">who resisted
the Trojans</font>. The myth of the Danaus, which originated in
<font color="#dcdcdc">Egypt</font>, is the founding legend of the
Argives. <font color="#2f4f4f">His daughter, Danaides, was forced in
Tartarus to </font><font color="#556b2f">carry a pitcher to fill a
bathtub that had no bottom</font>. This myth relates to a task that
can never be completed (Sisyphus), and the name can be derived from
the PIE root *danu: 'river'. There is no satisfactory theory of their
origin. Some scholars associate the Danaans with the Deneans, one of
the groups of Sea Peoples who invaded Egypt during the reign of
Ramesses III (1187-1156 BC). The same inscription mentions the
Weshesh, who may have been Achaeans. <font color="#6b8e23">The Denyen
</font>appear to have been inhabitants of the city of Adana in
Cilicia. Pottery resembling Mycenaean pottery has been found at
Tarsus in Cilicia, and it seems that some Aegean refugees went there
after the collapse of the Mycenaean civilisation. These Cilicians
seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi, who
invaded Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh), who
may have been Akeans. They were also called Danuna, according to the
Hittite inscription, and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna
letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-:
'flow, river', da:-nu: 'any moving liquid, drops', da:navo 'people
living along the river, skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda, water
demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek, Danaoi, in Egypt.

Hellenism was, from the beginning, above all a common culture, and
the national continuity of the Greek world is much more certain than
its demographic continuity. Yet Hellenism also included an ancestral
dimension through aspects of Athenian literature that developed and
influenced ideas of descent based on autochthony. In <font color="#228b22">the
later years of the </font><font color="#191970">Eastern Roman Empire,
</font>regions such as Ionia and Constantinople experienced a
Hellenistic revival based on language, philosophy and literature, and
classical models of thought and learning. This revival gave a strong
impetus to a sense of cultural connection with ancient Greece and its
classical heritage. The cultural changes experienced by the Greeks
are undeniable, despite the survival of a common ethnic identity. At
the same time, Greeks have <font color="#8b0000">retained their
language and alphabet, certain values and cultural traditions,
customs, a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion
</font>(the 13th century historian Anna Komnene used the word
barbarian to describe non-Greek-speaking Greek speakers), a sense of
Greek identity and a sense of common ethnicity despite the global
political and social changes of the last two millennia.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Roman Republic (Latin: Res
publica Romana; classical Latin: [ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na])
was a period of ancient Roman civilization that began <font color="#a9a9a9">with
the fall of the Roman Empire</font>, traditionally dated to <font color="#dcdcdc">509
BC </font>and ended in <font color="#2f4f4f">27 BC. </font>The Roman
Empire was founded in AD 509 BC. During this period, Rome's power
expanded from its periphery to become the hegemon of the entire
Mediterranean region. During the first two centuries, the Roman
Republic expanded through a combination of conquests and alliances
from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. In the following
century, it included North Africa, Spain and what is now southern
France. Two centuries later, at the end of the 1st century BC, it
included the rest of modern France, Greece and much of the eastern
Mediterranean. At this time, internal tensions led to several civil
wars, culminating in the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to
the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of this
transition may be open to interpretation. Historians have variously
suggested that Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, that
Caesar was appointed dictator for life in 44 BC and that Mark Antony
and Cleopatra were defeated at the Battle of Actium in <font color="#556b2f">31
BC. </font>However, most use the same date as the ancient Romans
themselves, namely that <font color="#6b8e23">the Roman Senate
granted Octavian extraordinary powers </font>and he took the title of
Augustus in 27 BC and that the Republic ended.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Rome was governed by two consuls,
elected annually by <font color="#a9a9a9">the citizens </font>and
advised by a Senate of <font color="#dcdcdc">appointed judges</font>.
As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the
development of Roman government was greatly influenced by the
struggle between the patricians, the aristocracy who owned Roman land
and whose lineage goes back to the founding of Rome, and the
plebeians, the much more numerous citizens. Over time, the laws that
gave the patricians exclusive access to the highest offices in Rome
were repealed or weakened, and the <font color="#2f4f4f">leading
families of plebeians </font>became full members of the aristocracy.
Republican leaders developed a strong tradition and morality that
required public service and patronage in both peace and war, making
military and <font color="#556b2f">political success </font>inextricably
linked. Many of the legal and legislative structures of Rome (later
codified <font color="#6b8e23">in the Justinian Code </font>and the
Napoleonic Code) are still evident throughout Europe and much of the
world in modern nation states and international organisations.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><b>Text number 2</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The exact causes and motives of
military conflicts and expansions during the Roman Republic are
widely debated. Although their motives may be seen as outright
aggression and <font color="#a9a9a9">imperialism</font>, historians
tend to take a much more nuanced approach. They argue that Roman
expansion was driven by short-term defensive and <font color="#dcdcdc">transnational
factors </font>(i.e. relations with city-states and empires outside
the Roman hegemony) and the new uncertainties created by these
decisions. In its early history, as Rome successfully defended itself
against foreign threats in central and later northern Italy,
neighbouring city-states sought the protection offered by the Roman
alliance. Thus, early republican Rome was not an 'empire' or 'state'
in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city-states
(similar to the Greek hegemons of the same period), with varying
degrees of genuine independence (which itself changed over time),
committed to <font color="#2f4f4f">a mutual alliance of self-defence,
</font>but under Roman leadership. With a few notable exceptions, the
successful wars of early republican Rome did not usually lead to
annexation or military occupation, but to <font color="#556b2f">a
return to the </font>status quo ante. However, the defeated city had
been weakened (sometimes by outright land cessions) and was less able
to resist Roman influences, such as Roman settlers seeking to acquire
<font color="#6b8e23">land </font>or trade with the growing Roman
alliance. It was also less able to defend itself against its
non-Roman enemies, making attacks by these enemies more likely. It
was therefore more likely to seek a protective alliance with Rome.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">This growing
alliance </font>expanded Rome's potential enemies and brought Rome
closer to confrontation with the great powers. As a result, both the
Roman League and the city-states seeking its <font color="#dcdcdc">membership
(and protection) </font>increasingly sought alliance. Although there
were exceptions to this (such as the military regime in Sicily after
the First Red War), it was only <font color="#2f4f4f">after the
Second Red War </font>that these alliances began to harden into
something like an empire, at least in some places. This change
occurred mainly in the western parts, such as the <font color="#556b2f">southern

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By contrast, Roman expansion into
Spain and Gaul was a combination of alliance-building and military
occupation. Rome's involvement in eastern Greece in the 2nd century
BC was still <font color="#a9a9a9">alliance-seeking, </font>but this
time against major powers that could compete with Rome. According to
<font color="#dcdcdc">Polybius, </font>who sought to trace how Rome
came to dominate the east of Greece in less than a century, it was
mainly because several <font color="#2f4f4f">Greek </font>city-states
sought Roman protection against the Macedonian and Seleucid empires
<font color="#556b2f">because of the instability </font>caused by the
weakening of Ptolemy's Egypt. Unlike in the west, the east of Greece
had been ruled by large empires for centuries, and Rome's influence
and ally-ship led to wars with these empires, further weakening them
and thus creating an unstable power vacuum that only Rome could fill.
This had some important similarities (and important differences) with
events in Italy centuries earlier, but this time on a global scale.</p>

were both expansionist and defensive wars, aimed at protecting Rome
from neighbouring cities and states and consolidating Roman territory
in the region. Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either
Latin towns and villages or the Sabine tribes of the Apennine hills.
One by one, Rome defeated both the stubborn Sabines and the local
towns, both <font color="#a9a9a9">those under Etruscan rule </font>and
those that had escaped from their Etruscan rulers. Rome defeated the
Latin cities <font color="#dcdcdc">at the Battle of Lake Regillus </font>in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During the last century, the Greek
world had been ruled by the three primary successor empires to
Alexander the Great's: Ptolemy's Egypt, Macedonia and the Seleucid
Empire. In 202 BC, internal problems led to a decline in Egypt's
position, upsetting the balance of power between the successor
states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to form an alliance
to conquer and divide Egypt. Fearing this increasingly unstable
situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to
seek an alliance. The mission was successful, although earlier
attempts by the Greeks to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met
with Roman indifference. Our primary source for these events, the
surviving works of Polybius, do not tell us the reason for Rome's
involvement. Rome issued <font color="#a9a9a9">an ultimatum to </font>Philip
to <font color="#a9a9a9">stop Rome's military campaigns against its
new Greek allies.</font> Doubting Rome's strength (which was
justified, given Rome's performance in the First Macedonian War),
Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Roman and Greek
allies, starting the Second Macedonian War. Despite Philip's recent
successes against the Greeks and his earlier successes against Rome,
his army buckled under the pressure of the Roman-Greek army. In <font color="#dcdcdc">197
BC, </font>Philip was decisively defeated by the Romans at the Battle
of Cynoscephala, and Philip was forced to abandon <font color="#2f4f4f">his
recent Greek conquests. </font>The Romans declared <font color="#556b2f">a
'Greeks' peace'</font>, believing that Philip's defeat now meant
Greek stability. They withdrew from <font color="#6b8e23">Greece

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Fearing the worst, the Romans
launched a major mobilisation and withdrew from newly pacified Spain
and Gaul. They even established a large garrison in <font color="#a9a9a9">Sicily
in </font><font color="#dcdcdc">case the Seleucids entered Italy</font>.
This fear was also shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely
ignored Rome in the years following the Second Macedonian War, but
now followed Rome for the first time since that war. A large
Roman-Greek force was mobilised under the command of the great hero
of the Second Red War, Scipio Africanus, and set off towards Greece,
where the Roman-Syrian War began. After the initial battles, which
exposed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn
Roman power against them in the battle of Thermopylae (as they
believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the
Spartans, <font color="#2f4f4f">the Seleucids </font>lost the battle
and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids
by crossing the Hellespont, the first time a Roman army had ever
entered Asia. The decisive battle was fought <font color="#556b2f">at
the Battle of Magnesia</font>, which the Romans won completely. The
Seleucids demanded peace, and Rome forced them to abandon their
recent conquests of Greece. Although they still ruled a large area,
this defeat marked the decline of their empire as they faced
increasingly aggressive subjects to the east (Parthians) and west
(Greeks). Their empire fell into ruin over the next century,
overshadowed by Pontus. After Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from
Greece<font color="#6b8e23">, assuming (or hoping) that the absence
of a Greek superpower would guarantee a stable peace</font>. In fact,
it did the opposite.</p>

towards Caesar and was perhaps now secretly allied with Caesar's

should not stand for consulship unless he surrendered <font color="#6b8e23">control
of his army to the state</font>, which would have left Caesar
defenceless against his enemies. Caesar chose civil war rather than
surrender his command and face trial.</p>

the plebeians, the plebeians were able to maintain both dictatorship
and censorship. The plebeians of <font color="#a9a9a9">342 BC </font>imposed
restrictions on political office; a person could hold only one office
at a time, and there had to be ten years between the end of his term
of office and his re-election. Other laws sought to ease the debt
burden of plebeians by prohibiting <font color="#dcdcdc">interest on
</font>loans. In <font color="#2f4f4f">337 BC, </font>the first
plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, tribunes and
senators became increasingly close. The Senate realised that it was
necessary to use plebeian officials to achieve the desired goals. In
order to win over the tribunes, the senators <font color="#556b2f">gave
the tribunes a great deal of power, and the </font>tribunes began to
feel beholden to the Senate. As the tribunes and senators grew closer
together, the plebeian senators were often able to secure the

stage, <font color="#556b2f">plebeians </font>already held a
significant number of judgeships. Thus, the number of plebeian
senators was likely to grow rapidly. However, it was still difficult
for a plebeian to enter the Senate if he or she did not come from a
well-known political family, as a new patrician plebeian aristocracy
was born. The old aristocracy existed by force of law, as <font color="#6b8e23">only

existed because of the organisation of society. As such, only a

Hill. A dictator was appointed to end the secession. The dictator
passed a law (<font color="#556b2f">Lex Hortensia) </font>ending the
requirement that patrician senators had to agree before the Council
of Plebeians could consider any bill. This was not the first law to
require that an act of the Council of Plebeians had the full force of
law. The Council of Plebeians gained this power in the original
Valerian law amendment of 449 BC. The significance of this law was
that it deprived the patricians of the ultimate weapon against the
plebeians. The result was that the control of the state fell not on
the shoulders of the electorate but on the shoulders of the new

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 118 BC, King Micipsa of Numidia
(present-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was succeeded by two
legitimate sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son,
<font color="#a9a9a9">Jugurtha.</font> Micaiah divided his kingdom
between the three sons. However, Jugurtha turned against his
brothers, killed Hiempsal and drove Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal
fled to Rome for help, and Rome first settled the division of the
land between the brothers. Eventually Jugurtha renewed his attack,
leading to a long and fruitless war with Rome. He also bribed several
Roman commanders and at least two tribunes before and during the war.
His enemy, Gaius<font color="#dcdcdc"> Marius</font>, a legate from
an almost unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia
and was elected consul in <font color="#2f4f4f">107 BC </font>despite

Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a swift end, capturing

The </font>centre of the movement was the town of Faesulae, a natural

aided by an uprising within the city. Having murdered the consuls and
most of the senators, Catiline would be free to implement his
reforms. The conspiracy was launched in 63 BC. Marcus Tullius Cicero,
consul of the year, intercepted messages sent by Catiline in an
attempt to recruit more members. As a result, Rome's leading
conspirators (including at least <font color="#556b2f">one former

depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their most stubborn

Roman army had a </font>triple role: to secure its borders, to
exploit remote areas by, among other things, levying taxes on
conquered peoples, and to maintain internal order. From the outset,
Roman soldiers were typical of this model, and most Roman wars were
characterised by one or other of the two types. The first is foreign
warfare, usually launched as a counter-attack or <font color="#dcdcdc">in

war, </font>which plagued the Roman Republic in its last century. The
Roman armies were not invincible, despite their immense reputation
and the numerous victories they had won. Over the centuries, the
Romans 'produced their share of incompetents' who led the Roman
armies to catastrophic defeats. However, the fate of Rome's greatest
enemies, such as Pyrrhus and Hannibal, was usually to win the initial

War revealed not only the shortage of men but also the tactical

217 BC, near the start of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to
effectively abandon its long-standing principle that its soldiers had
to be both citizens and <font color="#a9a9a9">property </font>owners.
The <font color="#dcdcdc">2nd century BC </font>saw a general decline
in the Roman population, partly due <font color="#2f4f4f">to the huge
losses suffered in the various wars</font>. This was accompanied by
severe social pressures and <font color="#556b2f">a wider collapse of

arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, something it had not

assemblies diminished and the Senate took on a greater role in
ordinary lawmaking. Its members were usually appointed by Roman
censors, who usually elected newly elected judges as members of the
Senate, making the Senate a partially elected body. In times of
military emergency, such as during the civil wars of the 1st century

Japanese suffered an unprecedented defeat at the Battle of
Suixian-Zaoyang and the First Battle of Changsha. Following these
victories, Chinese Nationalist forces launched a large-scale
counter-offensive in early 1940, but the Japanese army repulsed it in

much of northern, central and coastal China, the Nationalist
government had retreated inland and established a temporary capital

Communists continued to control the Shaanxi base areas. In addition,
Japanese control of North and Central China was somewhat tenuous,
with Japan generally able to control the railways and major cities
(&quot;points and lines&quot;), but without a significant military or
administrative presence in China's vast rural areas. The Japanese
found that their offensive against China's retreating and regrouping
army had stalled in <font color="#a0522d">the mountainous terrain of

occupied most of the Nationalist territories. On the other hand, some
Nationalist units were used to blockade the Communists rather than
the Japanese. In addition, many of the Chinese Nationalist forces
were allied warlords of Chiang Kai-Shek, but not directly under his
command. &quot;Of the 1 200 000 soldiers under Chiang's control, only

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By mid-1942, the Japanese held a
vast area from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific, although they
had no resources to defend or maintain it. Moreover, the doctrine of
the Combined Fleet was inadequate to implement the proposed
&quot;obstacle&quot; defense. Instead, Japan decided to launch
further attacks in both the South and Central Pacific. Although Japan
had the element of surprise at Pearl Harbor, the Allied codebreakers
had now turned the tide. They learned that an attack was planned on
Port Moresby; if it fell, Japan would control the sea areas north and
west of Australia and could isolate the country. The aircraft carrier
<font color="#a9a9a9">USS Lexington</font>, under <font color="#dcdcdc">Admiral
Fletcher, </font>joined the USS Yorktown and an American-Australian
task force to halt the Japanese advance. The Battle of the Coral Sea

to the Zuikaku air wing, both of which were dropped from the
operation against Midway the following month. Although the Allied
losses were greater than the Japanese, the attack on Port Moresby was
thwarted and the Japanese invasion force was turned back, a strategic
victory for the Allies. The Japanese were forced to abandon their
attempts to isolate Australia. In addition, the Japanese had no
capacity to replace the ships, aircraft and trained pilots lost.</p>

Japanese were waiting for him. The planned surveillance of the US
fleet by long-range seaplanes was not carried out (following an

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As Nimitz expected, the Japanese
fleet arrived off Midway on <font color="#a9a9a9">4 June and was
</font>spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo made the first strike
on Midway, and Fletcher launched his aircraft towards Nagumo's
aircraft carriers. At 0920 hours, the first US aircraft from the
carriers arrived, the TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from the Hornet,
but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffective; thanks in
part to faulty air-to-air torpedoes, they did not get a single hit,
and the defensive Zero fighters destroyed all <font color="#dcdcdc">15
aircraft.</font> At 09.35, Enterprise was attacked by 15 more TBDs,
14 of which were destroyed, again without a hit. By this time the
Fletcher attacks had been disorganised and seemingly ineffective, but
they managed to draw the Nagumo defensive fighters to sea level,
where they used much of their fuel and ammunition to repel two waves
of torpedo bombers. By the time the American dive bombers arrived at
high altitude, the Zeros were ill-positioned to defend themselves. To
make matters worse, Nagumo's <font color="#2f4f4f">four </font>aircraft
carriers had drifted away from the formation in an attempt to avoid
the torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft
fire. Nagumo's indecision had also caused confusion on board its
aircraft carriers. Alert to the need for a second strike on Midway,
but also wary of having to face the American carriers he now knew
were nearby, Nagumo <font color="#556b2f">twice </font>changed the
arming orders of his aircraft. As a result, American dive-bombers
struck the Japanese carriers, their decks full of <font color="#6b8e23">ammunition,

However, a second attack by US aircraft carriers a few hours later

With his carriers lost and the Americans retreating beyond the reach
of his powerful battleships, Yamamoto was forced to abort the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Japanese and Allied forces occupied
different parts of the island, and over the next six months both
sides expended their resources in an escalating battle of attrition
on land, sea and sky. Most of the Japanese aircraft deployed in the
South Pacific were transferred to the <font color="#a9a9a9">Guadalcanal

forces and aircraft stationed on aircraft carriers at Henderson
Field. Meanwhile, Japanese ground forces repeatedly attacked heavily

reinforcements were supplied by Japanese convoys, which the Allies
called the <font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;Tokyo Express&quot;.</font>
The convoys were often engaged in night battles with enemy naval
forces, using destroyers that the IJN could not afford to lose.
Subsequent naval battles involving heavier ships, and even daytime

known as 'Ironbottom Sound' <font color="#556b2f">because of the

Following Doolittle's lightning raid, the Japanese army carried
out a massive sweep through China's Zhejiang and Jiangxi regions, now
known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the aim of searching for
surviving American airmen, retaliating against the Chinese who helped
them and destroying air bases. The operation began on 15 May 1942
with 40 infantry battalions and 15-16 artillery battalions, but was
repulsed by Chinese forces in September. During this campaign, the
Imperial Japanese Army left behind devastation and also spread the
pathogens of cholera, typhoid, plague and dysentery. Chinese
estimates put the death toll at 250<font color="#556b2f">000

November 1943, Samu<font color="#6b8e23">Yokoyama</font>, commander
of the Imperial Japanese 11th Army, sent the 39th, 58th, 13th, 3rd,
116th and 68th Divisions, totalling some 100,000 troops, to attack
Changdee, China. During the seven-week battle of Changde, the Chinese
forced Japan to wage an expensive war of attrition. Although the
Japanese army initially managed to take the city, the Chinese 57th
Division was able to hold them off long enough for reinforcements to
arrive and surround the Japanese. The Chinese army then cut off the
Japanese supply lines and forced them to retreat, after which the
Chinese drove the enemy back. During the battle, Japan used chemical
weapons in a desperate act. <br/>
After the Japanese invasion of
Burma, there was widespread unrest in eastern India and a
catastrophic famine in Bengal, which eventually killed up to 3
million people. Despite these and inadequate communications, British
and Indian forces attempted limited counter-attacks in Burma in early
1943. The attack on Arakan failed, and a long-range assault by the
Chindits led by Brigadier-General Orde Wingate suffered heavy
casualties, but was touted as a morale-booster for the Allies. It
also provoked the Japanese to launch major offensives of their own
the following year.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">So it was only in <font color="#a9a9a9">1944
that the US </font>Navy began to use its 150 submarines to maximum
effect: it installed efficient ship radars, replaced commanders
deemed lacking in aggressiveness and repaired the faults in the
torpedoes. Japanese trade protection was &quot;unspeakably lax&quot;[nb
14] and the convoys were poorly organised and defended compared with
Allied convoys, the result of faulty IJN doctrine and training -
errors that were masked by American mistakes as much as by Japanese
overconfidence. The number of US submarine patrols (and sinkings)
rose sharply: 350 patrols (<font color="#dcdcdc">180 </font>ships

because so few targets ventured into the open sea. In all, Allied
submarines destroyed <font color="#556b2f">1,200 </font>merchant
ships - about five million tons of shipping. Most were small cargo
ships, but 124 were tankers bringing much-needed oil from the East
Indies. A further 320 were passenger ships and troopships. During the
critical stages of the Guadalcanal, Saipan and Leyte campaigns,
thousands of Japanese troops were killed or diverted from where they
were needed. More than 200 warships were sunk, ranging from several
auxiliary ships and destroyers to one battleship and as many as <font color="#6b8e23">eight

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In mid-1944, Japan mobilised more
than 500,000 men and launched a massive operation across China,
code-named <font color="#a9a9a9">Operation Ichi-Go</font>, its
largest offensive of World War II, aimed at consolidating
Japanese-controlled areas in China and French Indochina, and seizing
air bases in south-east China where American bombers were based.
During this period, many of the latest American-trained Chinese units
and supplies had been forcibly confined to the Burma theater under
Joseph Stilwell, who had been put on loan. Although Japan suffered
<font color="#dcdcdc">some 100,000 </font>casualties, these attacks,
the largest for several years, gave the Japanese a large head start
before Chinese forces halted the attacks on <font color="#2f4f4f">Guangxi.</font>
Despite significant tactical gains, the operation did not, on
balance, bring significant strategic gains for Japan. The vast
majority of Chinese troops were able to withdraw from the area and
later return to attack Japanese positions, such as the Battle of West
Hunan. Japan was no closer to defeating China after this operation,
and Japan's continued losses in the Pacific meant that Japan never
had the time and resources it needed to achieve a final victory over
China. Operation Ichi-go caused great social upheaval in the areas of
China affected by it. The <font color="#556b2f">Chinese Communist
guerrillas </font>were able to exploit this confusion to gain
influence and power in large rural areas after Ichi-go.</p>

on a mountainous and densely forested border. The attack, code-named
Operation U-Go, was supported by <font color="#dcdcdc">Lieutenant
General Renya Mutaguchi</font>, the newly promoted commander of
Japan's Fifteenth Army; the imperial headquarters authorised the
attack despite the misgivings of several intervening headquarters.
Although several units of the British Fourteenth Army had to fight
their way out of the blockade, by early April they were concentrated
around Imphal in Manipur state. A Japanese division that had advanced
to <font color="#2f4f4f">the town of Kohima in Nagaland </font>cut

</font>aircraft carriers and <font color="#2f4f4f">956 </font>aircraft,
7 battleships, 28 submarines and 69 destroyers, as well as several

nine-tenths of the Japanese battle fleet, which included <font color="#556b2f">nine
</font>aircraft carriers with 473 aircraft, five battleships, several
cruisers and 28 destroyers. Ozawa's pilots were outnumbered 2:1, and
their aircraft were incoming or already obsolete. The Japanese had
considerable anti-aircraft defences, but lacked close-in fuzes or
good radar. Ozawa devised a suitable strategy. His planes had greater
range because they were not weighed down by armour; they could attack
at a range of about 480 kilometres and search at a radius of 900
kilometres. The US Navy's Hellcat fighters could only attack at a
range of 320 kilometres (200 miles) and search at a range of 523
kilometres (<font color="#6b8e23">325 miles)</font>[citation needed].
Ozawa planned to exploit this advantage by positioning his fleet at a
range of 300 miles (480 km)[citation needed]. Japanese aircraft would
strike US aircraft carriers, land on Guam to refuel, and then strike
the enemy again when they returned to their carriers. Ozawa also
landed about 500 land-based aircraft on Guam and other islands.</p>

South Asia to Japan and cut off important Japanese garrisons.
MacArthur advocated an invasion of the Philippines, which also
crossed Japanese supply lines. Roosevelt favoured the Philippines.
Meanwhile, Toyoda Soemu, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet,
drew up four plans covering all the Allied attack options. <font color="#556b2f">On

had <font color="#a9a9a9">four </font>aircraft carriers, two obsolete

Halsey's ships set off in pursuit of Ozawa shortly after midnight. US
commanders ignored reports that Kurita had turned back towards the
San Bernardino Strait. They had taken the bait set by Ozawa. On the
morning of October 25, Ozawa launched 75 planes. US fighter patrols
shot down most of them. By 08:00, the American fighters had destroyed
a grid of Japanese fighters and struck the ships. By nightfall they
had sunk the carriers Zuikaku, Zuihō and Chiyoda and one destroyer.
A fourth aircraft carrier, Chitose, and a cruiser were disabled and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Kurita passed through the San
Bernardino Strait on <font color="#a9a9a9">25 October at 03.00 </font>and
headed <font color="#dcdcdc">along the coast of Samar. </font>In his
path were only three groups (<font color="#2f4f4f">Taffy 1, 2 and 3)
</font>of the Seventh Fleet, commanded by Admiral Thomas Kinkaid.
Each group had six escort carriers with a total of over 500 aircraft
and seven or eight destroyers or destroyer escorts (DE). Kinkaid
still believed that Lee's forces were guarding the north, so the
Japanese had the element of surprise when they attacked Taffy 3 at
0645 hours. Kurita mistook Taffy's carriers for large fleet carriers
and thought he had the entire Third Fleet in his sights. Since the
escort carriers had little chance against the battleships, Admiral
Clifton Sprague directed Taffy 3's carriers to turn and flee to the
east, hoping that poor visibility would reduce the accuracy of
Japanese gunfire, and used his destroyers to distract the Japanese
battleships. The destroyers carried out disruptive torpedo attacks
against the Japanese. Yamato remained in evasive action for ten
minutes. Two US destroyers and one DE were sunk, but had bought
enough time for the Taffy groups to launch their aircraft. Taffy 3
turned and fled south, and the shells hit some of its carriers,
sinking one of them. The superior speed of the Japanese allowed it to
approach and fire on the other two Taffy groups. At 0920 hours,
however, Kurita suddenly turned and retreated to the north. Signals
had disabused him of the notion that he was attacking the Third
Fleet, and the longer Kurita continued to fight, the greater the risk
of a major air strike. <font color="#556b2f">Fighter attacks </font>had
broken up Japanese formations and shattered tactical control. <font color="#6b8e23">Three

dropped <font color="#a9a9a9">an atomic bomb on </font>the Japanese
city of <font color="#dcdcdc">Hiroshima in the </font>first nuclear
bomb attack in history. In a press release after the atomic bombing
of Hiroshima, Truman warned Japan to surrender or &quot;...expect a

last nuclear bomb attack in history. More than 140 000 to 240 000
people died as a direct result of the two bombings. The need for
nuclear bombing has long been debated, with opponents arguing that
the naval blockade and the aerial bombing campaign made the invasion,
and therefore the atomic bomb, unnecessary. However, other scholars
have argued that the bombing shocked the Japanese government into
surrender, and the Emperor eventually expressed his desire to end the
war. Another argument in favour of the atomic bombs is that they
avoided <font color="#556b2f">Operation Downfall </font>or a
prolonged blockade and bombing campaign, which would have caused much
greater casualties among Japanese civilians. Historian <font color="#6b8e23">Richard

from Spain, and San Diego became part of the Mexican territory of
<font color="#a9a9a9">Alta California</font>. In 1822, Mexico began
trying to extend its power to the coastal region of Alta California.
<font color="#dcdcdc">The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually
abandoned</font>, and the city of San Diego grew on the flat land
below Presidio Hill. The Mexican government landed the mission in
1833, and most of the mission lands were sold to wealthy Californian
settlers. The town's 432 residents petitioned the governor to form a
pueblo, and <font color="#2f4f4f">Juan María Osuna </font>was
elected the first alcalde ('municipal judge'), defeating <font color="#556b2f">Pío
Pico in </font>a vote. (See List of San Diego mayors before
statehood.) However, San Diego had been losing population throughout
the 1830s, and in 1838 the city lost its status as a pueblo because
<font color="#6b8e23">its size had dropped to an estimated 100-150
inhabitants.</font> Outside the city, Mexican land grants increased
the number of California ranchos, adding modestly to the local

war with Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta
California. At first they had an easy job capturing the main ports,
such as San Diego, but the Californians living in the southern part
of Alta California struck back. After a successful rebellion in Los
Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven off without
firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego
for <font color="#a9a9a9">three weeks </font>until the Americans
retook it on 24 October 1846. For the next few months, the Americans
were surrounded inside the pueblo. Battles were fought daily, and

located at the foot of Presidio Hill, in what is now Old Town San
Diego State Historic Park. The location was not ideal, as it was
<font color="#a9a9a9">several miles from the waterfront. </font>In
1850, <font color="#dcdcdc">William Heath Davis </font>promoted a new
development on the bayfront called &quot;New San Diego,&quot; located
several miles south of the original settlement; for several decades,
however, the new development included only a few houses, a pier and

</font>promoted migration to the area across the bay, which he called
&quot;<font color="#556b2f">New Town&quot; </font>and which became
downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and
businesses began moving to New Town because of its convenient
location on San Diego Bay for shipping. New Town soon eclipsed the
original settlement, still known as Old Town, and became the economic
and administrative center of the city. Even so, San Diego remained a
relatively backward city until <font color="#6b8e23">the railroad was

fishermen from the <font color="#6b8e23">Azores </font>and Italy,
whose influence is still felt in neighbourhoods like Little Italy and
Point Loma. Due to <font color="#a0522d">rising costs and foreign

canyons and hills that separate its mesas, creating <font color="#a9a9a9">small
pockets of natural open space </font>scattered around the city and
giving it a hilly geography. Traditionally, San Diego residents have
built their homes and businesses on the mesas hills, leaving the
urban canyons relatively unspoiled. As a result, the canyons give
parts of the city a fragmented feel, creating gaps between otherwise
close-knit neighborhoods and contributing to a car-centric and
sparsely populated environment. <font color="#2f4f4f">The San Diego
River </font>runs through the centre of San Diego <font color="#556b2f">from

91 metres (300 feet) in San Diego can be traced back to the
construction of <font color="#a9a9a9">the El Cortez Hotel in </font>1927,
the tallest building in the city between 1927 and 1963. Over time,
several buildings, including the <font color="#dcdcdc">Union Bank of

San Diego's tallest skyscraper. Currently, San Diego's tallest
building is the 150-metre-high One America Plaza, completed in 1991.
There are no super skyscrapers in the downtown skyline because a
<font color="#556b2f">Federal Aviation Administration </font>regulation
introduced in the 1970s limited the height of buildings to 500 feet

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">San Diego, like most of Southern
California, often experiences significant climate variation over
short geographical distances, resulting in microclimates. In San
Diego, this is mainly due to the city's topography (bay and numerous
hills, mountains and canyons). Often, especially during the grayness
of May and the gloom of June, <font color="#a9a9a9">a thick &quot;marine
layer&quot; of cloud cover </font><font color="#dcdcdc">keeps the air
cool and humid a </font>few miles from the coast, but gives way to
bright, cloudless sunshine about 5-10 miles (8.0-16.1 km) inland.
Sometimes the June gloom can continue into July, when cloudy skies
cover most of San Diego all day. Even in the absence of June
darkness, <font color="#2f4f4f">inland </font>temperature variations
tend to be much greater than in coastal areas, where the sea has a
regulating influence. For example, in downtown San Diego, average
January temperatures average <font color="#556b2f">10°C (50°F) </font>and
August highs average 26°C (78°F). In the city of El Cajon, located
just 10 miles inland from downtown San Diego, average January
temperatures average 6°C (42°F) and August highs average 31°C

was <font color="#a9a9a9">KFMB, which </font>began broadcasting on
May 16, 1949. Because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
granted seven television stations to Los Angeles, two VHF channels
were available to San Diego because of its <font color="#dcdcdc">relative
proximity to a larger city</font>. In 1952, however, the FCC began to
allocate UHF channels, allowing cities like San Diego to acquire more
stations<font color="#2f4f4f">.</font> The San Diego market also
includes stations in Mexico (with ITU prefixes XE and XH). The
television stations are currently XHTJB 3 (Once TV), XETV 6 (CW),

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Due to the ratio of licensed
stations in the United States and Mexico, San Diego is the largest
media market in the United States where a duopoly of two full-power
television stations cannot legally be maintained under FCC
regulations. The FCC's rules prohibit duopolies in metropolitan areas
with fewer than nine full-power television stations, and require that
after the duopoly is formed, there remain eight station owners (there
are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San
Diego-Tijuana market).[Although KGTV and KZSD-LP are owned by the
E.W. Scripps Company, they are not considered a duopoly under the
FCC's legal definition, since joint ownership of full-power and
low-power television stations in the same market is permitted
regardless of the number of stations licensed in the area. Overall,
there are <font color="#a9a9a9">two </font>duopolies and one triopoly

wide network of routes suitable for cycling. San Diego's <font color="#a9a9a9">dry
and mild climate </font>makes cycling a convenient and pleasant
option year-round. At the same time, the <font color="#dcdcdc">city's
hilly, canyon-like terrain </font>and significantly long average
travel distances due to strict and sparsely populated zoning laws
limit cycling for commercial purposes to some extent. Older and
denser residential areas around the city centre are generally
oriented towards utility cycling. This is partly because newer
developments further away from the core of the city, where
suburban-style highways are much more common, do not currently have a
<font color="#2f4f4f">grid street pattern.</font> As a result, the
majority of cycling-related activities are recreational. Thanks to
San Diego's cycling activities, in 2006 San Diego was rated the best
city for cycling among US cities of over one million people.</p>

regional transport projects have been implemented to reduce
congestion in San Diego. Notable projects include improvements to San

included the widening of the 5 and 805 freeways around &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">The

scholars from all over the world sought to translate and compile all
known knowledge of the world into Arabic. The Abbasids were
influenced by Qur'anic injunctions and hadiths such as &quot;the ink
of a scholar is holier than the blood of a martyr&quot;, which
emphasised the value of knowledge. The great Islamic capitals of
Baghdad, Cairo and Córdoba became the main intellectual centres of
science, philosophy, medicine and education. During this period, the
Muslim world was a collection of cultures, bringing together and
developing the knowledge of ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese,
Indian, Egyptian and Phoenician civilisations.</p>

Nights </font>(Persian: hezār-o-yek šab &gt; Arabic:
ʔalf-layl-at-wa-l'-layla= Thousand Nights and (One) Night) or *The
Arabian Nights, a name coined by early Western translators, is a
collection of folk tales from Sanskrit, Persian and later Arabic
fables. The original concept derives from the pre-Islamic Persian
prototype <font color="#dcdcdc">Hezār Afsān </font><font color="#2f4f4f">(A
Thousand Tales)</font>, which was based on certain Indian elements.
It reached its final form <font color="#556b2f">in the 13th century</font>;
the number and type of tales have varied from manuscript to
manuscript. All Arabic fantasy tales are usually called Arabian
Nights tales when translated into <font color="#6b8e23">English,
whether </font>or not they appear in the Arabian Nights. This work
has been very influential in the West since its translation by
Antoine<font color="#228b22"> Galland </font><font color="#a0522d">in
the 1700s.</font> Imitations were written, especially in France.
Various characters from the epic have become icons of Western

scholars </font>contributed to the development of science. They put
much more emphasis on experimentation than the Greeks. This led to
the development of the <font color="#dcdcdc">early scientific method

with the experiments on <font color="#556b2f">optics </font>carried
out by <font color="#2f4f4f">Ibn al-Haytham </font>(Alhazen) around
the year 1000, which he presented in <font color="#6b8e23">his Book
of Optics</font>. The most important development in scientific
methodology was the use of experiments to distinguish between
competing scientific theories within a generally empirical
orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. <font color="#a0522d">Ibn
al-Haytham </font>is also considered the father of optics, especially
his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Some have
also described Ibn al-Haytham as the &quot;first scientist&quot;.
<font color="#228b22">al-Khwarzimi </font>invented the logarithmic
base systems we use today, and he also proposed the theorems of
trigonometry and limit theorems. Recent research shows that it is
very likely that <font color="#191970">Muslim artists of the Middle
