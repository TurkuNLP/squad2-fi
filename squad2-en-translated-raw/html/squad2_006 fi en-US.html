<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the Roman period, copper was
mined mainly <font color="#a9a9a9">in Cyprus</font>, hence the name
of the metal aes сyprium (Cypriot metal), which was later changed to
<font color="#dcdcdc">сuprum</font>, from which the words copper
(English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) all
derive. Its compounds are commonly found <font color="#2f4f4f">as
copper (II) salts</font>, which often impart a <font color="#556b2f">blue
</font><font color="#6b8e23">or green </font>colour to minerals such
as azurite, malachite and turquoise, and have historically been
widely used as pigments. Architectural structures built with copper
rust and form a <font color="#a0522d">greenish green verdigris </font>(or
patina). In decorative art, copper is prominent both as such and in
the form of pigments.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Copper occurs naturally as native
copper and was known in some of the oldest civilisations. Copper has
a history of use dating back at least 10 000 years, and it is
estimated that it was discovered <font color="#dcdcdc">in the Middle
East in </font><font color="#a9a9a9">9000 BC</font>; a copper pendant
dating back to 8700 BC was found in northern Iraq. There is evidence
that gold and meteorite iron (but not iron smelting) were the only
metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy
is believed to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working
of copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting and 4) the lost wax method. In
south-eastern Anatolia, all four metallurgical techniques appear more
or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic period,
around 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was invented
independently in different parts of the world, copper smelting was
also invented locally in several different places. It was probably
discovered independently in China before <font color="#2f4f4f">2800
BC. </font>, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD and in West
Africa around the 9th or 10th century AD. The investment casting was
invented between 4500 and 4000 BC. Coal mining dates back to
2280-1890 BC at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK. Ötzi the Iceman, a
male personage dating from 3300-3200 BC, found an axe with 99.7% pure
copper in its head; the high arsenic content of his hair suggests
that he was involved in copper smelting. The experience gained with
copper has helped the development of other metals; in particular, the
smelting of copper led to the invention of<font color="#556b2f"> iron
smelting.</font> The production of the old copper complex in Michigan
and Wisconsin dates back to 6000-3000 BC. Natural bronze, a <font color="#6b8e23">type
of copper </font>made from copper ores containing silicon, arsenic
and (rarely) tin, came into common use in the Balkans around <font color="#a0522d">5500
BC. </font>[referred ].</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Copper, silver and gold belong to
<font color="#a9a9a9">group 11 of the </font>periodic table and share
certain common properties: they have a <font color="#dcdcdc">single
s-orbital electron </font>on a <font color="#2f4f4f">full d-electron
shell and are </font>characterised by high toughness and electrical
conductivity. The filled d-shells of these elements have little
effect on the interatomic interactions, which are dominated by
s-electrons through metal bonds. In contrast to metals with imperfect
d-shells, copper's metallic bonds lack covalent character and are
relatively weak. This explains the low hardness and high toughness of
copper single-crystal crystals. At the macroscopic scale, the
introduction of extended defects, such as grain boundaries, into the
crystal lattice prevents the material from flowing under stress and
thus increases its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually
supplied in <font color="#556b2f">fine-grained </font>polycrystalline<font color="#556b2f">

of a metal; around the same time it was discovered that the amount

timbre of a watch. Jet smelting was developed by the Finnish company
Outokumpu and first applied in Harjavalta in 1949; the

transports copper excreted in milk and is particularly well absorbed
as a source of copper. Copper in the body is normally transported in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Anthropologists have most often used
the term &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">identity&quot; to refer to </font>this
idea of self in a loosely Eriksonian way (Erikson 1972), based on the
uniqueness and individuality that distinguishes one from others.
Identity became of increasing interest to <font color="#dcdcdc">anthropologists
with the </font>emergence of contemporary concerns about ethnicity
and social movements in the 1970s. This was reinforced by a trend in
sociological thinking to appreciate how the overall social context
affects and is affected by the individual. At the same time, <font color="#2f4f4f">an
Eriksonian approach </font>to identity persisted, with the result
that until recently identity has been used in a largely
socio-historical way to refer to the characteristics of sameness
associated with a person's connection to others and to a particular
group of people.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Boundaries can be <font color="#a9a9a9">inclusive
or exclusive, depending on how </font>other people see them. An
<font color="#dcdcdc">exclusionary </font>boundary occurs, for
example, when a person adopts a sign that places restrictions on <font color="#2f4f4f">the
behaviour of others. An </font><font color="#556b2f">inclusive
</font>boundary, on the other hand, is created by using a sign that
other people are willing and able to <font color="#6b8e23">join</font>.
At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary also imposes
restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their
participation in other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a
particular language by an entrant in a room full of people speaking
different languages. Some people may understand the language used by
this person, while others may not. Those who do not understand the
language may see the <font color="#a0522d">language </font>used by
the newcomer as merely a neutral expression of identity. But they may
also perceive it as an exclusive boundary designed to separate them
from him or her. On the other hand, those who do understand the
language of the newcomer may see it as an inclusive boundary that
allows the newcomer to relate to them outside of the other people
present. Equally, however, it is possible that people who understand
the newcomer but also speak another language may not want to speak
the newcomer's language and thus see his or her labelling as coercive
and a negative boundary. It is possible that the newcomer is either
aware or unaware of this, depending on whether or not he or she
speaks other languages or whether or not he or she is aware of and
respects the multilingualism of the people present.</p>

and commitments they make to <font color="#556b2f">certain personal

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The implications are manifold, as
different research traditions nowadays strongly use <font color="#a9a9a9">the
identity lens </font>to study phenomena.[Reference ] One of the
implications of identity and <font color="#dcdcdc">identity
construction </font>can be seen <font color="#2f4f4f">in professional
environments</font>. This becomes increasingly challenging in
stigmatized jobs or &quot;dirty work&quot; (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and
Trethewey (2005) state that &quot;individuals are attracted to and
turn away from particular jobs depending in part on the extent to
which they reinforce a &quot;preferred organizational self&quot;
(Tracy &amp; Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs are associated with
different stigmas or praise. In her analysis, Tracy uses the example
of prison officers trying to shake off the stigma of the '<font color="#556b2f">glorified
domestic servant</font>' (Tracy &amp; Tretheway 2005). &quot;The
process by which people arrive at justifications and values for
different occupational choices.&quot; These include <font color="#6b8e23">job
satisfaction and overall quality of life </font>(Tracy &amp; Scott
2006, p. 33). People working in this type of workplace need to <font color="#a0522d">find
ways to create </font><font color="#228b22">an identity they can live
with.</font> &quot;Creating a positive self-concept at work is more
challenging when one's work is considered 'dirty' by social norms&quot;
(Tracy &amp; Scott 2006, p. 7). &quot;In other words, stain
management is not just about making the employee feel good about the
job in question. &quot;If workers have to navigate discourses that
question the viability of their work and/or experience barriers to
taint management by turning dirty work into a badge of honour, it is
likely that they will perceive <font color="#191970">blaming the
customer as an </font>effective route to affirming their identity&quot;

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">These various studies of &quot;identity&quot;
show how difficult the concept is to define. Since identity is a

<font color="#a9a9a9">define </font>it<font color="#a9a9a9">
empirically. In </font><font color="#dcdcdc">discussions of identity,
the </font>term is used in a variety of senses, ranging from
fundamental and permanent sameness to fluidity, contingency,
negotiability, and so on. Brubaker and Cooper note that many
researchers tend to confuse identity as a category of practice and <font color="#2f4f4f">a
category of analysis </font>(Brubaker &amp; Cooper 2000, p. 5).
Indeed, many researchers tend to follow <font color="#556b2f">their
own preconceptions of identity </font>and adhere more or less to the
frameworks listed above, rather than taking into account the
mechanisms by which the concept crystallises into reality. In this
environment, some analysts, such as Brubaker and Cooper, have
suggested abandoning the concept altogether (Brubaker &amp; Cooper
2000, p. 1). Others have sought to adopt alternative concepts in an
attempt to capture the dynamic and changing nature of <font color="#6b8e23">human
social self-expression</font>. Hall (1992, 1996), for example,
suggests that identity is treated as a process in order to <font color="#a0522d">capture

Some scholars have introduced <font color="#228b22">the idea of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Erik Erikson
</font>(1902-1994) was one of the earliest psychologists to take an
explicit interest in identity. Erikson's framework is based on a
psychological sense of continuity, called <font color="#dcdcdc">self-identity
</font>(sometimes simply called &quot;self&quot;), distinguishing
between the personal characteristics that distinguish one person from
another, called <font color="#2f4f4f">personal identity, </font>and
the set of social roles that a person can play, called either <font color="#556b2f">social
identity or cultural identity. </font>In Erikson's <font color="#6b8e23">psychodynamic
tradition, the </font>work sought to explore the process of identity
formation throughout the life cycle. For example, the gradual
consolidation of self-identity can be mapped through a series of
stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly
sophisticated challenges. The process of forming a culturally viable
identity is conceptualized as the task of adolescence, and those who
fail to resynthesize childhood identifications are considered to be
in a state of &quot;identity diffusion,&quot; while those who retain
their originally assigned identities unchallenged have &quot;closed&quot;
identities (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson 2003 pp. 7-8). According to
some interpretations of Erikson, the development of a strong
self-identity and appropriate integration into a stable society and
culture generally leads to a stronger sense of identity. Conversely,
deficits in either of these factors can increase the possibility of
identity crisis or disorientation (Cote &amp; Levine 2002, p. 22).</p>

i.e. the </font>self's perception of another's view of the self,
which has been found to be of great importance in clinical contexts
such as anorexia nervosa (Saunderson and O'Kane, 2005). Harré also
conceptualises the components of <font color="#6b8e23">self/identity

<font color="#556b2f">strategic manipulator </font>is a person who

play roles and thus become one. <font color="#228b22">Relational
selfhood </font>is a perspective in which individuals abandon any
sense of exclusive selfhood and view any sense of identity as a
social engagement with other people. For Gergen, these strategies

Pradesh dates back to the heyday of the Indus Valley civilisation
<font color="#a9a9a9">between 2250 and 1750 BC. </font>Since
prehistoric times, the region was inhabited by tribes such as the
<font color="#2f4f4f">Koilis, Halis, Dadis, Dhaugris, Dasas, Khasi,
Khinaris and Kiratis. </font><font color="#556b2f">In the Vedic
period </font>there were several small republics known as 'Janapada',
which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period
of rule by King Harshavardhana, the region was again divided into
several local kingdoms headed by chiefs, including some Rajput
principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a high degree of independence
and were invaded by the Delhi Sultanate on several occasions. <font color="#6b8e23">Mahmud
Ghaznavi </font>conquered Kangra in the <font color="#a0522d">early
10th century</font>. <font color="#228b22">Timur and Sikander Lodi
</font>also marched on the low hills of the state, capturing several
forts and fighting many battles. Several hill states recognised
Mughal rule and regularly paid tribute to <font color="#191970">the

expand towards the southern part of the state. However, Ram Singh,
who was on the border of the state of Siba, succeeded in capturing
the Siba fort from the remains of Lahore Darbar in Samvat in 1846
during the First Anglo-Sikh War. They came into direct conflict with
the British in the Tarai belt, after which the British expelled them
from the Satluj provinces. The British gradually became a great
power. In India's first war of independence in 1857, which was the
result of many grievances against the British, the people of the hill
states were not as politically active as those in other parts of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Non-verbal communication describes
the process of <font color="#a9a9a9">conveying meaning in the form of
non-verbal messages</font>. Examples of non-verbal communication
include haptic communication, chronological communication, gestures,
<font color="#dcdcdc">body language</font>, facial expression, eye
contact and dress. <font color="#2f4f4f">Nonverbal communication is
</font>also related to the purpose of the message. Examples of intent
are voluntary, intentional movements, such as <font color="#556b2f">shaking
hands </font>or winking, and involuntary, such as <font color="#6b8e23">sweating.</font>
Speech also includes nonverbal elements called paracommunication,
such as rhythm, intonation, tempo and stress. There may even be a
pheromone component in speech. Studies have shown that up to <font color="#a0522d">55%
of </font>human communication can occur through <font color="#228b22">non-verbal
facial expressions </font>and 38% through paralanguage. It is the
subconscious level that most influences communication and builds
<font color="#191970">trust</font>. Similarly, written text contains
non-verbal elements such as handwriting, spatial order of words and
the use of emoticons to convey emotions.</p>

This second view of communication, called the <font color="#2f4f4f">constitutive
model or constructionist view</font>, focuses on how the individual
communicates as a determinant of how the message is interpreted.
Communication is viewed <font color="#556b2f">as a channel</font>; a
medium through which information passes from one individual to
another, and this information becomes separate from the communication
itself. A particular instance of communication is called <font color="#6b8e23">a
speech act. The </font><font color="#a0522d">personal filters of </font>the
sender and the personal filters of the receiver may vary depending on
<font color="#228b22">different regional traditions</font>, cultures
or gender, which may change the intended meaning of the message
content. If there is &quot;<font color="#191970">communication noise&quot;
</font>in the transmission channel (in this case, in the air), the
reception and decoding of the content may be incorrect and the speech
may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this
encode-transmit-receive-encode model is that the encoding and
decoding processes require that the sender and receiver both have
something at their disposal that acts as a codebook, and that the two
codebooks are at least identical, if not identical. Although the
model refers to something like a codebook, it is not represented
anywhere in <font color="#8b0000">the model</font>, which creates
many conceptual difficulties.</p>

Church </font>uses wine in the celebration of the Eucharist because
it is part of a tradition that has been passed down through the ages
since <font color="#dcdcdc">the Last Supper of </font>Jesus Christ,
where Catholics believe that consecrated bread and wine literally
become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, a dogma known as
<font color="#2f4f4f">transubstantiation</font>. Wine is used (not
grape juice) both because of its strong biblical roots and to follow
the tradition of the early Christian church. According to Canon <font color="#556b2f">924
of </font>the Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church (1983), the
wine used must be natural, made from the grapes of the vine, not
adulterated. In some circumstances, a priest may be given special
permission to use <font color="#6b8e23">grape juice </font>for
ordination, but this is extremely rare and usually requires
sufficient reasons, such as the priest's personal health, to justify
such a dispensation.</p>

While Orthodox Jews believe that many elements of current religious
law were enacted or added by <font color="#228b22">the rabbis to
</font>&quot;authenticate&quot; the law, all Orthodox Jews believe
that there is an underlying core of <font color="#191970">Sinai law

therefore directly derived from Sinai and directly reflects the
divine will. Thus, Orthodox Jews believe that extreme caution must be
exercised when interpreting Jewish law. Orthodox Judaism believes
that because of the <font color="#483d8b">divine </font>origin of
<font color="#8b0000">Jewish law</font>, none of its underlying
principles should be compromised to reflect changing political,
social or economic circumstances; in this sense, the 'creativity' and

considerably with <font color="#6b8e23">Haredi Judaism </font>in its
commitment to the secular and commercial world and in social issues.
It precedes the latter, and differs from the former in its
constitution and priorities. The movement originated in Eastern
Europe (present-day Belarus and Ukraine) in the 1700s. It was founded
by <font color="#a0522d">Israel ben Eliezer, </font>known as the Baal
Shem Tov (1698-1760), and emerged during a period of persecution of
Jews, when there was a schism between scholars and ordinary European
Jews. In addition to this narrowing of the class gap, <font color="#228b22">Hasidic
teachings </font>sought to restore the joy of commandment-keeping and
prayer by popularising Jewish mysticism (a joy that had been
suppressed by the Talmud's intense intellectual study). The <font color="#191970">Baal
Shem Tov </font>sought to combine rigorous scholarship with more
sentimental mitzvah observance. In practice, what distinguishes
hasidic Judaism from other forms of hasidic Judaism is that hasidic
communities are tightly organised, with the Rebbe (sometimes
translated as 'Grand Rebbe') at their centre, and that each community
has its own customs and dress codes. In some cases, there are also
religious ideological differences between Hasidic groups. Another
phenomenon that distinguishes Hasidic Judaism from Hasidism in
general is the strong emphasis on speaking <font color="#8b0000">Yiddish</font>;
(many) Hasidic households and communities speak exclusively <font color="#483d8b">Yiddish.</font></p>

<font color="#dcdcdc">ethyl alcohol</font>, which is the same
chemical found in wine and distilled spirits, so drinking beer has
short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user.
Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different
effects on humans. The effects of alcohol depend on factors such as
the amount of alcohol a person has consumed, the percentage of
alcohol in the beer and the time of consumption, the amount of food
consumed and whether the person has taken other prescription or
over-the-counter medicines or street drugs. Adequate drinking at
blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels of 0.03-0.12% typically
causes <font color="#556b2f">an overall improvement in mood and
possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, </font>reduced
anxiety, facial flushing and redness, impaired judgment and fine
muscle coordination. BAC levels of 0.09-0.25% cause <font color="#6b8e23">lethargy,
sedation, balance problems and blurred vision.</font> A BAC of
0,18-0,30 % causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred
speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC of 0,25-0,40 %
causes stunning, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting
(death may result from inhalation of vomit (<font color="#a0522d">pulmonary
aspiration</font>) while unconscious) and respiratory depression
(potentially life-threatening). Alcohol levels of 0.35-0.80% cause
<font color="#228b22">coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening
respiratory depression and possibly </font><font color="#191970">fatal
alcohol poisoning</font>. As with all alcoholic beverages, drinking
while driving, flying or operating heavy machinery increases the risk
of an accident; many countries have criminal penalties for
drink-driving.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The first stage, in which wort is
made by mixing a starch source (usually malting barley) with hot
water, is known as &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">mashing</font>&quot;.
The hot water (called '<font color="#dcdcdc">lye' </font>in brewing
parlance) is mixed with crushed malt or malt flour (called 'meal') in
a mash tun. The <font color="#2f4f4f">mashing process </font>takes
about <font color="#556b2f">1-2 hours, during which time </font>the
starch is converted <font color="#6b8e23">into sugars and the </font>sweet
wort is drained from the grains. The grains are then washed in a
process known as 'sparging'. The washing process allows the brewer to
extract as much fermentable liquid as possible from the grains. The
process of filtering the spent grains <font color="#a0522d">from the
wort and dilution water is </font>called wort separation. The
traditional method of <font color="#228b22">wort separation </font>is
<font color="#191970">dilution</font>, where the <font color="#8b0000">grain

</font>published a Federal Register notice on the revision of federal
standards for classifying data on race and ethnicity. OMB developed
the standards for race and ethnicity to provide &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">consistent

government. The development of the data standards stems in large part
from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws.&quot; Among
the changes, OMB issued a directive to &quot;label <font color="#556b2f">one
or more </font>races&quot; after seeing evidence of an increase in
the number of interracial children and wanting to capture diversity
in a measurable way, and after receiving requests from people who
wanted to be able to recognize their own or their children's entire
ancestry rather than identifying with just one group. Prior to this

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Unlike the Spanish milledollar, the
US dollar is based on <font color="#a9a9a9">the decimal system</font>.
In addition to the dollar, the Coinage Act formally established the
monetary units of the mill, or thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥),
the cent, or hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), the dime, or <font color="#dcdcdc">tenth
of a dollar, </font>and the eagle, or ten dollars, each of which was
assigned a weight and composition of gold, silver or copper. In the
mid-19th century, it was suggested that <font color="#2f4f4f">$100
coins be </font>called a union, but union coins were never minted,
and only $50 half-union designs exist. However, only cents are in
everyday use as a dollar denomination; &quot;dime&quot; is used only
as the name of a 10-cent coin, while &quot;eagle&quot; and &quot;mill&quot;
are largely unknown to the general public, although mills are
sometimes used in tax payments, and the price of gasoline is usually
in the form of X.XX9 dollars per gallon, for example, $3.599,
sometimes spelled $3.599⁄10. When coins are in circulation today,
denominations of a dollar or less are issued in US coins, while
denominations of a dollar or more are issued in Federal Reserve notes
(except for gold, silver and platinum coins, which are worth $100 or
less in legal tender, but are worth much more in bullion). Today,
both one dollar coins and banknotes are produced, but the number of
banknotes produced is considerably higher. In the past, &quot;paper&quot;
money was sometimes issued in denominations of less than a dollar
(fractional currency), and gold coins were issued up to <font color="#556b2f">$20
</font>(the so-called &quot;double eagle&quot;, which was
discontinued in the 1930s). <font color="#6b8e23">The </font>term
eagle was used <font color="#6b8e23">in the 1792 Coinage Act </font>for
the ten dollar denomination, and was later used to designate gold
coins. Paper currency of less than one dollar, known as &quot;fractional
currency&quot;, was also sometimes derogatorily referred to as
&quot;shinplasters&quot;. In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of
the Treasury, proposed the creation of $100, $50 and $25 gold coins,
known as the 'Union', 'Half Union' and 'Quarter Union', which meant
that the denomination of 1 Union = $100.</p>

introduced a new $1 US Presidential Coin under the Presidential $1
Coin Act of 2005. The new coin builds on the success of the 50-state
coin series, and features on the obverse the presidents from George
Washington onwards in the order of their inaugurations. The reverse
features <font color="#dcdcdc">the Statue of Liberty. </font>To allow
for larger and more detailed portraits, the traditional engravings &quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">E
Pluribus Unum</font>&quot;, &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, the year of
minting or issue and the mint mark are inscribed on the edge of the
coin instead of the obverse. This feature, which is similar to the
edge lettering on the British £1 coin, is not usually associated
with the design of US coins. The <font color="#556b2f">'Liberty'
</font>inscription has been removed and replaced by the Statue of
Liberty. Furthermore, due to the nature of US coins, this is the
first time that coins of different denominations have been in
circulation with the same President on the obverse (reverse)
(Lincoln/penny, Jefferson/nickel, Franklin D. Roosevelt/ten,
Washington/quarter, Kennedy/half dollar and Eisenhower/dollar).
Another unusual feature of the new $1 coin is that <font color="#6b8e23">Grover

eighths of a grain or 270 grains (<font color="#2f4f4f">17 </font>g)

to <font color="#556b2f">Alexander </font>Hamilton's decision to base
the new US unit on the average weight of some worn Spanish dollars.
Hamilton asked the Treasury Department to weigh a sample of Spanish
dollars, and the average weight was 371 grains. The weight of the new
Spanish dollar was usually about a grain377 , so the new US dollar
was slightly cheaper than the Spanish dollar.</p>

silver dollars and later Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side
in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso
remained legal tender until the Coinage Act of 1857. Coins from the
various English colonies were also in circulation. The lion dollar
was popular in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (New York), but the
lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies in the
17th century and early 1700s. The pieces that circulated in the
colonies were usually worn so that their pattern was not completely
distinctive, so they were sometimes called 'dog dollars'.</p>

popular in the US. Silver dollars were minted intermittently from
<font color="#a9a9a9">1794 to 1935</font>; copper-nickel dollars of
the same size, bearing the image of <font color="#dcdcdc">President
Dwight D. Eisenhower</font>, were minted from 1971 to 1978. Gold
dollars were also minted in the 19th century. <font color="#556b2f">Susan
B. Anthony </font>dollar coin was introduced in 1979; these coins
proved unpopular because they were often mistaken for coins because
they were almost identical in size, had a milled edge and were
similar in colour. The minting of these dollars was suspended in 1980
(the collector pieces were minted in 1981) but, like all previous US
coins, they are still legal tender. As the amount of Anthony dollars
held by the US Federal Reserve, which were mainly distributed as
change at postal and transit machines, had practically been
exhausted, more Anthony dollars were minted in 1999. In 2000, a new
$1 coin with the <font color="#6b8e23">Sacagawea </font>(Sacagawea
dollar) was introduced, which corrected some of the problems of the
Anthony dollar, with its smooth edge and gold colour, but did not
require any changes to the machines accepting Anthony dollars.
However, this new coin has not matched the popularity of the still
existing $1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. Proponents
of the coin have cited the simultaneous withdrawal of the dollar bill
from the market and poor public relations efforts as the primary
reasons for the lack of support for the dollar coin.</p>

One commentator noted that Imperial's plan reflected 'the state of
democracy in Kent, the transformation of a prestigious science
college into a greedy, highly aggressive neo-corporate institution,
and the defence of the scenic area's position - in England as a
whole, not just in the Wye - against unbridled greed, with the
complicity of two important local authorities. The <font color="#8b0000">Wye

George of Brunswick-Lüneburg</font>, ruler of the Duchy of Calenberg
in Brunswick-Lüneburg, moved his residence <font color="#dcdcdc">to
Hanover</font>. In 1692, the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were
elevated to the rank of electoral prince by a decree of <font color="#556b2f">the
Holy Roman Emperor, and </font>this rank was confirmed by the
<font color="#6b8e23">Imperial Diet in </font>1708. The principality
was thus elevated to the electoral duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg,
colloquially known as the electoral duchy of Hanover after the
capital city of Calenberg (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors
later became monarchs of <font color="#a0522d">Great Britain </font>(and
from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The
first of these was <font color="#228b22">George I Louis</font><font color="#191970">,
who </font>ascended to the British throne in 1714. The last British
monarch to rule in Hanover was William IV. The Polisal law, which
required succession to be through the male line as far as possible,
prohibited Queen Victoria's accession to the throne of Hanover. As a
male descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of
the Hanoverian family. However, her descendants bore her husband's
title of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three of the kings of Great Britain or
the United Kingdom were also simultaneously <font color="#8b0000">electors

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Hannover </font>was
founded in the Middle Ages <font color="#dcdcdc">on the eastern bank
of the river Leine</font>. The original name <font color="#2f4f4f">Honovere
</font>may have meant <font color="#556b2f">&quot;high (river) bank&quot;,
</font>but this has been disputed (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hannover was a
small village of ferrymen and fishermen, which became a relatively
large town <font color="#6b8e23">in the 13th century because of its
</font>location at a natural crossroads. Because of the relative
difficulty of travelling by land, the location upriver helped the
city to grow with the increase in trade. The river Leine connected
the town <font color="#a0522d">to the Hanseatic city of Bremen, </font>and
was located near the southern edge of the vast <font color="#228b22">North
German plain </font>and north-west of <font color="#191970">the Harz
mountains, </font>so that east-west traffic, such as <font color="#8b0000">mule
trains, passed </font>through it. Hanover was thus the gateway to the
Rhine, Ruhr and Saar valleys, to the industrial areas growing to the
south-west of them, and to the lowlands to the east and north, which
ran along the Harz between the lowlands and Saxony or Thuringia.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Emotions are complex. According to
some theories, they are emotional states that cause physical and
<font color="#a9a9a9">psychological </font>changes that influence our
behaviour. The physiology of emotions is closely related to the
arousal of the <font color="#dcdcdc">nervous system</font>, and
different states and intensities of arousal appear to be associated
with specific emotions. Emotions are also related to behavioural
tendencies. <font color="#2f4f4f">Extroverts are </font>more likely
to be social and express their feelings, while <font color="#556b2f">introverts
are </font>more likely to be socially withdrawn and hide their
feelings. Emotions are often the driving force <font color="#6b8e23">behind
motivation</font>, both positive and negative. The definition is
described as &quot;a positive or negative experience associated with
a particular pattern of physiological activity&quot;. According to
other theories, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes
of components, which may include <font color="#a0522d">motivation</font>,
emotion, behaviour and <font color="#228b22">physiological </font>changes,
but none of these components is an emotion. Nor is emotion the entity
that causes these components</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman's
biological perspective, but developed a &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">wheel
of emotions&quot; </font>proposing <font color="#dcdcdc">eight
</font>primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy
and sadness, anger and fear, <font color="#2f4f4f">trust </font>and
disgust, and <font color="#556b2f">surprise </font>and anticipation.
Some basic emotions can be transformed into complex emotions. Complex
emotions can arise from cultural conditioning or association with
basic emotions. Alternatively, in the same way that basic emotions
combine, basic emotions can also blend to form the full spectrum of
human emotional experiences. For example, interpersonal hatred and
disgust could combine <font color="#6b8e23">to form contempt</font>.
There are relationships between basic emotions that lead to positive
or negative effects.</p>

emotions originated in the late <font color="#dcdcdc">19th century
</font>with Charles Darwin's book <font color="#2f4f4f">The
Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</font>, which argued
that emotions had a purpose for humans, as they served <font color="#556b2f">communication
</font>and also aided survival. Darwin therefore argued that emotions
have evolved through <font color="#6b8e23">natural selection </font>and
therefore have universal cross-cultural equivalents. Darwin also
explained in detail the virtues of experiencing emotions and the
parallel experiences in animals. This paved the way for the animal
study of emotions and eventually for the determination of the neural
basis of emotions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">An example of this theory would be
the following: an emotional <font color="#a9a9a9">stimulus </font>(a
snake) triggers <font color="#dcdcdc">a physiological </font>response
(increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.) which <font color="#2f4f4f">is
interpreted as </font><font color="#556b2f">a specific emotion

desired emotional state is induced by manipulation of the body state.
Some people may believe that emotions cause emotional responses: for
example, &quot;I cry because I am sad&quot; or &quot;I ran away
because I was scared&quot;. The problem with James-Lange's theory is

incorporated into the two-factor theory, several theories began to
argue that cognitive activity in the form of <font color="#a9a9a9">judgments</font>,
evaluations or thoughts was absolutely necessary for emotion to
arise. One of the most important proponents of this view was <font color="#dcdcdc">Richard

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Perceptual theories use either one
or more perceptions to find the emotion (Goldie, 2007).A recent
combination of somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is
<font color="#dcdcdc">perception theory</font>. This theory is
neo-Jamesian in its assertion that bodily responses are central to
emotions, but it nevertheless emphasizes the relevance of emotions or
the idea that emotions are about something, as cognitive theories
recognize. The novel claim of this theory is that concept-based
cognition is redundant to such meaningfulness. Rather, embodied
changes themselves detect the meaningful content of emotion because
they are causally triggered by specific situations. In this respect,
emotions are seen as analogous to faculties such as sight or touch,
which provide information about the relationship between the subject
and the world in different ways. For a sophisticated defence of this
view, see the book <font color="#6b8e23">Gut Reactions by </font><font color="#2f4f4f">philosopher

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A common way in which emotions are
conceptualized in sociology is through multidimensional features,
including cultural or emotional markers (e.g. anger, pride, <font color="#a9a9a9">fear,
</font>happiness), physiological changes (e.g. increased sweating,
<font color="#dcdcdc">changes in </font>pulse rate), expressive
facial and body movements (e.g. smiling, frowning, <font color="#2f4f4f">baring
teeth</font>), and evaluations of situational cues. <font color="#556b2f">Jonathan
Turner </font>(2007: 2009) has developed one comprehensive theory of
human emotional arousal. In this theory, the two key factors of
emotional arousal are expectation states and consequences. When
people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations about
how the encounter should unfold, they experience different emotions
depending on the extent to which expectations about themselves,
others and the situation are or are not met. People can also give
positive or negative consequences, directed at themselves or at
others, which also trigger different emotional experiences in
individuals. Turner analyses a wide range of emotional theories from
various fields of research, including sociology, psychology,
evolutionary science and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he
identified <font color="#6b8e23">four </font>emotions that all
researchers attribute to human neurology, including
reassurance-danger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness and
disappointment-sadness. These <font color="#a0522d">four </font>categories
are called primary emotions, and researchers agree to some extent
that these primary emotions combine to produce more sophisticated and
complex emotional experiences. These more complex emotions are called
first-order elaborations in Turner's theory, and include emotions
such as pride, elation and a sense of awe. Emotions can also be
experienced at different levels of intensity, so that feelings of
worry are a low-intensity variant of the primary emotion of disgust
and fear, while depression is a higher-intensity variant.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 19th century, the most
influential theorists were William James (1842-1910) and <font color="#a9a9a9">Carl
Lange </font>(1834-1900). James was an <font color="#2f4f4f">American
</font>psychologist and <font color="#556b2f">philosopher who </font>wrote
on educational psychology, the psychology of religious
experience/mysticism and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a
<font color="#6b8e23">Danish </font>physician and psychologist.
Working independently, they developed <font color="#228b22">James-Lange's
theory</font>, the hypothesis of the origin and nature of emotions.
According to this theory, the human autonomic nervous system
generates physiological events such as muscle tension, heart rate
increases, sweating and dry mouth in response to experiences in the
world. Emotions are therefore feelings that arise as a result of
these physiological changes and are not the cause of them.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The emotion-based perspective,
developed by <font color="#a9a9a9">Paul E. Griffiths </font>and
Andrea Scarantino, emphasises the importance of <font color="#dcdcdc">external
</font>factors in the development and communication of emotions and
is based on <font color="#2f4f4f">a situationist </font>approach to
psychology. This theory differs markedly from cognitivist and
neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a
purely internal process, with the environment acting only as a
stimulus to emotion. In contrast, <font color="#556b2f">the
situationist </font>view of emotions sees emotions as the result of
exploring one's environment and observing the reactions of other
organisms. Emotion stimulates the development of social relationships
and acts as a signal that mediates the behaviour of other organisms.
In some contexts, the expression of emotions (both voluntary and
involuntary) can be seen as a strategic move in transactions between
different organisms. According to the embedded perspective,
conceptual thinking is not inherent to emotions, because emotions are
an action-oriented form of skilled engagement with the world.

The pioneering work of Broca (<font color="#a9a9a9">1878</font>),

that emotions are associated with a group of limbic systems in the

in areas such as <font color="#a9a9a9">ethics</font>, the philosophy
of art (for example, sensory-emotional values and matters of taste
and feeling) and the philosophy of music (see also Music and
emotions). In history, scholars study documents and other sources to
interpret and analyse past actions; speculation about the emotional
state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of
interpretation. In literature and filmmaking, the expression of
emotions is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama and
<font color="#dcdcdc">romance.</font> In communication studies,
researchers explore the role of emotions in the transmission of ideas

can refer to states that are mild (such as annoyed or happy) and
states that are not directed at anything (such as anxiety and

emotion, cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations or
thoughts is necessary for an emotion to arise. One prominent
philosophical proponent is <font color="#a9a9a9">Robert C. Solomon
</font>(e.g., The Passions, Emotions and the Meaning of Life,<font color="#dcdcdc">1993
</font>). Solomon argues that emotions are <font color="#2f4f4f">judgments</font>.
He has put forward a more nuanced view in response to what he has
called the &quot;standard objection&quot; to <font color="#556b2f">cognitivism</font>,
the idea that a judgment that something is frightening can occur
either with or without emotion, so that the judgment cannot be
identified with emotion. Another example is the theory put forward by

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Emotions can motivate social
interactions and relationships, and are therefore directly linked to
basic physiology, in particular stress systems. This is important
because emotions are linked to the anti-stress complex, which
involves the oxytocin attachment system, which plays an important
role in attachment. Emotional phenotypic temperaments influence
social cohesion and fitness in complex social systems (<font color="#a9a9a9">Kurt
Kortschal </font>2013). These traits are shared with other species
and taxa, and result from the effects of genes and their continuous
transmission. The information encoded in DNA sequences provides a
model for assembling the proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes
need genetic information <font color="#2f4f4f">from their parents'
gametes</font>, and in each speciation event, inherited traits that
enabled the ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed
on, along with new traits that may be potentially useful to
offspring. In the <font color="#556b2f">five </font>million years
since the lineages that led to modern humans and chimpanzees split,
only about <font color="#6b8e23">1.2% of </font>their genetic
material has changed. This suggests that everything that
distinguishes us from chimpanzees is encoded in that very small
amount of DNA, including our behaviour. Students studying animal
behaviour have only found within-species examples of gene-dependent
behavioural phenotypes. In the mole rat (Microtus spp.), minor
genetic differences in the vasopressin receptor gene have been found
that correspond to large species differences in social organization
and mating system (Hammock &amp; Young 2005). Another possible
example of behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is
involved in neural circuits that process speech and language
(Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its current form in humans differs from
the chimpanzee gene by only a few mutations and has been present for
about <font color="#228b22">200</font><font color="#a0522d">,000
</font><font color="#228b22">years</font>, coinciding with the
beginning of modern human evolution (Enard et al. 2002). Speech,
language and social organisation are all part of the basis of
emotions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In everyday language, an emotion is
any relatively brief conscious experience characterised by intense
mental activity and intense pleasure or dissatisfaction. The
scientific debate has drifted into other meanings and there is no
consensus on a definition. Emotions are often intertwined with mood,
temperament, <font color="#a9a9a9">personality</font>, disposition
and motivation. In some theories, <font color="#dcdcdc">cognition </font>is
an important component of emotion. People who act primarily on
emotion may appear not to think, but mental processes are still
essential, especially in interpreting events. For example, the
awareness of danger and the subsequent arousal of the <font color="#556b2f">nervous
system </font>(e.g. <font color="#6b8e23">rapid heartbeat and
breathing</font><font color="#a0522d">, sweating, muscle tension</font>)

facial muscles to match different facial expressions (e.g., disgust),
they reported subjective and physiological experiences that

emotions are secondary to physiological phenomena. In his theory,
James argued that the observation of what he called an 'exciting

explain the different emotional experiences, James proposed that
stimuli trigger activity in the <font color="#2f4f4f">autonomic

experience in the brain. A similar theory was also proposed at about

become an increasingly popular topic, with some scholars arguing that
it is an essential category of analysis, like class, race or <font color="#a9a9a9">gender</font>.
Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions,
feelings and their expressions are regulated differently across
cultures and historical periods, and <font color="#dcdcdc">the
constructivist </font>school of history even argues that some
emotions and meta-emotions, such as <font color="#2f4f4f">Schadenfreude</font>,
are learned and not simply regulated by culture. Historians of
emotions trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of emotions
and examine emotional systems, codes and vocabularies from the
perspective of social, cultural or political history. Others focus on
the history of medicine, science or psychology. What someone can and
should feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people
or things, depends on social norms and rules. It is therefore
historically variable and open to change. Several research centres

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Stanley Schachter based his theory
on the earlier work of <font color="#a9a9a9">Spanish </font>doctor
<font color="#dcdcdc">Gregorio Marañón, who </font>injected
patients with <font color="#2f4f4f">adrenaline </font>and then asked
them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these
patients felt something, but because there was no actual emotional
stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological
excitement as an emotion they were experiencing. Schachter did agree
that physiological reactions played a major role in emotions. He
suggested that physiological reactions contributed to the emotional
experience by facilitating a targeted cognitive appraisal of a
specific physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal
determined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus
the result of a two-step process: general physiological arousal and
the experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal,
the heart pounding, in response to the arousing stimulus of seeing a
bear in the kitchen. The brain then rapidly scans the area to explain
the heart palpitations and notices the bear. Thus, the brain
interprets the heartbeat as being due to fear of the bear. With his
student <font color="#556b2f">Jerome Singer, </font>Schachter showed
that subjects can have different emotional reactions even when put in
the same physiological state by an adrenaline injection. Subjects
were found to express either anger or amusement, depending on whether
the other person in the situation (the confederate) was showing the
emotion. Thus, the combination of situational judgement (cognitive)
and participants' receipt of adrenaline or placebo together
determined the response. This experiment has been criticized by Jesse
Prinz (<font color="#6b8e23">2004</font>) Gut Reactions.</p>

</font>sociologists focused on different aspects of certain emotions
and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992),
<font color="#dcdcdc">pride and shame </font>were the main emotions
that lead people to engage in various social actions. He suggested
that in every encounter we observe ourselves through a &quot;looking
glass&quot; provided by the gestures and reactions of others.
Depending on these reactions, we experience either pride or shame,
and this leads to certain behaviours. <font color="#2f4f4f">Retzinger

<font color="#a9a9a9">computer science</font>, engineering,
psychology and neuroscience has been pursuing the development of
devices that recognise human emotion and model human emotions. <font color="#dcdcdc">In
computer science, </font>affective computing is a branch of AI
research and development that deals with the design of systems and
devices that can recognise, interpret and process human emotions. It
is an interdisciplinary field that includes computer science,
psychology and cognitive science. Although its roots can be traced
back to early philosophical studies of emotions, the more modern
branch of computer science was inspired by <font color="#2f4f4f">Rosalind
Picard's 1995 paper </font>on affective computing. The perception of
affective information starts with <font color="#556b2f">passive

collected corresponds to cues that people use to detect other
people's emotions. Another aspect of affective computing is the
design of computer devices that either have innate emotional
capabilities or are capable of convincingly simulating emotions.

in slightly different ways depending on the academic discipline. In
psychology and philosophy, emotion typically involves a subjective,
conscious experience characterised primarily by <font color="#a0522d">psychophysiological
</font>expressions, biological responses and mental states. A similar

</font>communication-based theory developed by <font color="#a9a9a9">Howard
M. Weiss </font>and Russell Cropanzano (<font color="#dcdcdc">1996</font>)
that examines the causes, structures and consequences of emotional
experiences (especially in the work environment). According to this
theory, emotions are influenced and triggered by events, which in
turn influence attitudes and behaviour. This theoretical framework
also emphasises time in the sense that people experience what are
known as emotional episodes - &quot;a series of emotional states that
span time and are organised around an underlying theme&quot;. This
theory has been used by a number of researchers to better understand
emotions from a communication perspective, and was explored in more
detail by <font color="#556b2f">Howard M. Weiss </font>and Daniel J.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Emotions often seek to be regulated
by social conventions and situations, based on multiple (sometimes
conflicting) demands and expectations from different quarters. In
many cultures, girls and women are denied the emotion of <font color="#a9a9a9">anger</font>,
while boys and men are denied the emotion of <font color="#dcdcdc">fear.</font>
Social role expectations, such as &quot;acting like a man&quot;
rather than a woman, and the associated &quot;emotional rules&quot;
contribute to differences in the expression of certain emotions. Some
cultures encourage or discourage joy, sadness or jealousy, and the
free expression of feelings of <font color="#2f4f4f">disgust </font>is
considered socially inappropriate in most cultures. Some social
institutions are considered to be based on a particular emotion, as
in the <font color="#556b2f">case of </font>love in the modern
<font color="#556b2f">institution of marriage.</font> In advertising,

failed because Everton were unable to raise the <font color="#2f4f4f">£30

proposal was rejected by the council in <font color="#556b2f">2003.</font>
At the initiative of Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development
Corporation, the club entered into negotiations with Liverpool F.C.
in late 2004 to share the proposed stadium at Stanley Park.
Negotiations broke down because Everton could not raise <font color="#6b8e23">50%

However, most of the Latin-based words (mainly <font color="#228b22">from

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The strength of the Viking influence
on Old English is evident from the fact that the essential elements
of the language - pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs
(such as &quot;therefore&quot; and &quot;together&quot;),
conjunctions and prepositions - show the most obvious <font color="#a9a9a9">Danish
</font>influence; the best evidence of Scandinavian influence is
found in the extensive word lists, since, as Jespersen points out,
there are no texts from this period, either in Scandinavia or in
northern England, that provide definitive evidence of influence on
syntax. The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantial,
pervasive and democratic in nature. <font color="#dcdcdc">Old Norse
</font>and <font color="#2f4f4f">Old English </font>closely resembled
each other like cousins, and because they had some words in common,
they roughly understood each other; over time, inflectional forms
melted away and an analytical pattern emerged. It is very &quot;important
to recognise that for many words, English and Scandinavian differ
mainly in <font color="#6b8e23">their inflectional parts</font>. The
body of the word was so nearly the same in both languages that only
the endings presented obstacles to mutual understanding. <font color="#a0522d">In
the confused population of Danela, </font>these endings must have
caused much confusion, and they gradually became blurred and
eventually disappeared.&quot; This mixing of peoples and languages
fortunately led to 'the simplification of English grammar'.</p>

Norse loanwords are relatively rare in Old English literature, and

the literary standard was based on a West German dialect far from the
main Scandinavian area of influence; the influence of Norwegian may
have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. The Middle
English texts, which are more often based on Eastern dialects,
certainly show a strong Norwegian influence. Modern English contains

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This new importance of naval
aviation forced nations to establish several aircraft carriers to
provide each large fleet with air superiority protection against
enemy aircraft. This extensive use required the construction of
several new &quot;light&quot; aircraft carriers. Escort carriers,
such as the USS Bogue, were sometimes built for the purpose, but most
were converted from merchant ships as a temporary measure to provide
anti-submarine warfare air support for convoys and amphibious
operations. Following this concept, the US-built <font color="#dcdcdc">light
</font>aircraft carriers, such as the USS Independence, represented a
larger and more 'militarised' version of the escort carrier. Although
they had a similar complement to escort carriers, they had the
advantage of <font color="#2f4f4f">speed </font>due to their modified
cruiser hulls. The UK 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier was designed
for rapid construction by civilian dockers and had an expected
service life of about <font color="#556b2f">three years. </font>They
served <font color="#6b8e23">the Royal Navy </font>during the war,
and were chosen as the hull of almost all aircraft carrier fleets
after the war until the 1980s. Emergencies also encouraged the
creation or conversion of highly unconventional aircraft carriers.
CAMs were merchant ships carrying cargo, capable of launching (but
not retrieving) a single fighter aircraft from a catapult to defend
their convoy from long-range German aircraft.</p>

fixed-wing aircraft in 1903 was closely followed by the first
experimental take-off in 1910 from the deck of a US Navy ship (the
cruiser USS Birmingham), and the first experimental landings in <font color="#2f4f4f">1911</font>.
The first take-off from a ship underway was made on 9 May 1912 from
the deck of the British Royal Navy ship HMS Hibernia. The next in
line were seaplane carriers, the first of which was the French Foudre
in 1911. In September 1914, Wakamiya of the Imperial Japanese Navy
carried out the <font color="#556b2f">world's first successful
ship-to-ship air attack</font>: on 6 September 1914, a Farman
aircraft launched by Wakamiya attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser
SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth and the German gunboat Jaguar in Kiaochow Bay
off Tsingtao; neither was hit. The first air attack from an aircraft
carrier was <font color="#a0522d">the Tondern raid in July 1918</font>,
when seven Sopwith Camels launched from the converted battlecruiser
HMS Furious damaged a German air base at Tønder and destroyed two

carrier </font>dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, as
air power was becoming a major factor in the war effort. The
emergence of aircraft as a key weapon was due to the <font color="#2f4f4f">superior

aircraft carriers. <font color="#556b2f">Their range and accuracy
were greater </font>than that of naval guns, making them highly
effective. The versatility of aircraft carriers was demonstrated in
November 1940 when HMS Illustrious sent a long-range strike against
the Italian fleet at its base at Taranto, marking <font color="#6b8e23">the
beginning of effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes</font>.
This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at the
expense of two torpedo bombers. In World War II, the Pacific was the
scene of clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The surprise
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was a clear demonstration
that modern aircraft carriers had great capabilities that could be
used to increase power. The consolidation of six aircraft carriers
into a single unit turned naval history on its head, as no other
nation had anything like it at its disposal. However, the
vulnerability of aircraft carriers compared to conventional
battleships when engaged in combat at gunpoint was quickly
demonstrated when <font color="#a0522d">the HMS Glorious was sunk by

and several navies ordered and built warships deliberately designed
to operate as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s, resulting in the
introduction of such ships as Hōshō (1922), HMS Hermes (1924) and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors
Charalambe &quot;Bobby&quot; Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, claimed
in 2007 that Boutris said he tried to ground a Southwest plane after
finding <font color="#dcdcdc">cracks in the fuselage, but was </font>stopped
by supervisors who he said were friendly with the airline. This was
confirmed by a Department of Transportation report which found that
FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly planes46 that were
overdue for safety inspections in 2006 and 2007, ignoring concerns
raised by inspectors. Inspections of other airlines resulted in <font color="#556b2f">two
</font>airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of
flight cancellations. The House of Representatives Transport and
Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Former
Committee Chairman <font color="#6b8e23">Jim Oberstar </font>stated
that the Committee's investigation revealed regulatory abuses and
widespread regulatory failures that allowed aircraft117 to be
operated commercially even though they did not comply with FAA safety
rules. Oberstar said there was a &quot;culture of convenience&quot;
between senior FAA officials and airlines and that the FAA's culture
was &quot;systematically broken&quot;, leading to &quot;abuses that
bordered on corruption&quot;. In 2008, the FAA proposed fining
Southwest <font color="#228b22">$10.2 million for </font>failing to
inspect older aircraft for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA
agreed that Southwest would pay a <font color="#191970">$7.5 million
</font>fine and implement new safety procedures, with the fine
doubling if Southwest failed to comply.</p>

airlines a reason to take a chance and get caught. He also said the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Lancashire had a vibrant choral
culture and classical music, with a very large number of local church
choirs from the 17th century onwards, leading to the formation of
local choral societies from the mid-19th century onwards. These
societies often focused on performing the music of Handel and his
contemporaries. It also played a major role in the development of
wind orchestras, which sprang up in the county, particularly in the
textile and coal fields, in the 19th century. The first open wind
band competition was held <font color="#a9a9a9">in Manchester </font>in
<font color="#dcdcdc">1853 </font>and continued annually until the
1980s. The region's vibrant brass band culture played a major role in
the establishment and staffing of the Hallé Orchestra, the oldest
existing professional orchestra in the UK, from 1857. The same local
musical tradition has produced notable figures such as Sir William
Walton (1902-88), son of the choirmaster and music teacher of <font color="#2f4f4f">Oldham</font>,
<font color="#556b2f">Sir Thomas Beecham </font>(1879-1961), born in

founder of <font color="#228b22">the London Sinfonietta, was </font>born
in <font color="#191970">Blackpool </font>in 1944. Lancashire also
produced more populist figures, such as Southport-born early musical

who began his musical career as organist at Salford Cathedral.</p>

</font>produced several nationally and internationally successful
popular singers in the 1950s, including traditional pop stars Frankie
Vaughan and <font color="#dcdcdc">Lita Roza</font>, and one of the
most successful British rock and roll stars, Billy Fury. Many
Lancashire towns had a vibrant skiffle culture in the late 1950s,
from which by the early 1960s a thriving beat band culture began to
emerge, particularly around Liverpool and Manchester. It is estimated
that there were around 350 bands in and around Liverpool during this
period, often performing in dance halls, concert halls and clubs,
including the Beatles. Following the Beatles' nationwide success from
<font color="#556b2f">1962</font>, several Liverpool performers were
able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry &amp; the
Pacemakers, The Searchers and Cilla Black. The first acts to make
their breakthrough in the UK that were not from Liverpool or managed
by Brian Epstein were <font color="#6b8e23">Freddie and the Dreamers,
</font><font color="#a0522d">based in Manchester</font>, and Herman's
Hermits and the Hollies. Led by the Beatles, beat bands from the
region led the British invasion of the United States, which had a
major impact on the development of rock music. After the waning of
the beat bands in the late 1960s, the centre of rock culture shifted
to London, and local bands rose to national prominence relatively
infrequently until the disco-funk culture and the punk-rock
revolution of the mid- to late 1970s.</p>

with several local Wassailing songs. During the Industrial

arose to fill the void left by the extinction of the Jurassic and
Cretaceous periods. The most successful was <font color="#a0522d">Iguanodon</font>,
which spread to all continents. The seasons came back into force and
the polar regions became colder with the seasons, but dinosaurs
continued to inhabit this region, such as <font color="#228b22">Leaellynasaurus</font>,
which lived in the polar forests all year round, and many dinosaurs
migrated there in summer, such as Muttaburrasaurus. Because it was
too cold for crocodiles, it was the last stronghold of large
amphibians like <font color="#191970">Koolasuchus</font>. Pterosaurs
grew as species like Tapejara and Ornithocheirus evolved.</p>

of a Julian year is 365.25 days, <font color="#556b2f">the Julian

than the average tropical year. This difference causes a difference

Lilius' proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see
Accuracy). By the time of Gregorian reform after the Council of
Nicaea, a 10-day anomaly had already occurred, causing the <font color="#228b22">vernal

</font>instead of the ecclesiastically fixed <font color="#8b0000">March

However, the Church of Rome still kept the <font color="#228b22">25th
of March </font>as the equinox (until 342) and used a different cycle
to calculate the lunar day. Since the 14th day of Easter could not
fall earlier than 21 March in the Alexandrian system, its first day
could fall no earlier than 8 March and no later than 5 April. This
meant that Easter alternated between 22 March and 25 April. In Rome,
Easter could not fall later than 21 April, as it was the Roman
Parilia, or birthday, and a pagan festival.The first day of Easter
could fall no earlier than 5 March and no later than 2 April.</p>

14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold). All values are

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Xbox 360, known during development
as Xbox Next, Xenon, Xbox 2, Xbox FS or NextBox, was developed in
early 2003. In February 2003, the design of the Xenon software
platform, led by Microsoft's Executive Vice President <font color="#a9a9a9">J
Allard, </font>began. In the same month, Microsoft held an event for
developers400 <font color="#2f4f4f">in Bellevue, Washington </font>to
recruit support for the system. In the same month, Peter Moore,
former head of <font color="#556b2f">Sega of America, </font>joined
Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, <font color="#6b8e23">ATI committed to
</font>manufacture a graphics processor for the new console, and the
contract was announced two days later. Prior to the launch of the
Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were seen using <font color="#a0522d">Apple's
</font><font color="#228b22">Power Mac G5 </font>hardware. This was
because the system's PowerPC 970 processor ran the same PowerPC
architecture that would eventually be used in the Xbox 360 <font color="#191970">on
IBM's Xenon processor.</font> The Xenon processor cores were
developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's
Cell Processor PPE architecture. According to <font color="#8b0000">David
Shippy and Mickie Phipps</font>, IBM employees were 'hiding' their
work from Sony and Toshiba, who were IBM's partners in the
development of the Cell processor. Jeff Minter created the music
visualisation software Neon, which is included with the Xbox 360.</p>

</font>named the Xbox 360 as the sixth best video game console of all
time, and it was voted the <font color="#dcdcdc">25th best </font>selling
console of the seventh generation. Although not the best-selling
console of the seventh generation, <font color="#2f4f4f">TechRadar
</font>considered the Xbox 360 the <font color="#556b2f">most
influential </font>because it emphasized digital media distribution
and online gaming through Xbox Live, as well as popularizing gaming
achievement awards. PC Magazine saw the Xbox 360 as a prototype for
<font color="#6b8e23">online gaming</font>, as it &quot;proved that
online gaming communities can thrive in the console space&quot;. Five
years after the original debut of the Xbox 360, the highly acclaimed
Kinect motion capture camera was released, setting a record for the
fastest-selling consumer electronics device in history and extending
the life of the console. <font color="#228b22">Edge </font>ranked the
Xbox 360 as the second best console of 1993-2013, stating, &quot;It
had its own social network, in-game chat, new indie games every week
and the best version of almost every multi-format game...&quot;.
<font color="#191970">Killzone </font>is not Halo and nowadays Gran
Turismo is not Forza, but it's not about exclusives - after all,
there's nothing that tops Naughty Dog's PS3 output. Rather, it's
about the choices Microsoft made during the lifetime of the original
Xbox. A PC-like architecture meant that early EA Sports games ran at
60 frames per second while on the PS3 it was only 30 frames per
second, Xbox Live meant that every dedicated gamer had an existing
friends list, and Halo meant that Microsoft had a next-gen exclusive
that killed. And when developers demo games on PC today, they do it
on the 360 pad - another industry benchmark, and a crucial one.&quot;</p>

Microsoft has tried to change the console to improve its reliability.
Changes include <font color="#a9a9a9">reducing the number, size and
placement of components</font>, adding <font color="#dcdcdc">epoxy
patches to </font><font color="#2f4f4f">the corners and edges of the
</font><font color="#556b2f">processor and graphics card </font>as an
adhesive to prevent movement against the board during thermal
expansion, and a second <font color="#a0522d">graphics card heat sink
</font>to dissipate more heat. With the release of the redesigned
Xbox 360 S, the warranty on newer models will not include a
<font color="#228b22">three-year extended warranty against &quot;general
hardware defects&quot;. The </font>newer Xbox 360 S model will
indicate <font color="#191970">system overheating </font>when the
console's power button starts flashing red, unlike previous models
where, in the event of overheating, the <font color="#8b0000">first
and third quarters of the </font>ring around the power button <font color="#8b0000">would
light up </font>red. The system warns the user of <font color="#483d8b">an
impending system shutdown until the system has cooled down</font>,
while the power button flashing between <font color="#3cb371">green

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By far the largest military action
in which the United States was involved during this period was the
<font color="#dcdcdc">War of 1812</font>. Britain was locked in a
<font color="#556b2f">major war with Napoleonic France, and </font>its
policy was to block American supplies to France. The United States
sought to remain neutral while engaging in foreign trade. Britain cut
off trade and took sailors from American ships into the Royal Navy,
despite strong objections. Britain supported the <font color="#6b8e23">Indian
rebellion </font>in the American Midwest with the aim of creating an
Indian nation there to prevent US expansion. The United States
eventually declared war on <font color="#228b22">the United Kingdom
</font>in 1812, the first time the United States had officially
declared war. With no hope of defeating the Royal Navy, the United
States attacked the British Empire <font color="#191970">by invading
British Canada, hoping to use the captured territory as a bargaining
chip.</font> The invasion of Canada was a disaster, although
simultaneous wars with the Indians on the western front (the Tecumseh
War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon
in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to attack New York, raid
Washington and seize the central Mississippi River in New Orleans.
The invasion of New York was a fiasco after a much larger British
army withdrew to Canada. The invaders managed to burn Washington on
25 August 1814, but were repulsed in the Chesapeake Bay campaign at
the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander was killed. The
major invasion of Louisiana was halted in a one-sided military battle
in which three top British generals and thousands of soldiers were
killed. The victors were Major General Andrew Jackson, who commanded
the Battle of New Orleans and became President, and the Americans,
who basked in their victory against a much stronger country. The
peace treaty proved successful and the United States and Britain
never went to war again. The losers were the Indians, who never got
the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.</p>

Root </font>(1899-1904) led the modernisation of the army. General
Nelson A. Miles thwarted his goal of a uniformed chief of staff as
general officer and a European-style general staff for planning, but
he succeeded in expanding <font color="#dcdcdc">West Point </font>and
establishing the US Army War College and <font color="#2f4f4f">General

for specialised branches. He also developed <font color="#6b8e23">the
principle of rotating officers from staff to line</font>. Concerned
about the role of the army in the administration of the new
territories acquired in 1898, Root drew up procedures for the

to remain <font color="#a9a9a9">neutral </font>when the First World
War broke out in <font color="#dcdcdc">August 1914</font>, but as a
neutral party it insisted on its right to protection from German
submarine attacks, even though its ships carried food and raw
materials to Britain. In <font color="#2f4f4f">1917, the Germans
</font>continued <font color="#556b2f">their submarine raids</font>,
knowing that this would lead to US annexation. When the US declared
war, the US army was still small by European standards, and
mobilisation would take a year. Meanwhile, the US continued to supply
supplies and money to Britain and France and began the first
<font color="#6b8e23">peacetime conscription</font>. Industrial
mobilisation took longer than expected, so divisions were sent to
Europe without equipment, relying instead on Britain and France to
supply it.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The memories and lessons of the war
are still a major factor in US politics. The other side sees the war
as a necessary part of a policy of containment that allowed the enemy
to choose the time and place of warfare. Others argue that the US
made significant strategic gains by defeating the communists <font color="#dcdcdc">in
Indonesia, </font>and by 1972 both Moscow and Beijing were competing
for US support at the expense of their allies in Hanoi. Critics see
the conflict as a <font color="#2f4f4f">&quot;</font><font color="#556b2f">quagmire</font>&quot;
- an endless waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that
did not involve US interests. Fear of a new quagmire has been a major
factor in foreign policy debates ever since. Conscription became
highly unpopular, and <font color="#6b8e23">President Nixon </font>ended
it in <font color="#a0522d">1973</font>, forcing the military
(especially the Army) to rely entirely on volunteers. This raised the
question of how well professional soldiers reflected American society
and values as a whole; soldiers generally felt that their service
represented the highest and best of American values.</p>

fighting was in air and ground battles in Iraq, Kuwait and the border

and decisive war, marked by rapid and overwhelming American victories
on land and sea against Spain. The navy was well prepared, and won
laurel prizes, even as politicians tried (and failed) to get it
deployed to defend east coast cities against potential threats from
Spain's weak navy. The army did well in the fighting <font color="#a9a9a9">in

west and was less prepared for an overseas conflict. It relied on

posts. The US liberated Cuba (after the US military occupation).

after the war began, and its growing submarine fleet. The Navy and
Marines then continued their island-hopping campaign in the central
and southern Pacific from 1943-45, reaching the outskirts of Japan in
the Battle of Okinawa. In 1942 and 1943, the United States sent

paralleled the Soviet invasion from the east. This led to the

States did well in naval campaigns during 1944, but bloody battles on

MacArthur </font>as commander of its forces, and the UN, US and
Korean forces held a perimeter around <font color="#2f4f4f">Pusan</font>,
giving time for reinforcements. MacArthur boldly but riskily ordered
<font color="#556b2f">an amphibious assault </font>behind Inchon's
front line, cut off and diverted the North Koreans and quickly
crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to
advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the
Chinese crossed the <font color="#a0522d">Yalu River </font>in
October and launched surprise attacks that sent UN forces plunging
back across the 38th parallel. Truman originally wanted a rollback
strategy to unify Korea, but after the Chinese success he ended up
with a containment policy to divide the country. <font color="#228b22">MacArthur
</font>supported the Rollback policy, but President Harry Truman
dismissed him after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace talks
dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower
threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly
concluded, leaving the Koreas divided at the 38th parallel. North and
South Korea are still at war, having never signed a peace treaty, and
American troops are still stationed in South Korea as part of US
foreign policy.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, the battle was one-sided
almost from the start. War strategists and scholars constantly
studied the reasons for this. It is generally agreed that <font color="#a9a9a9">US
technological superiority </font>was the decisive factor, but the
speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse was also due to <font color="#dcdcdc">poor
strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among </font>Iraqi
troops as a result of previous incompetent leadership. After the
devastating initial attacks on Iraq's air defences and command and
control installations on <font color="#556b2f">17 January </font><font color="#2f4f4f">1991</font>,
coalition forces almost immediately achieved full air superiority.
The Iraqi air force was destroyed in a matter of days and some
aircraft fled to Iran where they were interned for the duration of
the conflict. The superior technological advantages of the United
States, such as stealth aircraft and infrared radars, quickly turned
the air war into a &quot;turkey shoot&quot;. The heat signature of
any tank that started its engine made it an easy target. Air defence
radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired by wild
weaver aircraft. The grainy video footage captured by the missiles'
beak cameras as they targeted impossibly small targets was a staple
of US news broadcasts, revealing to the world a new kind of war that
some likened to a video game. For six weeks, as planes and
helicopters relentlessly pounded Iraq, the Iraqi army was almost
completely defeated, but it did not retreat at the behest of <font color="#6b8e23">Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein</font>, and when ground troops invaded the
country on <font color="#a0522d">24 February</font>, many Iraqi
troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in
one case, Iraqi troops tried to surrender to a group of television
cameras advancing with coalition forces.</p>

states had the resources to adequately equip the soldiers with

a better idea of how to win the war </font><font color="#2f4f4f">than
they did</font>. The British sent four invading armies. Washington's
strategy forced the First Army out of Boston in 1776 and was
responsible for the surrender of the Second and Third Armies at
<font color="#556b2f">Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781).</font> He
limited British control to New York and a few places while keeping
the Patriots in control of most of the population. The Loyalists, in
whom the British had placed too much trust, made up about <font color="#6b8e23">20%
of </font>the population, but were never well organised. At the end
of the war, Washington watched with pride as the last British army

leadership with it. Washington stunned the world when, instead of a

</font>Revolution was accompanied by a civil war in which hundreds of
thousands of people died and large numbers fled the battlefields.
Tens of thousands fled to the United States. President Wilson sent US
troops to occupy the city of <font color="#dcdcdc">Veracruz </font>in
Mexico for six months in 1914, in order to show that the US was
interested in the civil war and would not tolerate attacks on
Americans, particularly the Tampico incident of 9 April 1914, when
American sailors were arrested by soldiers of the regime of Mexican
President Victoriano Huerta. In early 1916, Mexican General <font color="#2f4f4f">Pancho
Villa </font>ordered 500 soldiers on a murderous raid on the American
city of Columbus, New Mexico, to rob banks to finance his army. The
<font color="#556b2f">German secret service </font>encouraged <font color="#6b8e23">Pancho
Villa </font>in his raids to involve the US in an intervention in
Mexico that would disrupt the growing US involvement in the war and
divert European aid to support the intervention. Wilson called
together the state militias (National Guard) and sent them and the US
Army, under the command of <font color="#a0522d">General John J.
Pershing, </font>to punish Villa in the Pancho Villa expedition.
Villa, pursued by the Americans, fled deep into Mexico, arousing
Mexican nationalism. By early 1917, President Venustiano Carranza had
brought Villa to heel and secured the border, so Wilson ordered
Pershing to withdraw.</p>

power in the hands of the Chief of Naval Operations and a team of
experts who would develop new strategies, oversee the building of a
larger fleet, coordinate war planning, including force structure,
mobilisation plans and industrial base, and ensure that the US Navy
had the best possible war machines. Eventually, the Navy accepted his
reforms and by 1915 began to reorganise itself for possible

whose stripped-down, riff-heavy, gritty style also appealed to the
punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976,
culminating in the multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock (1977) and
Highway to Hell (1979). The punk ethos also influenced heavy metal
bands such as Motörhead, while <font color="#483d8b">Judas Priest
</font>abandoned the remaining blues elements in their music, further
separating hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create a
new wave of British heavy metal that was continued by bands such as
Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom.</p>

When Wet </font>(1986) mixed hard rock and pop sensibility and spent
a total of eight weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart,
selling <font color="#dcdcdc">12 million </font>copies in the US and
becoming the first hard rock album to produce three top 10 singles,
two of which reached number one. The album is credited with
broadening the genre's audience, particularly by appealing to women
as well as the traditional male-dominated audience, and opening the
door to MTV and commercial success for other bands in the latter part
of the decade. The anthemic <font color="#2f4f4f">The Final Countdown

emergence of more glam-influenced American hard rock bands, and both
Poison and Cinderella released their multi-platinum debut albums in
1986. Van Halen released (<font color="#6b8e23">51501986</font>),
their first album with <font color="#a0522d">Sammy Hagar </font>on

become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Some established bands continued
their commercial success, such as Aerosmith with their multi-platinum
first albums: (<font color="#dcdcdc">1993</font>), which produced
four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album
worldwide (over 10 million copies sold), and Nine Lives (1997). In
<font color="#2f4f4f">1998</font>, Aerosmith released the
chart-topping hit <font color="#556b2f">&quot;I Don't Want to Miss a
Thing&quot;, which </font>remains the only hard rock band single to
debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum <font color="#6b8e23">Ballbreaker
</font>(1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with
songs such as &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; (1992), but also enjoyed
success on adult contemporary radio with the top 10 ballads &quot;Bed
of Roses&quot; (1993) and &quot;Always&quot; (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995
album <font color="#a0522d">These Days </font>was a bigger hit in
Europe than in the US, producing four top 10 singles in the UK
singles chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) both sold
over 4 million copies in the US, and the band developed a more
melodic and blues-rock sound. As the initial momentum of grunge bands
faded in the middle of the decade, <font color="#228b22">post-grunge
bands </font>emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of
grunge, especially the thick, distorted guitars, but their sound was
more radio-friendly and commercial, and they relied more on
traditional hard rock. The most successful bands were Foo Fighters,
Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australian Silverchair and English
Bush, all of whom established <font color="#191970">post-grunge as
one of the </font>most commercially viable subgenres in the late
1990s. Similarly, some post-Oasis post-Britpop bands, such as Feeder
and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or &quot;pop-metal&quot;
sound.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The roots of hard rock go back to
the 1950s, particularly the <font color="#a9a9a9">electric blues</font>,
which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough,
declamatory vocal style, <font color="#dcdcdc">heavy guitar riffs</font>,
string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong rhythm, thick riffs
and attitude-based performances. Electric blues guitarists in the
1950s began experimenting with hard rock elements such as <font color="#2f4f4f">driving
rhythms</font>, distorted guitar solos and power chords, which was
reflected in the work of <font color="#556b2f">Memphis </font>blues
guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and especially <font color="#6b8e23">Pat
Hare, </font>who created a &quot;flashier, meaner, wilder electric
guitar sound&quot; on albums such as James Cotton Cotton Crop Blues
(1954). Other predecessors include <font color="#a0522d">Link </font>Wray's
instrumental &quot;Rumble&quot; in <font color="#228b22">1958</font>,
and <font color="#191970">Dick Dale's </font>surf rock instrumentals
such as <font color="#8b0000">&quot;Let's Go Trippin'&quot; (1961)

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the early 1970s, the Rolling
Stones developed their hard rock sound <font color="#a9a9a9">with
Exile on Main St. </font>(1972). Initially it received mixed reviews,
but <font color="#dcdcdc">according to </font>critic <font color="#dcdcdc">Steve
Erlewine it is </font>now &quot;generally regarded as the Rolling
Stones' best album&quot;. They continued to develop their riff-rich
sound with albums such as It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (1974) and Black
and Blue (1976). Led Zeppelin began mixing elements of world and folk
music into their hard rock with Led Zeppelin III (<font color="#2f4f4f">1970</font>)
and <font color="#556b2f">Led Zeppelin IV </font>(<font color="#6b8e23">1971</font>).
The latter included the song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which
would become the most played song in the history of record radio.
Deep Purple continued to define hard rock, particularly with their
album Machine Head (1972), which included the songs <font color="#a0522d">&quot;Highway
Star&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. </font>In 1975
guitarist <font color="#191970">Ritchie Blackmore </font>left the
band to form Rainbow, and after the band split the following year
singer David Coverdale formed Whitesnake. In 1970 The Who released
Live at Leeds, often considered the archetypal live album of hard
rock, and the following year they released their acclaimed Who's
Next, an album that mixed heavy rock with extensive use of
synthesizers. Subsequent albums, such as Quadrophenia (1973), built
on this sound before Who Are You (1978), their final album before the
death of rock pioneer drummer <font color="#8b0000">Keith Moon </font>later
that year.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The early <font color="#a9a9a9">1980s
</font>saw a number of changes in the personnel and direction of
established hard rock bands, including the deaths of AC/DC singer <font color="#dcdcdc">Bon
Scott </font>and <font color="#556b2f">Led Zeppelin </font>drummer
<font color="#2f4f4f">John Bonham</font>. Zeppelin disbanded almost
immediately afterwards, but AC/DC carried on and recorded the album
<font color="#6b8e23">Back in Black </font>(1980) with new singer
Brian Johnson. It became the fifth best-selling album of all time in
the US and the second best-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath
had parted company with their original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979
and replaced him with <font color="#a0522d">Ronnie James Dio, </font>who
had previously played in Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a
period of creativity and popularity that began with the album Heaven
and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo tour with <font color="#228b22">Blizzard
of Ozz </font>(1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some
bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots towards a
more pop rock sound, while others, such as Rush with Moving Pictures
(1981), began to return to the hard rock sound. From around 1982
onwards, thrash metal, developed in particular by <font color="#191970">Metallica,
Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, which </font>mixed heavy metal with
elements of hardcore punk, helped to create extreme metal and move
the style further away from hard rock, although many of these bands
or their members continued to record some songs that were closer to
the hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots
towards pop metal: first removing their make-up for the 1983 album
Lick It Up, and then adopting the visual look and sound of glam metal
for their 1984 release Animalize, both of which marked a return to
commercial success. Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve
commercial success in hard rock, scoring three consecutive Top 5
albums between 1980 and 1982.</p>

</font>American and British blues and rock bands began to rework rock
and roll by adding louder voices, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic
drumming and louder vocals to electric blues. Early forms of hard
rock can be heard in the output of Chicago blues musicians <font color="#dcdcdc">Elmore
James, Muddy Waters and </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Howlin' Wolf</font>,
in The Kingsmen's version of <font color="#556b2f">&quot;Louie Louie&quot;
</font>(<font color="#6b8e23">1963), </font>which made it a garage
rock standard, and rhythm and blues-influenced British Invasion bands
such as <font color="#a0522d">The Kinks' </font>&quot;You Really Got
Me&quot; (<font color="#228b22">1964</font>), The Who's &quot;<font color="#191970">My

&quot;Shapes of Things&quot; (1966) and The Rolling Stones' &quot;(I
Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; (<font color="#483d8b">1965</font>).
From the late 1960s onwards, it became commonplace to divide
mainstream rock music, which was based on psychedelia, into soft and
hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, which used
acoustic instruments and placed more emphasis on melody and harmony.
Hard rock, on the other hand, was mostly derived from blues rock and
was played louder and more intensely.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although these few hard rock bands
managed to maintain their success and popularity in the early part of
the decade, alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream
success in the form of <font color="#a9a9a9">grunge in the </font>US
and British pop in the UK. This became particularly evident after the
success of Nirvana's <font color="#2f4f4f">Nevermind </font>(1991),
which combined elements of <font color="#556b2f">hardcore punk and
heavy metal into a </font>'dirty' sound that used heavy guitar riffs,
fuzz and feedback, and darker lyrical themes than their 'hair band'
predecessors. While the sound of most <font color="#6b8e23">grunge
bands </font>diverged sharply from mainstream hard rock, several
bands such as <font color="#a0522d">Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains,
Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden </font>drew more heavily from 1970s
and 1980s rock and metal, while <font color="#228b22">Stone Temple
Pilots </font>managed to transform <font color="#191970">alternative

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the United States, macabre rock
pioneer <font color="#a9a9a9">Alice Cooper </font>achieved mainstream
success with his top ten album School's Out (1972). The following
year, blues rockers <font color="#dcdcdc">ZZ Top </font>released
their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith made their eponymous
debut, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk band the
New York Dolls, showing the many directions in which the genre had
evolved. <font color="#2f4f4f">Montrose</font>, which included the
instrumental talents of Ronnie Montrose and the vocals of <font color="#556b2f">Sammy
Hagar </font>and was probably the first all-American hard rock band
to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released its first
album in 1973. <font color="#6b8e23">Kiss </font>drew on the
theatricality of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to
create a unique band personality. Kiss made their commercial
breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in <font color="#a0522d">1975
</font>and <font color="#a0522d">helped </font>hard rock enter the
era of stadium rock. In the mid-1970s, Aerosmith made their
commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975),
which peaked at number 11 on the US album chart, and Rocks (1976),
which peaked at number three. The <font color="#191970">Blue Öyster
Cult</font>, formed in the late 1960s, picked up some of the elements
introduced by Black Sabbath in their breakthrough gold album On Your
Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album
Agents of Fortune (1976), which included the hit single &quot;(Don't
Fear) The Reaper&quot;, which reached <font color="#8b0000">number 12
on the </font>Billboard chart. Journey released its self-titled debut
album in 1975 and the following year Boston released its highly
successful debut album. In the same year, female hard rock bands
enjoyed commercial success with Heart releasing Dreamboat Annie and
The Runaways debuting with their self-titled album. Heart's sound was
more folk-influenced hard rock, while The Runaways leaned more
towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. Emerging from
the Detroit garage rock scene, the Amboy Dukes, best known for their
psychedelic Top 20 hit &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot;
(1968), were broken up by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on
a solo career that led to four consecutive multi-platinum albums
between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best-selling album Double Live
Gonzo (1978).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The established bands made a
comeback of sorts in the mid-1980s. Deep Purple returned after an
<font color="#a9a9a9">8-year </font>hiatus with the classic Machine
Head line-up and produced the album<font color="#dcdcdc"> Perfect
Strangers </font>(1984), which reached number 5 in the UK, top 5 in
five other countries and platinum in the US. After the slightly
slower sales of his fourth album <font color="#2f4f4f">Fair Warning,
</font>Van Halen reached the Top 3 in 1982 with Diver Down and then
reached his commercial peak with <font color="#556b2f">1984</font>.
It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and featured the
song &quot;Jump&quot;, which reached number one on the singles chart
and stayed there for several weeks. After a hiatus for the first half
of the decade, <font color="#6b8e23">Heart </font>made a comeback
with their ninth studio album of the same name, which reached number
one and featured four Top 10 singles, including their first number
one hit. Bands formed in previous decades used video channels with
considerable success. Among the first was ZZ Top, who mixed hard
blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly
successful singles, starting with &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin'&quot;
(1983), which helped their albums Eliminator (<font color="#a0522d">1983</font>)
and Afterburner (1985) reach diamond and multi-platinum status.
Others hit the singles charts again with power ballads like <font color="#228b22">REO
Speedwagon</font>'s &quot;<font color="#191970">Keep on Loving You</font>&quot;
(1980) and &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot; (1984), as well as

metal bands like Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up,

although many of these bands reunited in the late 1990s or early
2000s, they never achieved the commercial success seen in the 1980s
or early 1990s. Other bands, such as Mötley Crüe and Poison,
experienced personnel changes that affected their commercial
viability during the decade. In 1995, Van Halen released the
multi-platinum selling album Balance, which was the band's last with
Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996, David Lee Roth briefly returned, and
his replacement, former Extreme singer <font color="#2f4f4f">Gary
Cherone</font>, was fired shortly after the commercially unsuccessful
1998 release of <font color="#556b2f">Van Halen III</font>, and Van
Halen did not tour or record again until 2004. The original line-up
of Guns N' Roses was downsized throughout the decade. Drummer <font color="#6b8e23">Steven
Adler </font>was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late
1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 1960s, the term <font color="#a9a9a9">heavy
metal </font>was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually
it began to be used to describe music that was played even <font color="#dcdcdc">louder
and stronger</font>. While hard rock retained <font color="#2f4f4f">a
bluesy </font>rock and roll identity, with some swing in the back
beat and riffs that attempted to outline chord progressions in their
hooks, <font color="#556b2f">heavy metal riffs </font>often
functioned <font color="#6b8e23">as stand-alone melodies</font>, with
no swing. Heavy metal took on a &quot;darker&quot; character after
the breakthrough of <font color="#a0522d">Black </font>Sabbath in the
early 1970s. In the 1980s, several subgenres, often referred to as
extreme metal, developed, some of which were influenced by <font color="#228b22">hardcore
punk </font>and further separated the two styles. Despite this
separation, <font color="#191970">hard rock and heavy metal </font>have
co-existed, with bands often straddling or crossing the boundaries
between the two genres.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By the end of the decade, a distinct
hard rock genre was emerging, with bands such as Led Zeppelin, who
with their first two albums Led Zeppelin (<font color="#a9a9a9">1969</font>)
and Led <font color="#dcdcdc">Zeppelin II </font>(1969) mixed the
music of earlier rock bands with a harder form of blues rock and acid
rock, and <font color="#2f4f4f">Deep Purple, </font>who started as a
progressive rock band but achieved their commercial breakthrough with
their fourth and much heavier album <font color="#556b2f">In Rock
</font>(1970). Also notable was <font color="#6b8e23">Black </font>Sabbath's
<font color="#a0522d">Paranoid </font>(<font color="#228b22">1970</font>),
which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit
references to <font color="#191970">the occult and elements of Gothic
horror</font>. All three of these bands have been seen as key figures
in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further emphasised
the intensity of the music, and bands like <font color="#8b0000">Judas
Priest </font>followed Sabbath's lead into territory that was often
'darker and more menacing', hard rock remained a more exuberant and
fun music.</p>

of <font color="#a9a9a9">disco in the US and </font><font color="#dcdcdc">punk
rock in the </font><font color="#a9a9a9">UK</font>, hard rock's
mainstream dominance changed towards the end of the decade. Disco
appealed to a more diverse group of people, and punk seemed to take
over hard rock's rebellious role. Early punk bands like <font color="#2f4f4f">The
Ramones were </font>clearly rebelling <font color="#556b2f">against
</font>the <font color="#556b2f">drum solos and long guitar solos
</font>typical of stadium rock, and almost all their songs were
around two minutes long without guitar solos. However, new rock bands
continued to emerge and record sales remained high throughout the
1980s. In 1977, Foreigner debuted and rose to stardom, releasing
several platinum albums until the mid-1980s. Midwestern bands like
<font color="#6b8e23">Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx </font>helped
establish heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock<font color="#6b8e23">.
In 1978, </font><font color="#a0522d">Van Halen </font>emerged from
the <font color="#228b22">Los Angeles </font>music scene with a sound
based on the skills of guitarist <font color="#191970">Eddie Van
Halen</font>. He popularised a two-handed strum-and-drag guitar
technique called tapping, which was showcased on the Van Halen album
track <font color="#8b0000">&quot;</font><font color="#483d8b">Eruption</font><font color="#8b0000">&quot;.
This technique </font>contributed greatly to the re-establishment of
hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion,
while redefining and emphasising the role of the electric guitar.</p>

</font>more than any previous or subsequent album by Coverdale or
Deep Purple. It featured the rock anthem &quot;Here I Go Again '87&quot;,
which was one of four UK top 20 singles. The follow-up Slip of the
Tongue (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine
and Greg Prato, &quot;<font color="#556b2f">it was a major
disappointment </font>after the resounding success of Whitesnake&quot;.
Aerosmith's comeback album <font color="#6b8e23">Permanent Vacation
</font>(1987) would begin a decade-long resurgence in their
popularity. Kiss' Crazy Nights (1987) was the band's highest charting
album in the US since 1979 and their career high in the UK. Mötley
Crüe continued their commercial success with <font color="#a0522d">Girls,
Girls, Girls </font>(1987) and Def Leppard reached their commercial
peak with Hysteria (1987), which produced <font color="#228b22">seven
</font>hit singles (a record for a hard rock band). Guns N' Roses
released their best-selling debut album of all time, <font color="#191970">Appetite
for Destruction </font>(1987). It had a &quot;grittier&quot; and
&quot;rawer&quot; sound than most glam metal albums and produced
three top 10 hits, including the number one hit <font color="#8b0000">&quot;Sweet
Child O' Mine&quot;.</font> Some of the glam rock bands formed in the
mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella, experienced their
greatest success during this period, with their albums Pride (1987)
and Long Cold Winter (1988) both achieving multi-platinum status and
launching a series of hit singles. In the final years of the decade,
Bon Jovi's New Jersey (1988), Van Halen's OU812 (1988), Open Up and
Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump (1989) by Aerosmith and Mötley
Crüe's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New
Jersey produced five Top 10 singles, a record for a hard rock band.
In 1988, between 25 June and 5 November, the number one spot on the
Billboard 200 album chart was held by <font color="#483d8b">a hard
rock album for </font>18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were
OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction and New Jersey. The last
wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s and experienced
success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until
the early 1990s, including Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse.
Skid Row also released their self-titled debut (1989), which reached
number six on the Billboard 200 chart, but remained one of the last
great bands to emerge from the glam rock era.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">A few hard rock bands of the 1970s
and 1980s managed to maintain a very successful recording career. Bon
Jovi still managed to achieve a commercial hit with their double
platinum album Crush (2000), and <font color="#dcdcdc">AC/DC </font>released
the platinum Stiff Upper Lip (<font color="#2f4f4f">2000)</font>;
Aerosmith released the platinum album Just Push Play (2001), which
took the band further into the pop side with the Top 10 hit &quot;Jaded&quot;;
and the blues cover album Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five
in 2004. Heart achieved its first Top 10 album since the early 90s
<font color="#556b2f">with Red Velvet Car in </font>2010, becoming
the first female-led hard rock band to achieve Top 10 albums in five
decades. The reunions and tours of Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and
Roth in 2007), The Who (the death of bassist <font color="#6b8e23">John
Entwistle </font>delayed the band from 2002 to 2006) and Black
Sabbath (with Osbourne from 1997 to 2006 and Dio from 2006 to 2010),
as well as a one-off appearance by Led Zeppelin (2007), rekindled
interest in earlier eras. In addition, hard rock supergroups such as
<font color="#a0522d">Audioslave </font>(featuring former members of
Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver
(featuring former members of Guns N' Roses, members of punk band
Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer <font color="#228b22">Scott
Weiland</font>) were formed and experienced some success. However,
these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008. The
long-awaited Guns N' Roses album <font color="#191970">Chinese
Democracy </font>was finally released in 2008, but it only went
platinum and did not come close to the success of the band's material
from the late 1980s and early 1990s. AC/DC released the more
successful double-platinum album Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued
their success, branching out into country music with 'Who Says You
Can't Go Home', which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles
chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached
number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released another number one
album, The Circle, which marked a return to the hard rock sound.</p>

third of </font>their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand
square miles (several hundred thousand square kilometres) of the
Great Plains are home to fewer than 6 people per square mile (2.3
people per square kilometre) - the density standard used by <font color="#2f4f4f">Frederick
Jackson Turner </font>when he declared the American frontier &quot;closed&quot;
in <font color="#556b2f">1893.</font> Many areas have less than 2

In the state of Kansas alone, there are <font color="#6b8e23">more
than </font>6<font color="#a0522d">,000 </font>ghost towns, according
to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald. This problem is often
compounded by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of
attracting modern industry to the area. In addition, a declining
school-age population has forced the consolidation of school
districts and the closure of high schools in some communities.
Continued population loss has led some to suggest that the current
use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable, and a
proposal has been put forward - the &quot;Buffalo Commons&quot; - to
return some <font color="#228b22">139,000 square miles </font>(360,000

</font>opened up the Great Plains to settlement, as it was now
possible to <font color="#dcdcdc">transport wheat and other crops
</font>cheaply to urban markets in the East and Europe. American
settlers were given free homestead land. Railroads sold land cheaply
<font color="#2f4f4f">to immigrants in the </font>expectation that
they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established.
Immigrants flooded in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. They
clearly realised that they needed a hard-working wife and numerous
children to take care of the many chores, such as bringing up the
children, feeding and clothing the family, doing the housework,
feeding the paid workers and, especially after the <font color="#556b2f">1930s,
</font>taking care of the paperwork and financial details. In the
early years of settlement, farmers played a key role in ensuring the
family's survival by working outside. After a generation or so, women
increasingly left the fields, redefining their role in the family.
New technologies, such as <font color="#6b8e23">sewing and washing
machines, </font>encouraged women to take on domestic tasks. The
media and government extension agents promoted the scientific
domestic movement throughout the country. There were also district
fairs to showcase achievements in home cooking and canning, advice
columns for women on farm accounting and home economics courses in
schools.</p>

Meadows provided a new niche for <font color="#6b8e23">mammals</font>,

been a strong correlation between the proliferation of grasslands and
the <font color="#228b22">development of grazers</font>. However,
examination of mammalian teeth suggests that changes in mammalian
diet are associated with open, rough habitat rather than the grass
itself, giving rise to the &quot;rough, not grass&quot; hypothesis.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">To enable the development of
agriculture on the Great Plains and the settlement of a growing
population, the United States passed the Homestead Acts of1862 : it
allowed a settler to claim <font color="#dcdcdc">up to 160 acres </font>(65
ha) of land, provided he lived on it <font color="#2f4f4f">for five
years </font>and farmed it. The provisions were extended by the
Kinkaid Act of 19981904 to cover an entire section of homestead.
<font color="#6b8e23">Hundreds of thousands of </font>people applied
for such <font color="#6b8e23">homesteads</font>, and sometimes built
sod houses on the grass of their land. Many of them were not skilled
dryland farmers, and failures were common. Much of the plains were
settled in relatively wet years. Government experts did not
understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice
that was contrary to what would have worked. Germans from Russia, who
had previously farmed in similar conditions in what is now Ukraine,
fared slightly better than other farm owners. The Dominion Lands Act
of 1871 was a similar law for establishing homesteads on the Canadian
prairies.</p>
