eight years before Turner Classic Movies was founded, Ted Turner
bought the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio for <font color="#dcdcdc">$1.5

Turner to sell the studio back in October <font color="#2f4f4f">to

than a year earlier. As part of the deal, Turner Entertainment
retained ownership of MGM's film library, which had been released

largely on films <font color="#556b2f">released </font>before 1970
and broadcast them uncut, uncoloured and without commercials. By
<font color="#6b8e23">2002, </font>AMC had expanded its film content

essentially as an ad-free service, with the only ads online being
shown between features promoting TCM products, ads for upcoming
specials, and original trailers for films shown on TCM (especially
trailers for films broadcast in prime time), as well as featurettes
on the actors and actresses of classic films. In addition, longer
breaks between <font color="#a9a9a9">films </font>will be filled with
theatrical release trailers and classic shorts - for example from The
Passing Parade, Crime Does Not Pay, Pete Smith Specialties and <font color="#dcdcdc">Robert

Reel Wonders). </font>In 2007, some of the short films shown on TCM
were made available as a streaming service on the TCM website. Partly
to accommodate these interludes, Turner Classic Movies schedules its
feature films either <font color="#6b8e23">at the beginning of the

</font>1994, TCM introduced &quot;TCM Remembers&quot;, a tribute to
recently deceased film personalities (such as actors, producers,
composers, directors, writers and cinematographers), which is
sometimes shown during commercial breaks between films. There are two
sets of clips: individual memories and a longer <font color="#dcdcdc">compilation
of the rest of the year</font>. When a particularly famous classic
film personality (usually an actor, producer, filmmaker or director)
has died recently, the episode shows a compilation of images taken
from the deceased's work. Every <font color="#2f4f4f">December, a
</font>longer and more comprehensive &quot;TCM Remembers&quot;
episode is produced to pay tribute to all the famous film
personalities who have died during the past year. The episodes
include scenes from an abandoned drive-in restaurant (2012) or a
theatre being closed down and demolished (2013). Since 2001, the
soundtracks for these clips have been introspective melodies from

theory of gunas (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche). According to
it, there are three types of gunas: <font color="#dcdcdc">sattva </font>is
good, compassionate, enlightening, positive and constructive; <font color="#2f4f4f">rajas
</font>guna is activity, chaotic, passionate, impulsive, potentially
good or bad; and <font color="#556b2f">tamas </font>is the quality of
darkness, ignorance, destructive, sluggish, negative. In everything,
in all forms of life and in all human beings, Samkhya scholars say,
there are these <font color="#6b8e23">three gunas, </font>but in
different proportions. The interaction of these gunas determines the
<font color="#a0522d">nature of someone or something</font>, its
nature, and determines the course of life. Samkhya theorises the
plurality of conscious souls (Jeevatmas) but <font color="#228b22">denies
the existence of Ishvara (God). </font>Classical Samkhya is

other things, the name of one of the six <font color="#a9a9a9">philosophical
schools of</font> āstika. The philosophical system of yoga is
closely related to the dualistic premises of the Samkhya school. The
Yoga school accepts <font color="#2f4f4f">the psychology and

<font color="#191970">pratyakṣa </font>(perception), anumāṇa

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Vaiśeṣika philosophy is a
naturalistic school; it is a form of atomism in natural philosophy.
It proposed that all objects in the physical universe are reducible
to paramāṇu (<font color="#dcdcdc">atoms), </font>and human
experience is derived from the interplay of substance (which is a
function of atoms, their number and spatial order), quality,
activity, cohesion, particularity and inherence. According to the
Vaiśeṣika school, knowledge and liberation were attainable <font color="#2f4f4f">through
a complete understanding of the </font><font color="#556b2f">world of
experience. The </font>Vaiśeṣika darśana is considered to have
belonged to <font color="#6b8e23">Kaṇāda Kaśyapa </font>from the
second half of the <font color="#a0522d">first millennium BC </font>onwards.

Vaiśeṣika are based on a kind of atomism, according to which
reality consists of <font color="#a9a9a9">four </font>substances
(<font color="#dcdcdc">earth, water, air, fire</font>). Each of these
four is of two types: atomic (paramāṇu) and <font color="#2f4f4f">composite</font>.
According to Vaiśeṣika scholars, the <font color="#556b2f">atom is
that which </font>is indestructible (anitya), indivisible and has a
special dimension called 'small' (<font color="#6b8e23">aṇu).
</font><font color="#a0522d">Composite is </font>defined in this

composite, while atoms are <font color="#8b0000">invisible</font>.
The Vaiśeṣis stated that size, shape, truths and all that man
experiences as a whole depends on atoms, their number and spatial
arrangement, their guṇa (quality), karma (function), sāmānya
(commonality), viśeṣa (particularity) and amavāya (heredity, the

sub-school of Vedanta and represents spiritual and universal
non-dualism. Its metaphysics is a kind of absolute monism, i.e. all
ultimate reality is an interconnected unity. This is the oldest and
most widely recognised school of Vedantism. The fundamental texts of
this school are the Brahma Sutras and the early Upanishads, dating
from the 1st millennium BC onwards. Its first great exponent was the
800th century scholar <font color="#dcdcdc">Adi Shankara</font>, who
continued the line of thought of the Upanishad teachers and his

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to this school of Vedanta,
all reality is <font color="#a9a9a9">Brahman, and there </font>is
nothing that is not Brahman. Its metaphysics includes the concepts of
<font color="#dcdcdc">māyā and ātman</font>. <font color="#2f4f4f">Māyā
</font>means 'that which exists but is constantly changing and is
therefore mentally unreal'. <font color="#556b2f">Empirical reality
</font>is considered to be <font color="#6b8e23">ever-changing </font>and
therefore 'transient, imperfect, illusory and not what it appears to
be'. ātman's concept is the <font color="#a0522d">soul</font>, the
self in every human being, every living being. Advaita Vedantins
maintain that ātman is the <font color="#228b22">same as </font><font color="#191970">Brahman,
</font>and this <font color="#8b0000">Brahman </font>is within every
human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually
interconnected, and there is oneness in all existence. According to
them, dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as a spiritual reality
that has meaning are due to ignorance and are the cause of sorrow and
suffering. <font color="#483d8b">Jīvanmukti </font>(liberation in
life) can be achieved through self-knowledge, realising that ātman
within is the same as ātman in another person and the whole of
Brahman - the eternal, unchanging, cosmic totality of principles and

decentralised in the US due to the separation of powers, federalism

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The United States has become
essentially <font color="#a9a9a9">a two-party system</font>. Because
the conservative (like the Republican Party) and liberal (like the
Democratic Party) parties have tended to dominate American politics.
The first parties were called the <font color="#dcdcdc">Federalists
and the Republicans</font>, after which the Republican dominance was
dominant for a short time before a split between the National
Republicans and the Democratic Republicans occurred. The former
became the Whig Party and the latter the Democratic Party. The Whigs
survived for only <font color="#2f4f4f">two decades </font>before
splitting over the <font color="#556b2f">spread of slavery</font>,
and anti-slavery members joined the new Republican Party, as did
anti-slavery members of the <font color="#6b8e23">Democratic Party.</font>
Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often have little
support and very rarely win elections. Nevertheless, there have been
several examples of third parties <font color="#a0522d">taking votes
away from </font>major parties that were expected to win (such as
Theodore Roosevelt in the <font color="#228b22">1912 </font>election
and George Wallace in the 1968 election). As the third party movement
has learned, the Electoral College's requirement for a nationally
divided majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed.
Consequently, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although
their support in the state may tilt toward the party. Wallace's
<font color="#191970">support was weak </font>outside the South. In
general, parties with broad support in different regions or among
economic and other interest groups have a good chance of winning the
necessary majority in the United States, where the winner takes all
the votes and the constituency is largely single-member. The
<font color="#8b0000">country's vast surface area and large

formed. These coalitions have been led exclusively by either Fianna
Fáil or Fine Gael. <font color="#191970">Political change is often
easier in a coalition government </font>than in a system dominated by
one or two parties.[dubious - discuss] If factions in a two-party
system fundamentally disagree on policy objectives or even
principles, they can be slow to make political changes, which seems
to be the case now in the United States, where power is divided
between Democrats and Republicans. Coalition governments sometimes
struggle for years to change policy and often fail completely, as in
<font color="#8b0000">post-World War II </font><font color="#483d8b">France
and Italy.</font> However, in a two-party system, when one party
controls all electoral authorities, policy changes can be rapid and
significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon
Johnson benefited from such fortuitous circumstances, as did
Republicans as far back in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.
Barack Obama had such an advantage briefly between 2009 and 2011.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">The polyphony
of Christian a cappella music </font><font color="#dcdcdc">began to
develop in Europe in </font>the late 15th century with the
compositions of <font color="#2f4f4f">Josquin des Prez</font>. Early
a cappella polyphony may have included an accompaniment instrument,
although this instrument only doubled the singers' parts and was not
independent. By the 16th century a cappella polyphony had developed
further, but gradually the <font color="#556b2f">cantata </font>began
to supplant the a cappella forms. However, the a cappella polyphony
of the 16th century continued to influence church composers
throughout this period and up to the present day. Recent evidence has
shown that some of Palestrina's early works, such as those written
for the Sistine Chapel, were intended to <font color="#6b8e23">be
accompanied </font><font color="#a0522d">by </font>an<font color="#a0522d">
organ that </font><font color="#6b8e23">'doubled' some or all of the
voices. </font>Such was seen in the life of <font color="#228b22">Palestrina</font>,
which became a major influence on <font color="#191970">Bach</font>,
particularly in the <font color="#8b0000">Mass in B minor</font>
mentioned above. Other composers who made use of the a cappella
style, albeit only in the occasional piece, were Claudio Monteverdi
and his masterpiece Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (Tears of
a lover on the grave of his beloved), composed in <font color="#483d8b">1610,
</font>and <font color="#3cb371">Andrea Gabrieli</font>, when several
choral pieces were discovered after his death, one of which was
unaccompanied. Following the teachings of the two previous composers,
Heinrich Schütz used the a cappella style in a number of pieces, the
most important of which were the <font color="#bc8f8f">oratorio-style
</font>pieces traditionally performed during Easter week, dealing
with the religious themes of that week, such as the Passion and
Passion of Christ. Five of Schutz's Historien works were Easter
pieces, and the latter <font color="#663399">three, which </font>dealt
with the Passion from three different perspectives, from Matthew,
Luke and John, were all performed a cappella. This was almost a
requirement for this type of work, and the crowd parts were sung,
while the solo parts, which were passages borrowed either from Christ
or from the authors, were performed in plain language.</p>

the Temple in Jerusalem </font>included <font color="#dcdcdc">musical
instruments </font>(2 Chronicles 29:25-27), traditional Jewish
services in the synagogue did not include <font color="#2f4f4f">musical
instruments </font>before and after the final destruction of the
temple, because they used the singing of the sacred scriptures on the
canticles. The <font color="#556b2f">use of musical instruments </font>is
traditionally prohibited <font color="#6b8e23">on the Sabbath for
</font>fear that the players would be tempted to repair (or tune)
their instruments, which is forbidden on those days (this prohibition
has been relaxed in many Reform congregations and some Conservative
congregations). When Jewish families and larger groups sing
traditional Shabbat songs, known as zemirot, <font color="#a0522d">outside

a semi-mourning period</font>, and <font color="#bc8f8f">instrumental

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">It is unclear where collegiate a
cappella began. Founded in 1873, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
Rensselyrics (formerly known as the <font color="#a9a9a9">RPI Glee
Club</font>) is perhaps the oldest known college a cappella group.
However, the longest continuously singing ensemble is probably the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, </font>formed
in 1909 and once featuring <font color="#2f4f4f">Cole Porter.
</font>Collegiate a cappella groups continued to grow <font color="#556b2f">throughout
the 20th century</font>. Notable historical groups formed along the
way include the Princeton University Tigertones (1946), The Colgate
13 (1942), Dartmouth College Aires (1946), Cornell University Cayugan
Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), University of Maine Maine
Steiners (1958), Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), Brown
University Jabberwocks (1949) and University of Rochester
YellowJackets (1956). Women's a cappella groups, often as parodies of
<font color="#6b8e23">male ensembles, </font>soon followed: the
<font color="#a0522d">Smiffenpoofs of Smith College </font>(1936),
The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944) and
The Chattertocks of Brown University (1951). The popularity of a
cappella groups exploded <font color="#228b22">from the 1990s
onwards</font>, partly due to the change in style favoured by the
Beelzebubs at Tufts University and Dear Abbey at Boston University.
The new style used sounds to imitate modern rock instruments,
including vocal sounds/&quot;beatboxing&quot;. Some larger
universities now have several groups. Groups often join together for
on-campus concerts, such as the <font color="#191970">Georgetown
Chimes' Cherry Tree Massacre</font>, a three-weekend a cappella
festival that has been held every February since 1975 and has
featured more than 100 college groups, the International Quartet
Champions on The Boston Common, and the modern commercial a cappella
ensemble Rockapella. The Common Groups have produced many emerging
and notable artists, including <font color="#8b0000">John Legend</font>,
an alumnus of Counterparts at the University of Pennsylvania, and
Sara Bareilles, an alumnus of Awaken A Cappella at the University of
California, Los Angeles. Mira Sorvino is an alumna of Harvard

instruments </font>by playing the instrument sounds with their vocal
cords and mouth. One of the earliest practitioners of this method in
the 20th century was <font color="#dcdcdc">The Mills Brothers</font>,
whose first recordings in the 1930s clearly stated on the label that
all instrumentation was done by singing. More recently, the 2
Unlimited song &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; was sung with a cappella
instrumentation in the sitcom <font color="#2f4f4f">Tompkins Square.
</font>Another famous example of imitating instrumentation instead of
singing the words is the <font color="#556b2f">theme song for the </font>Fox
Family Channel (now ABC Family) <font color="#556b2f">series </font><font color="#6b8e23">The
New Addams Family. </font>Groups such as <font color="#a0522d">Vocal
Sampling and Undivided </font>emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In
the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate
instruments <font color="#228b22">in baroque and classical music.
</font>Vocal artist Bobby McFerrin is famous for <font color="#191970">emulating

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Dominican Order was born in the
Middle Ages, at a time when <font color="#a9a9a9">religion was being
looked at in a new way</font>. <font color="#dcdcdc">Men </font>of<font color="#dcdcdc">
God </font>were no longer expected to remain <font color="#2f4f4f">behind
the walls of the monastery.</font> Instead, they walked among the
people, taking as their models the apostles of the early Church. From
this ideal emerged <font color="#556b2f">two </font>orders of beggar
brothers: one, the Friars Minor, led by <font color="#6b8e23">Francis
of Assisi, </font>and the other, the <font color="#a0522d">Friars
Preachers</font>, led by <font color="#228b22">Dominicus of Guzman.
</font>Like his contemporary Francis, Dominicus saw the need for a
new form of organisation, and the rapid growth of the <font color="#191970">Dominicans
and Franciscans </font>during their first century confirms that the
orders of the beggar brothers met the need.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Dominic sought to <font color="#a9a9a9">establish
a new kind of order, which would bring the dedication and systematic
training of older monastic orders </font>like the <font color="#dcdcdc">Benedictines
to the </font>religious problems of the growing urban population, but
which would be more organisationally flexible than monastic orders or
secular clergy. Dominic's new order was to become <font color="#2f4f4f">a

the vernacular. </font>Instead of <font color="#6b8e23">earning a

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Dominic inspired his followers <font color="#a9a9a9">with

of the spiritual power of secular deprivation and the religious
state, and his <font color="#dcdcdc">highly developed </font>administrative
structure. At the same time, <font color="#2f4f4f">Dominic </font>inspired
the members of his Rule to develop a <font color="#556b2f">&quot;mixed&quot;
spirituality</font>. They were both active in their preaching and
contemplative in their study, prayer and meditation. In their
spirituality, <font color="#6b8e23">the Dominican </font>friars were
urbane and learned, contemplative and mystical. Although these traits
also influenced the women of the Order, <font color="#a0522d">the
nuns </font>absorbed the latter traits in particular and made them

Dominic and his companions to live in <font color="#2f4f4f">the

in early 1220. Prior to that, the Order had only a temporary
residence in Rome in the monastery of San Sisto Vecchio, which had
been given to Dominicus by Honorius III around 1218 with the
intention of turning it, under Dominicus' direction, into a monastery
for the reforming nuns of Rome. In May 1220 in Bologna, the first
General Chapter of the Order decreed that each new convent had to
have <font color="#556b2f">its own studium conventuale</font>, thus
laying the foundations for the Dominican tradition of supporting
widespread educational institutions. The official foundation of the
Dominican monastery of Santa Sabina and its studium conventuale took
place when Honorius III legally transferred the property to the Order
of Friars Minor on <font color="#6b8e23">5 June 1222</font>. St
Thomas Aquinas transformed this studium into the first studium
provinciale of the Order in 1265. Part of the curriculum of this
studium was transferred in 1288 to the studium of Santa Maria sopra
Minerva, which in the 16th century became the Collegium Divi Thomæ.
In the 20th century the college was transferred to the monastery of
Saints Dominic and Sixtus and became the <font color="#a0522d">Pontifical

the province of Lyon, called Oxitania (1862), the province of
Toulouse (1869) and the province of Canada (1909) were separated. The
French Restoration also sent many workers to the other provinces to
help them organise and progress. It was Père Vincent Jandel
(1850-1872), who remained at the head of the administration for the
longest period of the 19th century. The Province of St Joseph in the
United States should be mentioned in this context. Founded in 1805 by
Edward Fenwick, later the first Bishop of Cincinnati, Ohio
(1821-1832), this province has developed slowly but is now one of the
most prosperous and active provinces of the Order. In 1910 it
included seventeen monasteries or convents. In 1905, it founded a
large house of learning in Washington, the Dominican House of
Learning. Today there are four Dominican provinces in the United
States.</p>

There is a recurring motif in <font color="#6b8e23">the scriptural

hence the commandment forbidding <font color="#a0522d">the making of
images of God </font>(Exodus 20.4-5). Over time, <font color="#228b22">Jewish
and early Christian </font><font color="#191970">writings </font>introduced
the idea of an 'unknown' in which the presence of God was shrouded in
a dark cloud. These images emerged from a bewildering array of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">English Dominican mysticism in the
late Middle Ages differed from its European counterparts in that
while European Dominican mysticism tended to focus on <font color="#a9a9a9">ecstatic
experiences of communion with the divine</font>, the ultimate focus
of <font color="#dcdcdc">English Dominican </font>mysticism was on
the <font color="#2f4f4f">crucial dynamic of </font><font color="#556b2f">a
personal relationship with God</font>. This was the essential moral
imitation of the Saviour as an ideal of religious transformation and
<font color="#6b8e23">as a means of renewing the nature of humanity
</font>in the image of the divine. There were <font color="#a0522d">four
</font>elements to this type of mysticism. First, spiritually, <font color="#228b22">it
imitated the moral essence of the life of Christ</font>. Second,
there was a link between the moral imitation of the life of Christ
and the attitude of humanity as images of divinity. Third, English
Dominican mysticism focused on an embodied spirituality centred on a
structured love of neighbour. Finally, the <font color="#191970">supreme
aspiration of this mysticism </font>was either an ethical or a real
union with God.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Around <font color="#a9a9a9">20% of
</font>Eton students receive financial support through various
scholarships and bursaries<font color="#a9a9a9">. </font>The latest
headteacher, <font color="#dcdcdc">Tony Little, </font>said Eton was
currently developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school
regardless of parental income, and in 2011 he said around 250 boys
received &quot;significant&quot; financial help from the school. By
early 2014, the figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving support
equivalent to around 60% of school fees, with a further <font color="#2f4f4f">63
pupils receiving </font>free education. Mr Little said that in the
short term he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils received
scholarships each year and 70 pupils received free tuition, with the
number of pupils receiving financial assistance set to increase
further. These relatively new developments are in parallel with the
long-standing courses that Eton has been offering to pupils in state
schools, most of which take place during the summer holidays (July
and August). The Universities Summer School, launched in 1982, is an
intensive course open to boys and girls from all over the UK who are
attending state schools, are in Year 6 at the end of their first year
and are about to start their final year of school. Launched in 1994,
the Brent-Eton Summer School offers <font color="#556b2f">40-50 </font>young
people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city
poverty, a free week-long intensive course designed to help bridge
the gap between GCSE and A-levels. In 2008, Eton helped set up the
Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School
Partnership (ISSP) with six local state schools. The ISSP aims to
&quot;<font color="#6b8e23">raise student achievement, improve
student self-esteem, raise student aspirations and improve

students were known as <font color="#a9a9a9">oppidans</font>, from
the Latin word <font color="#dcdcdc">oppidum</font>, meaning city.

organised on a school basis, most boys spent much of their time in
their own house. Each house has an official name, used mainly for the
post office and people outside the Eton community. The boys usually

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Until 18 December <font color="#a9a9a9">2010,
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">Eton College </font>was an exempt
charity under English law (Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2). Under the
provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an exempt charity,
fully registered with the Charities Commission and now one of the top
100 charities in the UK. As a charity, it benefits from <font color="#2f4f4f">substantial
tax relief</font>. The late David Jewell, former headmaster of
Haileybury, calculated that in 1992 such tax relief saved the school
around <font color="#6b8e23">£1,945 per pupil per year, </font>even
though he had no direct connection with the school. This support has
declined since the Labour government in 2001 abolished state-funded
bursaries (formerly known as 'assisted places') for independent
schools. However, no children attended Eton under this scheme, so the
actual level of state support for the school has always been lower.
Tony Little, the retiring headmaster of Eton, has argued that the
benefits (<font color="#a0522d">use of school facilities</font>,
etc.) that Eton provides to the local community free of charge are
worth more than the tax relief the school receives because of its
charitable status. For the 2010-2011 academic year, the fee was <font color="#228b22">£29
862 </font><font color="#191970">(about </font><font color="#8b0000">US$48

4.5 hectares of land <font color="#a0522d">in exchange for exclusive

grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the school's
treasurer argued that the Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was
being &quot;exploited&quot; because local people (who were not
students of the College) did not have a world-class running track and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 2005, the Office of Fair Trading
found that fifty independent schools, including Etoile, had breached
competition law by &quot;regularly and systematically&quot;
exchanging information on planned increases in school fees, which had
been collated and distributed to schools by the Sevenoaks School
governor. Following an OFT investigation, each school was ordered to
pay around <font color="#dcdcdc">£70,000</font><font color="#2f4f4f">,
or a total of around £3.5 million</font>, which is significantly
less than the maximum fine. The schools also agreed to jointly
contribute a further £3 million <font color="#556b2f">to a new
charitable education fund</font>. The case raised concerns about
whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton
should be reconsidered and perhaps withdrawn. However, <font color="#6b8e23">Jean
Scott, </font>director of the Independent Schools Council, said that
independent schools had always been exempt from the anti-trust rules
applicable to businesses, had long followed a well-established
procedure for sharing information with each other and were unaware of
the change in the law (which they had not been consulted about). He
wrote to John Vickers, Director General of the OFT, saying: &quot;They
are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the
prices of their products to the detriment of consumers. They are
schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-standing
practice because they did not know that the law had changed.&quot;</p>

Mallow. The N22 Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass linking Cork to
the western end of the southern ring road was opened in September
2004. Road improvements in the city centre include the Patrick Street
project, which redesigned the street <font color="#3cb371">to be

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The area now known as Galicia was
first inhabited in <font color="#a9a9a9">the Middle Palaeolithic
</font>period, and takes its name from <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Gallaecil, a Celtic people who </font>lived north of the Douro River
in the last millennium BC in an area largely parallel to the local
Castro culture of the Iron Age. Galicia was annexed <font color="#2f4f4f">to
the Roman Empire in </font>19 BC at the end of the Cantabrian Wars
and became a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the
Germanic Suebi founded an empire with its capital in Braga
(Portugal), which was incorporated into the Visigothic Empire in 585.
In 711 the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula and conquered the
Visigothic kingdom, but soon afterwards in 740 Galicia was annexed to
the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the
Kingdom of Galicia was ruled at times by its own kings, but for the
most part it was linked to the Kingdom of Leon and later the Kingdom
of Castile, while retaining its own legal and customary practices and
personality. From the 13th century, the kings of Castile appointed
Adiantado Mór as King of Galicia, whose functions were transferred
from the last century to the Governor and Captain General of the
Kingdom of Galicia. The Governor also headed the Real Audiencia do
Reino de Galicia, the judicial and administrative body. From the 16th
century onwards, the kingdom was represented and voted for by an
assembly of representatives and deputies from the cities of the
kingdom, the <font color="#556b2f">Cortes or Junta of </font>the
Kingdom of Galicia<font color="#556b2f">, which was </font>forcibly
abolished in 1833, when the kingdom was divided into four
administrative provinces with no legal links between them. The 19th
and 20th centuries saw a growing demand for self-government and
recognition of Galicia's personality, leading to the frustrated 1936
Statute of Self-Government and the <font color="#6b8e23">1981 </font>Statute

by a hilly landscape, although in the east and south the mountains
rise <font color="#a9a9a9">to 2 000 metres.</font> The coastal areas
are mostly alternating rías (underwater valleys where the sea
penetrates tens of kilometres inland) and cliffs. Galicia's climate
is temperate and rainy, but also much drier in summer. In the west
and north, the climate is generally classified as oceanic, and in the
south-east as Mediterranean. Due to topographical and climatic
conditions, <font color="#dcdcdc">livestock farming and agriculture
have been the </font>main source of wealth in Galicia for most of its
history. With the exception of shipbuilding and food processing,
Galicia was largely semi-subsistence and did not experience
significant industrialisation until the mid-20th century. In 2012,
GDP in purchasing power parity was €56 000 million, and nominal GDP
per capita was €20 700. The population is largely concentrated in
two coastal areas: <font color="#2f4f4f">from Ferrol to A Coruña in
the </font>north-west and from Pontevedra to Vigo in the south-west.
To a lesser extent, the population is also concentrated in the inland
towns of Lugo, Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. The political
capital is <font color="#556b2f">Santiago de Compostela </font>in the
province of <font color="#6b8e23">A Coruña</font>. Vigo, in the

Ages from Gallaecia, sometimes spelled <font color="#a9a9a9">Galletia,
to </font>Gallicia. With the literary development of the Galician

during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. Thousands of
megalithic mounds are located throughout the country, but mostly in
coastal areas. Inside each mound is a stone burial chamber, known
locally as an anta (dolmen), often preceded by a corridor. Later
Galicia was fully influenced by the Bell Beaker culture. Its rich

the development of Bronze Age metallurgy and trade in bronze and gold

Geographically, it corresponds to the Roman Gallaeci people, which
consisted of a large number of peoples or tribes, including the
Artabri, Bracari, Limici, Celtici, Albiones and Lemavi. They were
skilled fighters: Strabo described them as the most difficult enemies
the Romans encountered in their conquest of Lusitania, and <font color="#2f4f4f">Appianus
</font>mentions their warlike spirit, noting that women carried their
weapons alongside men and often preferred to die rather than be

taming of Galicia, for not only the local lords and knights, but the

(<font color="#556b2f">Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) </font>and
subjugated the nobility, but at the same time brought most Galician
monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, which has been
criticised as a process of centralisation. At the same time, the
kings began to convene the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia,
an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the
kingdom, to request financial and military aid. This assembly soon
became the voice and legal representation of the kingdom and the

Galician privateers attacked coastal areas, but large-scale raids
were not common because the coastline was difficult and the ports
easily defensible. The most famous attacks were those of Sir Francis
Drake on the town of <font color="#a9a9a9">Vigo in </font>1585 and

economic exhaustion in Castile. The junta of the Kingdom of Galicia
(the local Cortes or Assembly) initially responded favourably to

or less the same as ten years ago; the second two (reading and
writing) have both improved enormously: ten years ago only 49.3% of
the population could read Galician and only 34.85% could write it.
This can easily be explained by the fact that during Francisco
Franco's reign the Gallego language could not be taught, so older
people speak the language but have no literacy skills. Among the
regional languages of Spain, Gallego is the most widely spoken
language in the region.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The existence of the early state of

There are mainly a mixture of mythological stories and historical
legends about Shu, recorded in local annals such as the <font color="#556b2f">Huayang
Chronicle of </font>the <font color="#6b8e23">Jin Dynasty (265-420</font>),

who taught the people agriculture and turned himself into <font color="#a0522d">a
cuckoo </font>when he died. The existence of a highly developed
civilisation and an independent bronze industry in Sichuan was
finally revealed by an archaeological discovery made in 1986 in a
small village called Sanxingdui in Guanghan, Sichuan. This site,
believed to be the ancient city of <font color="#228b22">Shu</font>,
was originally discovered <font color="#191970">in 1929 by a local
farmer </font>who found jade and stone artefacts. Excavations by
archaeologists in the area produced few significant finds until 1986,
when two large sacrificial pits were discovered, yielding spectacular
bronze objects, as well as jade, gold, clay and stone objects. These
and other discoveries in Sichuan challenge the traditional
historiography that Sichuan's local culture and technology were
underdeveloped compared to the technologically and culturally
'advanced' <font color="#8b0000">Yellow River Valley of </font>central

is strongly monsoonal, with precipitation concentrated in summer.
According to the Köppen climate classification, the <font color="#dcdcdc">Sichuan

has a <font color="#2f4f4f">humid subtropical climate </font>(Köppen
Cwa or Cfa) with long, hot and humid summers and short, mild to cool,
dry and cloudy winters. As a result, it has the least sunshine in
China. The western region has mountainous areas which produce a
cooler but sunnier climate. They have cool to very cold winters and
mild summers, and temperatures tend to fall with increasing altitude.
However, due to the high altitude and inland location, many areas,
such as <font color="#556b2f">Garze County and Zoige County </font>in
Sichuan, have a <font color="#6b8e23">subarctic climate </font>(Köppen

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Unicode includes a mechanism for
changing the format of characters, which greatly expands the
supported character set. This includes the mapping of <font color="#a9a9a9">diacritical
marks</font>. They are added after the main character. Several
combining diacritics can be stacked on top of the <font color="#dcdcdc">same
character. </font>Unicode also includes pre-compiled versions of <font color="#2f4f4f">most
of the </font>commonly used <font color="#2f4f4f">letter/diacritic
character combinations. </font>These simplify conversion to and from
legacy encodings and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal
text format without having to implement <font color="#556b2f">combining
</font>characters. For example, é can be represented in Unicode as
<font color="#6b8e23">U+0065 </font>(LATIN SMALL LETTER E) followed
by <font color="#a0522d">U+0301 </font>(COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT), but
it can also be represented as the pre-composed character <font color="#228b22">U+00E9
</font>(LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE). Thus, in many cases, users
have several ways to encode the same character. For this purpose,
Unicode provides a <font color="#191970">canonical equivalence

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Due to industrial restructuring and
job losses in the automotive industry, Detroit lost a significant
amount of population from the late 20th century to the present.
Between 2000 and 2010, the city's population declined by <font color="#a9a9a9">25%</font>,
moving it from the 10th largest city in the country to 18th. In 2010,
the city's population was 713,777, down more than 60 percent from the
1950 census peak population of more than 1.8 million. This was due to
suburbanisation, industrial restructuring and the decline of
Detroit's automotive industry. As population and jobs have moved to
the suburbs or to other states or nations, the city has focused on
becoming the employment and economic hub of the metropolitan area.
Downtown Detroit's role as an entertainment destination has grown in
the 2000s with the renovation of several historic theatres, the
construction of several new sports stadiums and the revitalisation of
the riverfront. More recently, the population of downtown Detroit,
Midtown Detroit and several other parts of the city has grown. Many
other parts of the city remain underdeveloped, with large numbers of

link between inequitable housing practices and educational
segregation that resulted in segregated neighborhoods. In its ruling,

segregation. The Sixth Circuit Court upheld part of the decision,

the city by increasing investment in the declining city centre. The

Snyder </font>declared the city in a state of financial emergency,
noting that the city has a $327 million budget deficit and more than
$14 billion in long-term debt. The city has been surviving on monthly
bond money in the state's asset management account and has imposed
mandatory unpaid furloughs for many city employees. These problems,
coupled with underfunded city services such as police and fire, and
ineffective planning by Bing and the City Council, led the State of
Michigan to appoint an emergency manager for Detroit on 14 March
2013. On June 14, 2013, Detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion in debt by
withholding $39.7 million in interest payments while Emergency
Manager Kevyn Orr met with bondholders and other creditors in an
attempt to restructure the city's $18.5 billion debt and avoid
bankruptcy. The City of Detroit filed for <font color="#2f4f4f">Chapter

the pre-Celtic Old European word *(p)lowonida, meaning <font color="#556b2f">'a

given to the section of the River Thames that flows through London;
hence the settlement was named after the Celtic form *Lowonidonjon;
however, this requires a rather serious amendment. The ultimate
difficulty is to reconcile the Latin Londinium form with the modern
Welsh <font color="#6b8e23">Llundain</font>, which should claim the
form *(h)lōndinion (as opposed to *londīnion), derived from the

cannot be used as a basis for reconstructing the original name.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Culture is a
</font>key anthropological concept that defines the meaning of being
human, and encompasses the phenomena that are transmitted in human
communities through social learning. The word is used in a general
sense as a developed ability to classify and represent experiences in
symbols, and to act imaginatively and creatively. This capacity
emerged with the development of behavioural modernity in humans
around <font color="#dcdcdc">50 000 years ago. </font>This ability is
often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species
have shown similar, albeit much less complex, abilities for social
learning. It is also used to describe the complex networks of
socially transmitted practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas
that exist within particular groups of people or cultures, where the
plural form is used. Some aspects of human behaviour, such as
language, social practices such as <font color="#2f4f4f">kinship, sex
and marriage</font>, forms of expression such as art, music, dance,
rituals and religion, and technologies such as cooking, shelter and
clothing, are considered cultural universals that exist in all human
communities. The concept of tangible culture covers the physical
manifestations of culture, such as <font color="#556b2f">technology,
architecture and art</font>, while the intangible elements of
culture, such as principles of social organisation (including
practices of political organisation and social institutions),
<font color="#6b8e23">mythology, philosophy, literature (both written
and oral) and science, </font>constitute the intangible cultural
heritage of a society.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the humanities, one aspect of
culture as a characteristic of an individual has been the extent to
which the individual has reached a certain level of sophistication in
the arts, sciences, education or customs. The level of cultural
sophistication has also sometimes been seen as distinguishing
civilisations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical
perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions,
which distinguish between the high culture of the social elite and
the low culture, popular or folk culture of the lower classes, which
are differentiated by their stratified access to cultural capital. In
common parlance, culture often refers specifically to symbolic signs
used by ethnic groups to visibly distinguish themselves from one
another, such as <font color="#a9a9a9">body modification, clothing or
jewellery</font>.[dubious - discuss] Mass culture refers to the
mass-produced and mass-mediated forms of consumer culture that
emerged in <font color="#dcdcdc">the 20th century. </font>Some
schools of philosophy, such as <font color="#2f4f4f">Marxism </font>and
critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically
<font color="#556b2f">as a tool of the elite to manipulate the lower
classes and create false consciousness; </font>such perspectives are
common in the discipline of cultural studies. More broadly, in the
social sciences, the theoretical perspective of <font color="#6b8e23">cultural
materialism </font>holds that human symbolic culture emerges from the
material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions
for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in
evolved biological capacities.</p>

&quot;He argued that this immaturity is not due to a lack of

to be wise</font>!&quot; To counter Kant, German scholars such as
<font color="#556b2f">Johann Gottfried Herder </font>(1744-1803)
argued that human creativity, which inevitably takes unpredictable

the ways of thinking, ways of acting and material objects that
</font>together shape the way of life of a people. Culture can take
two forms, intangible culture or material culture. Intangible culture
refers to the <font color="#2f4f4f">intangible perceptions that
</font>individuals have of their culture, such as values, belief
systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organisations and
institutions. Tangible culture, on the other hand, is the physical
evidence of a culture, manifested in the objects and architecture it
produces or has produced. The term is usually relevant only <font color="#556b2f">in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Cultural sociology first emerged in
<font color="#a9a9a9">Weimar Germany </font>(1918-1933), where
sociologists such as <font color="#dcdcdc">Alfred Weber </font>used
the term Kultursoziologie (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology
was 'reinvented' in the English-speaking world as a result of the
'cultural turn' of the 1960s, which brought with it structuralist and
postmodern approaches to the social sciences. This type of cultural
sociology can loosely be seen as an approach that combines cultural
analysis and critical theory. Cultural sociologists tend to reject
<font color="#556b2f">scientific methods </font>and instead focus
hermeneutically on words, artefacts and symbols. &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Culture</font>&quot;
has since become an important concept in many areas of sociology,
including solidly scientific fields such as social stratification and
social network analysis. As a result, the field has recently seen a
proliferation of quantitative sociologists. Thus, there is now a
growing number of cultural sociologists who, confusingly, are not
cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstract
postmodernist aspects of cultural sociology and instead seek
theoretical support from the more scientific foundations of social
psychology and cognitive science. &quot;Cultural sociology&quot; is
one of the largest divisions of the American Sociological
Association. The establishment of cultural sociology in the UK means
that cultural sociology is often taught in the UK as a loosely
distinct discipline.</p>

As the field developed, it began to combine political economy,
communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media
theory, film and video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy,
museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or
cultural texts. In this field, researchers often focus on how
particular phenomena relate to <font color="#556b2f">issues of
ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class and/or gender.
</font>cultural studies is interested in the meanings and practices
of everyday life. These practices include the ways in which people in
a particular culture do certain things (such as watching television
or eating out). This field studies the meanings and uses that people
give to different objects and practices. In particular, culture
encompasses those meanings and practices that are independent of
order. Watching television to follow a public perspective on a
historical event should not be considered culture, unless one is
referring to the television medium itself, which may have been
culturally selected. However, schoolchildren who watch television
after school with their friends in order to 'fit in' are certainly
cultural, since there is no justifiable reason for engaging in this
practice. More recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the
world (<font color="#6b8e23">a process called globalisation</font>),
cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyse local and global forms
of resistance to Western hegemony. <font color="#a0522d">globalisation
in </font>this context can be defined as Western civilisation in
other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other cultures,
and is therefore oppressive, exploitative and harmful to most people
in different places.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since the <font color="#a9a9a9">late

slightly different versions of cultural studies. The British version
of cultural studies had its origins in the <font color="#dcdcdc">1950s

Stuart Hall </font>and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural
Studies at the <font color="#556b2f">University of Birmingham.</font>
This contained overtly political, left-wing views and critiques of
popular culture as 'capitalist' mass culture; it adopted some of the
ideas of the Frankfurt School's critique of the 'culture industry'
(i.e. mass culture). This can be seen in the writings and influences
of early British cultural studies scholars: see for example the works
of Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis and Paul Gilroy.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Lindlof and
Taylor </font>write that in the United States &quot;cultural studies
[was] based on a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition&quot;. The
American version of cultural studies initially focused more on
understanding the subjective and appropriative aspects of public
reactions to mass culture and the ways in which mass culture was
used; for example, American cultural studies advocates wrote about
the liberatory aspects of fandom. however, the distinction between
the American and British trends has blurred. some scholars,
particularly early British cultural studies scholars, apply a Marxist
model to the field. This line of thought has been influenced by the
Frankfurt School, but especially by the structuralist Marxism of
Louis Althusser and others. The orthodox Marxist approach focuses on
the production of meaning. This model assumes the mass production of
culture, and power is seen as being in the hands of those who produce
cultural objects. In the Marxist view, those who control the means of
production (the <font color="#dcdcdc">economic base) </font>essentially
control culture. Other approaches to cultural studies, such as
<font color="#2f4f4f">feminist cultural studies </font>and subsequent
American developments in the field, move away from this view. They
criticise the Marxist assumption that there is a single, dominant and
shared meaning for any cultural product. Non-Marxist approaches argue
that different ways of consuming cultural objects affect the meaning
of the product. This view is expressed in Doing Cultural Studies: The
Story of the Sony Walkman (Paul du Gay et al.), which seeks to
challenge the notion that the producers of commodities control the
meanings people give to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist and
<font color="#556b2f">art historian Griselda Pollock </font>contributed
to cultural studies from the perspectives of art history and
psychoanalysis. The writer <font color="#6b8e23">Julia Kristeva </font>is
one of the influential voices of the turn of the century who
contributed to cultural studies from the perspectives of art and
psychoanalytic French feminism[1].</p>

high average temperature was <font color="#8b0000">47°C </font>in
the remote Algerian desert town of Bou Bernous, <font color="#483d8b">378

high temperature in the world, rivalled only by Death Valley in
California. In other hot spots in Algeria, such as Adrar, Timimoun,
In Salah, Ouallen, Aoulef and Reggane, which are between 200 and 400
metres above sea level, average summer temperatures are slightly
lower, around <font color="#3cb371">46°C in the </font>hottest

45.5°C (113.9°F) and 41.9°C (107.4°F) in June, July, August and
September. In fact, there are even hotter places in the Sahara, but
they are located in very remote areas, especially in the Azalea
region in northern Mali. In most parts of the desert, there are about
3-5 months when the average maximum temperature is above 40 °C (104
°F). In the south-central part of the desert, there are up to 6-7
months when the average temperature is strictly above 40 °C (104
°F), indicating the persistence and length of the really hot season
in the Sahara. Examples are Bilma in Niger and Faya-Largeau in Chad.
The annual average daily temperature is above 20°C everywhere, and
in the hottest regions it can approach 30°C all year round. However,
in most parts of the desert the temperature is above <font color="#663399">25
°C </font>(77 °F). Sand and soil temperatures are even more
extreme. During the day, sand temperatures are very high, easily
reaching <font color="#008080">80 °C (176 °F) </font>or more. In
Port Sudan, sand temperatures have been recorded at 83.5 °C (182.3
°F). Surface temperatures of 72 °C (161.6 °F) have been recorded
in Adrar, Mauritania, and 75 °C (167 °F) in Borkou, northern Chad.
Because the desert has no cloud cover and very low humidity, the
desert generally experiences large diurnal temperature variations
between days and nights. However, it is a myth that nights are cold
in the Sahara after very hot days. The average daily temperature
usually ranges between <font color="#bdb76b">13°C </font>and 20°C.
The lowest values are found in coastal areas due to high humidity and
are often as low as 10°C, while the highest values are found in
inland desert areas where humidity is lowest, mainly in the southern
Sahara. Nevertheless, it is true that winter nights can be cold, as
temperatures can drop to freezing and even below, especially in high
altitude areas.</p>

atmospheric disturbances from the north or south, and the annual
average rainfall can fall to <font color="#8b0000">less than 1 mm. </font>In
fact, most of the <font color="#483d8b">Sahara </font>receives less
than 20 mm (0.79 inches) of rain. Of the <font color="#3cb371">9 000
000 square kilometres of desert area in the </font>Sahara, about 2
800 000 square kilometres (about <font color="#bc8f8f">31% of </font>the

about 1 500 000 square kilometres (about <font color="#663399">17% </font>of
the total area) receive an average annual rainfall of 5 mm or less.
The average annual rainfall is close to zero over a large area of
about 1 000 000 km2 in the Eastern Sahara, covering the deserts of
Libya, Egypt and Sudan (Tazirbu, Kufra, Dakhla, Kharga, Farafra,
Siwa, Asyut, Sohag, Luxor, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Wadi Halfa), where the
long-term average is about 0.5 mm per year. In the Sahara, rainfall
is very unreliable and irregular, as it can vary considerably from
year to year. Annual evaporation is very high, ranging from around 2
500 mm per year to over 6 000 mm per year across the desert, which is
in stark contrast to the low annual rainfall. Nowhere else on earth
is the air as dry and evaporative as in the Sahara. With such
evaporation rates, the Sahara can only dry out and dry out further,
and the moisture deficit is enormous.</p>

Garamantes, emerged around <font color="#a9a9a9">500 BC. </font>in
the heart of the Sahara, in the valley now called Wadi al-Ajal in
Fezzan, Libya. The <font color="#dcdcdc">Garamantes </font>achieved
this development <font color="#2f4f4f">by digging tunnels </font><font color="#dcdcdc">deep
into the mountains lining the valley to extract fossil water </font>and
transport it to their fields. The Garamantes grew powerful and
strong, conquered their neighbours and captured many slaves (who were

uncivilised nomads. However, they did trade with the Garamantes, and
a Roman bath has been found in the Garamante capital of Garama.

<font color="#dcdcdc">administrative authorities to </font>exercise
their discretion. For most of American history, the prevailing
understanding of the rule of law in this context has been some
version of <font color="#2f4f4f">A. V. </font>Dicey's concept that
&quot;no one can be punished or legally compelled to suffer bodily
harm or property damage except for a clear violation of the law,
established in the usual lawful manner by the ordinary courts of the
land.&quot; In other words, <font color="#556b2f">individuals </font>should
be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing an action
before a general court. As the caseloads of workers' compensation
boards, public utility boards and other agencies grew, it soon became
clear that allowing judges to decide for themselves all the facts of
a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a workers' compensation
case) would drown the courts and destroy the benefits of
specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in
the first place. Even <font color="#6b8e23">US Chief Justice </font>Charles
Evans Hughes argued that &quot;there must be administration, and
<font color="#a0522d">administrators must </font>administer&quot;. By
<font color="#228b22">1941</font>, a compromise had emerged. If
administrators adopted procedures that more or less followed the
'ordinary judicial custom' of the courts, the 'ordinary courts of the
land' no longer needed to review the facts. In other words, if a &quot;day
in the Commission&quot; had passed, the rule of law did not require
another &quot;day in court&quot;. Thus the <font color="#191970">Dicey

Empire </font>was born in the <font color="#dcdcdc">7th century</font>,
but after the fall of the empire, the region was soon divided into
different regions. Most of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was
often at least nominally unified under Tibetan governments in Lhasa,
Shigatse or nearby places; these governments were at various times
overlords of the Mongols and the Chinese. The eastern <font color="#2f4f4f">Kham
and Amdo regions </font>often retained a more decentralised
indigenous political structure, divided among a number of small
principalities and tribal groups, but also often came under more
direct Chinese rule <font color="#556b2f">after the Battle of Chamdo</font>;
most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese
provinces of <font color="#6b8e23">Sichuan and Qinghai. </font>Tibet's

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the Xinhai revolution against
the Qing dynasty in <font color="#a9a9a9">1912, </font>the Qing
soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of <font color="#dcdcdc">Tibet
(Ü-Tsang)</font>. The region then declared independence in 1913
without recognition by the subsequent Republic of China government.
Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of China's Xikang. The
region retained its autonomy until 1951, when, <font color="#2f4f4f">after
the Battle of Chamdo, </font>Tibet was annexed <font color="#556b2f">to
the People's Republic of China, </font>and the previous <font color="#6b8e23">Tibetan

and central Tibet </font>as the Tibet Autonomous Region, while the
eastern regions are now mostly ethnic autonomous prefectures in
Sichuan, Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces. Tibet's political
status and exiled dissident groups are a source of tension. Tibetan
activists in Tibet have also reportedly been arrested or tortured.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Compared to other team sports, the
<font color="#a9a9a9">National Football League's </font>early season
is well structured. Each NFL team plays exactly <font color="#dcdcdc">four
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">preseason exhibition games </font>per
year, two at home and two away, except for two teams that play a
fifth game each year, the <font color="#556b2f">Pro Football Hall of
Fame Game</font>. These exhibition games, most of which take place <font color="#6b8e23">in
August</font>, are played to allow coaches to narrow the roster from
an off-season limit of <font color="#a0522d">90 </font>players to a
regular season limit of <font color="#228b22">53</font>. While the
schedule for the preseason matches is not as tight as for regular
season matches, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that
limit the choice of opponents for the preseason matches; teams are
also limited in terms of the days and times they can play these
matches. In baseball and hockey, the common practice of splitting a
team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day into two
teams is prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe,
Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and
Mexico to spread the league's popularity (such a game was proposed
for China, but was eventually cancelled due to financial and
logistical problems). The league has quietly banned the playing of
non-league opponents, with the last inter-league match played in
1972, and the last match against a non-NFL team (the All-NFL rookie
College All-Stars) played in <font color="#191970">1976.</font>
Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent
having to pay regular season prices for two home exhibition games as
part of a season ticket package. Fans and fan groups have brought
numerous lawsuits against the NFL or its member teams for this
practice, but none have succeeded in stopping it. The <font color="#8b0000">Pro
Bowl, </font>traditionally played after the end of the NFL season
(since 2011 it is played the week before the Super Bowl), is also
considered a showcase game.</p>

However, these matches can backfire and cause damage in the polls and
public opinion, especially if the higher ranked team loses, when the

detrimental to a team's overall strength. Matches played by an FBS

University can be traced back to a <font color="#a9a9a9">meeting on
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">May 31, 1850, </font>attended by <font color="#2f4f4f">nine
</font>prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and lawyers
who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve the
area once known as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, <font color="#556b2f">the
Illinois General Assembly </font>granted a charter to the Board of
Trustees of North-Western University, making it the first chartered
university in Illinois. The school's nine founders, all <font color="#6b8e23">Methodists
</font>(<font color="#a0522d">three </font>of them ministers), knelt
in prayer and worship before the first organizational meeting.
Although they affiliated the university with the <font color="#228b22">Methodist
</font><font color="#191970">Episcopal </font><font color="#8b0000">Church</font>,
they were committed to non-denominational admission, believing that

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">John Evans, after whom Evanston is
named, bought 379 acres (153 ha) of land on the shores of Lake
Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would
become the town of Evanston, Illinois. The first building, <font color="#a9a9a9">Old
College</font>, opened on November 5, 1855. To raise funds for its
construction, Northwestern sold <font color="#dcdcdc">$100 &quot;perpetual
scholarships&quot; that </font>entitled <font color="#556b2f">the
purchaser and his heirs to </font>free tuition. The second building,
University Hall, was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as
the Chicago Water Tower, also built in 1869 and one of the few
buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Fire of 1871.
In 1873, <font color="#6b8e23">Evanston College for Ladies </font>merged
with Northwestern, and <font color="#a0522d">Frances Willard</font>,
who later became known as a suffragette and one of the founders of
the Women's <font color="#228b22">Christian Temperance </font>Union
(WCTU), became the school's first female dean. Willard Residential
College (1938) is named in her honour. Northwestern admitted its
first female students in 1869, and the first woman graduated in 1874.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Like other American research
universities, Northwestern was transformed by <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Second World War</font>. Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from
1939 to 1949, when <font color="#dcdcdc">nearly 50,000 </font>military
officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago
campuses. After the war, the increased student population brought
about by the <font color="#2f4f4f">G.I. Bill </font>led to a massive
expansion of both campuses. In 1948, the renowned anthropologist
Melville J. Herskovits founded the <font color="#556b2f">African
Studies Program at Northwestern</font>, the first of its kind at an
American academic institution. J. Roscoe Miller's presidency from
1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston
campus, the construction of the Lake Michigan Reservoir, faculty
growth and new academic programs, and the polarizing Vietnam-era
student protests. In 1978, Northwestern University was the site of
the <font color="#6b8e23">first and second </font>Unabomber attacks.
Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained for most of
the post-war period due to disruptive student activism, disputes over
municipal zoning, building codes and law enforcement, and
restrictions on alcohol sales near campus until 1972. Northwestern's
exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its
original charter has historically been a source of tension between
the city and the town.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The professional schools were
established at different times in the university's history, and were
originally scattered throughout Chicago. The 1917 Chicago Central
Campus Master Plan and President Walter Dill Scott's capital campaign
included the purchase of <font color="#a9a9a9">8.5 </font>acres (3.44
ha) of land at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for
$1.5 million in 1920. Architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned
to draw up a master plan for the main buildings on the new campus,
which he designed in the <font color="#dcdcdc">Collegiate Gothic
</font>style. In 1923, <font color="#2f4f4f">Mrs Montgomery Ward
</font>donated $8 million to a campaign to fund the construction of
the <font color="#556b2f">Montgomery Ward Memorial </font><font color="#6b8e23">Building
</font>to house the College of <font color="#a0522d">Medicine and
Dentistry</font>, as well as donations for faculty chairs, research
grants, scholarships and building maintenance. The building would
become the first university skyscraper in the United States. In
addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall for the
business school and Levy Mayer Hall for the law school. The new
campus, consisting of these three new buildings, was inaugurated in a
two-day ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued to expand
with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939. In
October 2013, Northwestern began demolition of the architecturally
significant Prentice Women's Hospital. Eric G. Neilson, dean of the
School of Medicine, wrote an opinion piece equating the preservation
of the building with the loss of life.</p>

wildcats when the opposing team is in control of the ball, while
simulating a paw with their hand. They also <font color="#dcdcdc">rattle
the keys </font>at the start of every kick-off<font color="#dcdcdc">.
In the </font>past, before the tradition was abandoned, <font color="#2f4f4f">pupils
used to throw marshmallows during games</font>. The clock tower at
the Rebecca Crown Center glows <font color="#556b2f">purple </font>instead
of the usual white after a winning game, signaling the happy news.
The clock tower will remain purple <font color="#6b8e23">until a loss

In the past, the bell tower only lit up for football victories, but
now men's basketball and women's lacrosse victories are also worth
celebrating; important victories in other sports can also be
commemorated.</p>

Field (formerly known as Dyche Stadium); the basketball, wrestling
and volleyball teams play <font color="#a9a9a9">at the Welsh-Ryan
Arena</font>. Northwestern's sports teams are nicknamed the <font color="#dcdcdc">Wildcats</font>.

and informally as '<font color="#6b8e23">The Fighting Methodists</font>'.
The name Wildcats was given to the university in 1924 by Chicago
Daily Tribune writer Wallace Abbey, who wrote that even in defeat to
the University of Chicago, &quot;The football players had not come
from Evanston; the Wildcats would be a name better suited to [Coach
Glenn] Thistletwaite's boys.&quot; The name was so popular that
university board members made &quot;Wildcats&quot; an official
nickname just months later. In 1972, the student body voted to change
the official nickname from &quot;Wildcats&quot; to &quot;<font color="#a0522d">Purple
Haze,&quot; </font>but the new name never stuck.</p>
