consider a UK constitution. One of the Commission's main aims was to
<font color="#663399">explore ways of giving Scotland more autonomy

strategy of Islamising society through <font color="#8b0000">revolution
</font><font color="#483d8b">or invasion </font>by means of a seized
state power; at the other, a &quot;reformist&quot; pole, Islamists
seek to gradually Islamise society &quot;from the bottom up&quot;.
These movements have, according to one journalist (Robin Wright),
&quot;arguably changed the Middle East more than any trend since the
modern states became independent&quot; and have redefined &quot;politics

</font><font color="#dcdcdc">division </font>within Islamism is
described by Graham E. Fuller between the fundamentalist &quot;guardians
of tradition&quot; (Salafists, such as those of the Wahhabi movement)
and the &quot;vanguard of change and Islamic reform&quot; centred
around the Muslim Brotherhood. Olivier Roy argues that '<font color="#2f4f4f">Sunni
</font>pan-Islamism underwent a major transformation in the second
half of the 20th century', when it was supplanted by the Muslim
Brotherhood movement and its Salafist movement, which focused on the
Islamisation of pan-Arabism, emphasising '<font color="#556b2f">sharia
</font><font color="#6b8e23">rather than Islamic
institution-building</font>' and rejecting Shi'a Islam. Since the
Arab Spring, Roy has described Islamism as &quot;increasingly
dependent&quot; on <font color="#228b22">democracy </font>in much of
the Arab-Muslim world, so that &quot;neither can survive without the
other&quot;. While Islamist political culture itself may not be
democratic, Islamists need democratic elections <font color="#8b0000">to
maintain their legitimacy</font>. At the same time, their popularity
is so great that no government can call itself democratic if it
excludes mainstream Islamist groups.</p>

was &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">quiet&quot; </font>about Israel for
some decades before the first Palestinian intifada in 1987, focusing

closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood
announced the creation of <font color="#dcdcdc">HAMAS </font>(&quot;fervour&quot;),
dedicated to jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate
than the PLO, Hamas' 1988 charter set out a more uncompromising

'ideological and political arm of the regime'. In Pakistan, this
top-down Islamisation was 'probably' more complete 'than in any other
regime except Iran and Sudan', but many Islamists also criticised
Zia-ul-Haq for using 'symbols' instead of substance and for using
Islamisation to legitimise <font color="#191970">his coups.</font>

&quot;imperium&quot;, which means to rule over vast territories.
Imperialism is &quot;a policy aimed at extending the power and

the use of </font><font color="#556b2f">military force </font><font color="#2f4f4f">or

political and economic domination of the West (and <font color="#8b0000">Japan</font>),
particularly in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Scholars continue to argue about its exact meaning. Some authors,

periphery.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The definition of <font color="#a9a9a9">imperialism
has </font>not been definitively defined for centuries, and was
confusingly seen as representing the policies of the great powers or
simply generalised <font color="#dcdcdc">aggression</font>.
Subsequently, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism in a
slightly more discriminatory way to mean any form of domination or
control by one group of people over another. To clear up this
confusion over the definition of imperialism, one could speak of
<font color="#2f4f4f">'</font><font color="#556b2f">formal</font><font color="#2f4f4f">'
</font>and <font color="#6b8e23">'</font><font color="#a0522d">informal</font><font color="#228b22">'

'full-scale colonial domination', while the latter means less direct
domination, although it does include discernible forms of domination.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">&quot;The word 'empire' comes from
the Latin word imperium, for which the closest modern English
equivalent might be 'sovereignty' or simply 'to rule'.&quot; The main
<font color="#a9a9a9">characteristic of </font>an empire is the
amount of land a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power
grew from conquering <font color="#dcdcdc">land</font>, but cultural
and economic aspects flourished through <font color="#2f4f4f">maritime
and trade routes</font>. The difference between empires is that
&quot;while political <font color="#556b2f">empires </font>were built
mainly by expansion over land, economic and cultural influences
spread at least as much <font color="#6b8e23">by sea</font>&quot;.
Some of the most important aspects of trade across the seas were
animal and vegetable products. European empires in Asia and Africa
'have come to be regarded as classic forms of imperialism, and most
books on the subject are confined to European maritime empires'.
European expansion caused the world to be divided according to how
developed and developing countries were described by <font color="#191970">world
systems theory.</font> The two main areas are the core and the
periphery. The core consists of high-income and high-profit regions;
the periphery is at the opposite end of the spectrum and consists of
low-income and low-profit regions. These critical theories of
geopolitics have contributed to the debate on the meaning and impact
of imperialism in the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader
<font color="#483d8b">Lenin </font>argued that &quot;imperialism was
the highest form of capitalism, and claimed that imperialism
developed after colonialism and that monopoly capitalism
distinguished it from colonialism&quot;. This idea of Lenin's
underlines how important the New Political World Order has become in
modern times. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major
economic players in the market; some states are now seen as <font color="#3cb371">empires
</font>because they have political and economic power over other
nations.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The term &quot;imperialism&quot; is
often associated with the term &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">colonialism&quot;,
but </font>many scholars have argued that the two have their own
separate definitions. Imperialism and colonialism have been used to
describe the domination, control and influence of a person <font color="#2f4f4f">or
group of people. </font>Robert Young writes that while imperialism
operates from the centre, is state policy and is developed for both
<font color="#556b2f">ideological and </font>economic reasons,
colonialism is simply development for settlement or <font color="#6b8e23">commercial
</font>intentions. In modern usage, colonialism also tends to imply a
degree of geographical separation between colonial and imperial
power. In particular, Edward Said distinguishes the difference
between imperialism and colonialism by stating that &quot;imperialism
involved 'the practice, theory and attitudes of a metropolitan centre
dominating a distant territory', whereas colonialism refers to 'the
planting of colonies in a distant territory'. Unified land empires
such as Russia or the <font color="#a0522d">Ottomans are </font>usually
excluded from discussions of colonialism. &quot;116 Thus, it can be
said that imperialism implies some form of colonialism, but
colonialism in itself does not automatically imply imperialism
because it lacks <font color="#228b22">a political focus </font>[further
clarification needed].</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Imperialism
and colonialism </font>both define a political and economic advantage
over a country and its indigenous population, but it is sometimes
difficult for scholars to illustrate the difference between the two.
While <font color="#dcdcdc">imperialism and colonialism </font>focus
on the repression of the other, where colonialism refers to <font color="#2f4f4f">the
process by which </font><font color="#556b2f">a country </font><font color="#6b8e23">takes
physical control of another country</font>, imperialism refers to
<font color="#a0522d">political and monetary domination, </font>either
formally or informally. Colonialism is seen as the architect that
decides how to begin <font color="#228b22">to control territories,
</font>and imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind
conquest in collaboration with colonialism. Colonialism is when an
imperial nation begins the <font color="#191970">conquest of a
territory </font>and is then eventually able to control the
territories that the previous nation had controlled. The essence of
colonialism <font color="#8b0000">is the </font><font color="#483d8b">exploitation
of the </font><font color="#bc8f8f">conquered nation's </font><font color="#3cb371">valuable
resources and supplies</font><font color="#663399">, whereby the
conquering nation benefits from </font>the spoils of war. The meaning
of imperialism is to create an empire <font color="#bdb76b">by
conquering the lands of another nation</font><font color="#4682b4">,
thereby increasing one</font>'<font color="#4682b4">s own supremacy.</font>
Colonialism is the colonial possessions built and maintained in a
region by a population from a foreign land. Colonialism can
completely transform the existing social structure, physical
structure and economy of a region; it is not unusual for the
<font color="#9acd32">characteristics of </font><font color="#cd5c5c">the
conquering peoples </font>to be inherited by the conquered indigenous

and justification of </font><font color="#2f4f4f">empire-building </font><font color="#556b2f">on

reasons. Friedrich Ratzel argued that <font color="#3cb371">imperialism

argued that Britain had to be one of the greatest imperialists and
therefore justified imperialism. &quot;The supposed scientific and
<font color="#663399">racial theory of </font>'<font color="#bc8f8f">Social
Darwinism' </font>provided a supposed rational justification for
imperialism. The rhetoric that the colonial conquerors were racially
superior seems to have served its purpose, since, for example,

still valued today, and various forms of 'blanqueamiento' (whitening)

is based on an essentialising discourse that does not represent the
diversity and social reality of the East. Rather, by essentialising
the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to
create a distinction and distance between the 'us' of the West and
the '<font color="#2f4f4f">them' of the </font>East, or between the
'here' of the West and the 'there' of the East. This distinction was
particularly evident in the textual and visual works of early

imperialism is when the </font>influence of one country is felt in

another country. It is more than just a matter of 'foreign' music,
television or film becoming popular with young people, but of this
popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their
hopes that their own country will become more like the foreign
country depicted. For example, during the Cold War, depictions of the
lavish American lifestyle in the soap opera <font color="#2f4f4f">Dallas
</font>changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example

imperialism was influential, and that Europeans rejected the notion
that 'imperialism' required formal, legal domination by one
government of another. &quot;Historians, they argued, are fascinated
by formal empires and maps of the world with regions coloured in red.
Most British emigration, trade and capital went to areas outside the
formal British Empire. Central to their thinking is the idea of
empire 'informally if possible, and formally if
necessary'.&quot;[attribution needed] The resources made available by

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In English-language academic works,
theories of imperialism are often based on <font color="#a9a9a9">British
</font>experience. The term 'imperialism' was originally introduced
into the English language in its current sense in the <font color="#2f4f4f">late
</font><font color="#556b2f">1870s </font>by opponents of the
allegedly aggressive and pompous imperialist policies of British
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was soon adopted by imperialists
such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism was a policy based
on <font color="#6b8e23">idealism and </font><font color="#a0522d">philanthropy</font>,
others argued that it was characterised by political selfishness, and
an increasing number associated it with capitalist greed. The liberal
John A. Hobson and the Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more
theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in
particular had a major influence on later Marxist conceptions of
imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of
Capitalism, in which Lenin described imperialism as a natural
extension of capitalism, born out <font color="#228b22">of the need
for capitalist </font><font color="#191970">economies to </font><font color="#8b0000">constantly
expand investment</font><font color="#483d8b">, material resources
and labour in such a way </font><font color="#3cb371">that colonial
expansion was necessary.</font> Subsequent Marxist theorists echo
this view of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism. Many
theorists on the left have followed them in emphasising the
structural or systemic nature of 'imperialism'. Such writers have
expanded the time period associated with the term so that it no
longer refers to politics or the brief period of the late 19th
century decades, but to a global system spanning centuries, often
going back to Christopher Columbus and in some cases to <font color="#bc8f8f">the
Crusades.</font> As the use of the term has expanded, its meaning has
changed along five distinct but often parallel axes: moral, economic,
systemic, cultural and temporal. These changes reflect - among other
shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, about
power, especially Western power.</p>

have long debated the relationship between capitalism, <font color="#a9a9a9">aristocracy

such as J.A. Hobson (1858-1940), Joseph Schumpeter (1883-1950),
Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929) and Norman Angell (1872-1967). Although

</font><font color="#2f4f4f">the First World War</font><font color="#556b2f">,
</font>they remained active in the inter-war period. Their joint work
contributed to the study of imperialism and its effects in Europe and
to reflections on the rise of the US military-political complex from
the <font color="#a0522d">1950s </font>onwards. Hobson argued that
<font color="#228b22">domestic social reforms </font>could cure the
international <font color="#191970">disease of </font>imperialism <font color="#8b0000">by
removing its economic basis</font><font color="#483d8b">. </font>Hobson

Japan occupied parts of the Far East from Russia and parts of Eastern
Siberia as part of its intervention in Siberia. In 1931, Japan
conquered <font color="#556b2f">Manchuria </font>from China. During
the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the Japanese army invaded
central China, and by the end of the Pacific War, Japan had conquered
much of the Far East, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Indonesia, part of New Guinea and some
Pacific islands. Japan also invaded <font color="#6b8e23">Thailand

Japan's colonial ambitions ended with the US victory in World War II

</font>wrote extensively on the subject and famously declared that
imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. After Lenin's death,
however, Joseph Stalin established '<font color="#6b8e23">socialism
in </font><font color="#a0522d">one country</font><font color="#228b22">'
</font>for the Soviet Union, creating a model for later
inward-looking Stalinist states and purging the early
internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the
early revolution were abandoned until they returned during the Cold
War in the framework of a client state competing with the Americans.
At the beginning of a new era, the post-Stalin period, which was
called the 'thaw', in the late 1950s, the new political leader <font color="#191970">Nikita
</font><font color="#8b0000">Khrushchev </font>further increased the
pressure on Soviet-US relations by launching a new wave of
anti-imperialist propaganda. In a speech to the UN Conference in
1960, he announced the continuation of the war against imperialism
and stated that the peoples of the various countries would soon come
together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet
Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it had
tendencies common to historical empires. Some scholars argue that the
Soviet Union was a hybrid, containing elements common to both
multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that
the Soviet Union practised colonialism like other imperial powers and
continued the old Russian tradition of expansion and governance. <font color="#483d8b">Mao
Zedong </font>once claimed that the Soviet Union had become an
imperialist superpower while maintaining a socialist façade.
Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widespread in the activities
of the higher levels of government. Non-Russian Marxists in the
Russian Federation and later in the Soviet Union, such as <font color="#3cb371">Sultan
Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, </font>saw the Soviet regime as a reformed

on <font color="#a9a9a9">mercantilism, with </font>colonies and
possessions mainly in North America, the Caribbean and India. Its
growth stalled when the American colonies were lost in <font color="#dcdcdc">1776.

By the 1840s, Britain had adopted a highly successful <font color="#6b8e23">free

turned its attention to Asia, Africa and the Pacific. After the fall

backed by military force, but more often they were influenced from
behind the scenes. This corresponds to the general perception of
hegemony and empire in historical empires. In 1898, anti-imperialist
Americans founded the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the
annexation of the <font color="#191970">Philippines </font>and Cuba

differs from the <font color="#2f4f4f">informal imperialism of the

This internal form of imperialism also differs from the formation of
'colonies' abroad by the United States. Through its treatment of
indigenous peoples during the process of Western expansion, the
United States assumed a form of imperialist power before the attempts
of external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been called
<font color="#556b2f">'</font><font color="#6b8e23">internal
colonialism</font><font color="#556b2f">'</font>. The involvement in
the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of <font color="#a0522d">12-15
million </font>Africans is seen by some as a more modern extension of
America's 'internal colonialism'. However, this internal colonialism
met with resistance, as did external colonialism, but the
anti-colonial presence was much less pronounced because the United
States was able to exercise almost total domination over both
indigenous peoples and African Americans. In his lecture of 16 April
2003, Edward Said made a bold statement on modern US imperialism,
which he described as aggressive invasion of the <font color="#191970">modern
East </font><font color="#8b0000">'</font>because of its backward way
of life, lack of democracy and violation of women's rights'. In this

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The first historical mention of
Warsaw dates back to <font color="#a9a9a9">1313</font>, when <font color="#dcdcdc">Kraków
</font>was the capital of Poland. Thanks to its central location
between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth capitals of Kraków and
Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown
of the Kingdom of Poland when <font color="#2f4f4f">King Sigismund
III Vaasa </font>moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in <font color="#556b2f">1596</font>.
After the third partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated
into the Kingdom of Prussia. During the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, the
city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a
puppet state of the First French Empire founded by Napoleon
Bonaparte. Following the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the
Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the
'Kingdom of Congress'. It was not until 1918 that Warsaw became
independent and became the new capital of the independent Republic of
Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish
population and deportation to concentration camps led to the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and the great and devastating Warsaw Uprising
in August-October 1944. Warsaw was given the title &quot;City of
Phoenix&quot; <font color="#6b8e23">because </font><font color="#a0522d">it
has </font><font color="#228b22">survived many wars, conflicts and
invasions </font><font color="#6b8e23">over its long history</font>.
Above all, the city required careful reconstruction after the
extensive damage it suffered in the Second World War, when 85% of its
buildings were destroyed. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded
Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari, for
heroism during the siege of Warsaw (1939).</p>

the Królikarnia (1782-1786), the Carmelite Church (facade 1761-1783)

economic growth of the early years of Congress Poland led to a rapid
rise in architecture. The neoclassical revival influenced all aspects
of architecture, the most notable being the Great Theatre (1825-1833)
and the buildings on the Bank Square (1825-1828).</p>

The park is distinguished from other green spaces in Warsaw by the
presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen walking freely
here, and royal carps living in the pond. Wilanów Palace Park dates
back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers an area of 43

forms of the palace. In the eastern part of the park, closest to the
palace, there is a two-level garden with a terrace overlooking the
pond. The park surrounding the Królikarnia Palace is located on the

population of 638 000, 219 000 (<font color="#556b2f">about </font>34%)
were Jewish, and Warsaw's more than 350 000 Jews before the war
accounted for about 30% of the city's total population. In 1933, <font color="#228b22">833
500 </font>of the 1 178 914 inhabitants were native Polish speakers.
The Second World War changed the demographic structure of the <font color="#191970">city
and today </font>ethnic diversity is much less diverse than in the
300 years before Warsaw. Most of today's population growth is due to

registration</font>: only spouses and children of permanent residents

to register, halving population growth in the following years. It

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The basic unit of territorial
division in Poland is the <font color="#dcdcdc">municipality </font>(gmina).
A town is also a <font color="#2f4f4f">municipality, </font>but has a
<font color="#556b2f">town charter.</font> Both cities and
municipalities are headed by a mayor, but in municipalities the mayor
is a vogt (Polish: wójt) and in cities a burmistrz. Some larger
cities are granted rights, or functions and privileges, which belong
to the second tier of territorial units, the <font color="#6b8e23">counties
or powiats.</font> An example of such a right is car registration: a
gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. the
registration number depends on the powiat in which the car is
registered, not the gmina). In this case, we are talking about the
city district or powiat grodzki. Such cities include Lublin, Krakow,
Gdańsk, Poznań, etc. <font color="#a0522d">In Warsaw, </font>its
districts also have some powiat rights - such as the already
mentioned car registration. For example, the Wola district has its
own certificates and the Ursynów district has its own (and cars in
Wola have a different registration number from those in Ursynów).
But, for example, <font color="#228b22">Kraków </font>district does
not have powiat rights, so Kraków registration numbers are the same
in all districts.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The conflict is known by several
names. In British America, wars were often named after a sitting
British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War.
Because King George's War had already been fought <font color="#a9a9a9">in
the 1740s</font>, British colonists named the Second War of <font color="#dcdcdc">King
George's reign </font>after their opponents, and it became known as
the French and Indian War. This traditional name is still established
in the United States, but <font color="#2f4f4f">it </font><font color="#556b2f">obscures

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Further south, the southeastern
interior was dominated by the Siouan-speaking Catawba<font color="#dcdcdc">,
the Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw</font>, and the
Iroquois-speaking Cherokee. When the war broke out, the French used
their trade connections to recruit fighters <font color="#2f4f4f">from

Lakes </font><font color="#a0522d">region </font>(an area not

Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago and Potawatomi. The British
received support in the war from the <font color="#191970">Iroquois
</font><font color="#8b0000">Six Nations </font><font color="#483d8b">and
also from the Cherokees </font>- until disagreements led to the
Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758, the Pennsylvania government
successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which several tribes
in the Ohio region promised neutrality in exchange for land cessions
and other benefits. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the
French, who were their primary trading partner and supplier of arms.
Both the French and the British made diplomatic efforts to gain the
Creek and Cherokee either their support or neutrality in the
conflict. It was not uncommon for small forces to be involved on the
&quot;other side&quot; of the conflict from formally negotiated
agreements, as most tribes were dispersed and troops made their own
decisions about warfare.</p>

contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire disparagingly called
Canada just a few hectares of snow. The English, on the other hand,
were happy to take New France because defending their North American
colonies would no longer be a problem and because they already had
plenty of places to get their sugar from. Spain, which traded Florida
to Britain to get Cuba back, also received Louisiana and New Orleans
from France to compensate for its losses. Britain and Spain also
agreed that shipping on the Mississippi River would be open to ships
of all nations.</p>

best a temporary barrier to the rising tide of settlers to the west.
The Proclamation also contained provisions that prevented Roman
Catholics from becoming citizens of Canada. When adjustments were
made to the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other problems,
religious concerns arose in the largely Protestant thirteen colonies
about the advance of the &quot;pope&quot;; the Act preserved French
civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval provision
that the French Revolution abolished in France soon within a
generation.</p>

</font>introduced the philosophical discussion of the concept of
force as an integral part of <font color="#dcdcdc">Aristotelian
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">cosmology</font>. In Aristotle's view,
the terrestrial sphere contained <font color="#556b2f">four </font>elements
resting in its various 'natural places'. Aristotle believed that the
immovable objects of the Earth, consisting mainly of the elements
earth and water, were in their natural place <font color="#a0522d">on
the Earth and </font>that they would remain there if left <font color="#228b22">alone</font>.
He distinguished between the natural tendency of objects to find
their 'natural place' (e.g. <font color="#191970">the falling of
heavy objects</font>), which led to '<font color="#8b0000">natural
motion', </font>and <font color="#483d8b">unnatural </font>or forced
motion, which required <font color="#3cb371">the constant application
of force.</font> This theory, based on everyday experience of how
objects move, such as the constant application of force required to
keep a cart in motion, had conceptual difficulties explaining
projectile behaviour such as the flight of arrows. The point at which
the archer moved the projectile was at the beginning of flight, and
when the projectile sailed through the air, there was no discernible
effective cause. <font color="#bc8f8f">Aristotle </font>was aware of
this problem and proposed that the air displacing the projectile on
its journey carried the projectile to its destination. This
explanation implies an air-like continuum for the change of position
in general.</p>

</font>equilibrium was first described by <font color="#dcdcdc">Galileo</font>,
who noticed that certain assumptions of <font color="#2f4f4f">Aristotelian
</font>physics were at odds with observation and logic. Galileo
realised that a simple increase in velocity implied that the concept
of 'absolute rest' did not exist. <font color="#556b2f">Galileo
</font>concluded that motion at a constant speed was equivalent to
absolute <font color="#6b8e23">rest</font>. This was contrary to
<font color="#228b22">Aristotle's </font>notion of &quot;natural
rest&quot;, which bodies of mass naturally approach. Simple
experiments showed that Galileo's conception of the equivalence
between constant velocity and rest was correct. For example, if a
sailor dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at
a constant speed, Aristotelian physics would predict that the
cannonball would fall <font color="#191970">straight down </font>as
the ship moved underneath it. In <font color="#8b0000">the

land <font color="#483d8b">behind </font>the<font color="#483d8b">
foot of the mast of the</font><font color="#3cb371"> moving ship.
</font>However, when this experiment is actually carried out, the
cannonball always falls <font color="#008080">at the foot of the
mast, as </font>if the cannonball knows it is going with the ship,
even though it is away from it. Since there is no forward horizontal
force on the cannonball as it falls, the only remaining conclusion is
that the cannonball continues to move at the same speed as the ship
as it falls. Therefore, no force is needed to keep the cannonball
moving at a constant forward speed.</p>

Standard Model predicts the as yet undetected Higgs mechanism, but
observations such as neutrino oscillations show that the Standard
Model is incomplete. A grand unified theory, which would allow the
combination of electroweak interactions and a strong force, is
considered possible, and theoretical candidates such as supersymmetry
are proposed to solve some of the unsolved problems in physics.
