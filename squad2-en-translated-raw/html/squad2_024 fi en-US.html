<font color="#a9a9a9">minority leaders are usually experienced
legislators when they are elected to this position</font>. When Nancy
Pelosi (D-CA) became Minority Leader <font color="#dcdcdc">in the

years and as Minority Leader in the 107th Congress. When his

Leader </font>in the 104th Congress, he had served in the House for
nearly <font color="#556b2f">20 years</font>, had chaired the

been the 1988 presidential candidate, and had been Majority Leader
<font color="#228b22">from June 1989 until the Republicans took

Longworth in 1925 and continuing through the Democratic-dominated
<font color="#a9a9a9">House of Representatives </font>from 1931 to
1995, with the exception of Republican majorities in 1947-49 and
1953-55, all majority leaders have ascended directly to the Speaker's
office upon the incumbent's retirement. The only exceptions during
this period were Charles A. Halleck, who became <font color="#dcdcdc">House
Republican leader and minority leader </font>from 1959 to 1965, <font color="#2f4f4f">Hale
Boggs</font>, who died in <font color="#556b2f">a plane crash, </font>and
Dick Gephardt, who became House Democratic leader but as minority
leader because his party lost power in the 1994 midterm elections.
Since 1995, the only majority leader to become Speaker is <font color="#6b8e23">John
Boehner, </font>albeit indirectly, because his party lost power in
the 2006 mid-term elections. He then served as <font color="#a0522d">Leader
and Minority Leader of the Republican House of Representatives </font><font color="#228b22">from
2007 to 2011</font>, before being elected Speaker when the House
reconvened in 2011. In 1998, when Speaker Newt Gingrich announced his

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Traditionally, <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Speaker </font>is considered the leader of the majority party in the
House of Representatives, and the <font color="#dcdcdc">Majority
Leader </font>is his deputy. For example, when the Republicans won
the majority in the House of Representatives <font color="#2f4f4f">after
the 2010 elections</font>, Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner <font color="#556b2f">as
Majority Leader</font>. Despite this, Cantor and his successor Kevin

</font>political scientist <font color="#a9a9a9">Randall Ripley,
</font>since 1883, &quot;the minority party's candidate for president
has been the clear minority leader&quot;. However, this claim is open
to debate. On 3 December 1883, the House of Representatives elected
Democrat John G. Carlisle of Kentucky as Speaker. The Republican
nominee for Speaker was J. Warren Keifer of Ohio, who had served as
Speaker in the previous Congress. Keifer was clearly not the
Republican minority leader. He was a discredited leader partly
because as Speaker <font color="#dcdcdc">he </font><font color="#2f4f4f">arbitrarily
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">handed out </font><font color="#2f4f4f">'elective
office to close relatives </font><font color="#556b2f">... all on
handsome salaries'. </font>Keifer received the &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">empty
glory of a minority nomination&quot;</font>. But with it came the
sting - for while this naturally goes with the Speakership, his
<font color="#a0522d">[party] associates </font>abandoned him, and
<font color="#228b22">his career as a national figure ended in
disgrace. &quot;</font>Subsequently, <font color="#191970">Representative
</font><font color="#8b0000">Thomas Reed </font><font color="#483d8b">(</font>R-ME),
who later became Speaker, replaced Keifer as Minority Leader.
&quot;Although Keifer was the minority candidate for Speaker, Reed
became its recognized leader, and as long as he was in the House, he
remained the most visible member of his party.</p>

to believe that the party supporters in the House of Representatives
would appoint a man to the office of Speaker when he is in the
majority, and appoint him to that office when he is in the minority,
and not expect legislative guidance from him.&quot; According to some

<font color="#2f4f4f">Urashtu (Babylonian) as Armina (Old Persian;

are attested as 'Armenians' from about the same period, and perhaps
the earliest reference is in a fragment dedicated to <font color="#556b2f">Hecataeus
of Miletus </font>(<font color="#6b8e23">476 BC</font>). The Greek
general <font color="#a0522d">Xenophon</font>, who served on some

In the late Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian
country, but with the advent of Christianisation, the Zoroastrianism
and paganism that had previously prevailed in Armenia gradually
declined. Later, <font color="#a0522d">Mesrop Mashtots </font>invented
the <font color="#228b22">Armenian alphabet </font>in 405 AD to
further strengthen Armenian national identity. This event marked the
beginning of the Golden Age of Armenia, during which Mesrop's
students translated many foreign books and manuscripts into Armenian.
Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rival Byzantine
and Sassanid Persian empires, until the Persian Muslim invasion also
took over the territories where the Armenians lived.</p>

often considered the golden age of Armenian literature. Early
Armenian literature was written by the <font color="#2f4f4f">'father
of Armenian history'</font>, <font color="#556b2f">Moses Chorene, </font>who
wrote the <font color="#6b8e23">history of Armenia</font>. The book
covers the period from the formation of the Armenian nation until the
5th century AD. The 19th century saw a major literary movement, which
gave birth to modern Armenian literature. This period, during which
Armenian culture flourished, is known as the Age of Awakening
(Zartonki sherchan). The writers of the Constantinople and Tiflis
revival movements, who were almost identical to <font color="#a0522d">the
</font>European <font color="#a0522d">Romantics, were </font>interested
in promoting Armenian nationalism. Most of them adopted newly created
eastern or western variants of Armenian, depending on the target
audience, and considered them preferable to classical Armenian
(grabar). This period ended after the Hamidian massacres, when
Armenians experienced a period of unrest. When the <font color="#228b22">history
of the Armenians and the genocide of the 1920s </font>began to be
discussed more openly, writers such as Paruyr Sevak, Gevork Emin,
Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz ushered in a new literary era.</p>

genocide </font>caused widespread emigration, which led to Armenians
settling in different countries around the world. Armenians held on
to their traditions, and certain diaspora settlers rose to fame with
their music. In the post-genocide Armenian community in the United
States, the so-called <font color="#dcdcdc">'kef' style of </font>Armenian
dance music was popular, using <font color="#2f4f4f">Armenian and
Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and
some Western instruments.</font> This style preserved the folk songs
and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played
contemporary folk songs from Turkey and other Middle Eastern
countries from which Armenians had migrated. <font color="#556b2f">Richard
Hagopian </font>is perhaps the best known performer of <font color="#6b8e23">the
traditional &quot;kef&quot; style, and the </font>Vosbikian Band was
instrumental in the 1940s and 1950s in developing its own &quot;kef&quot;
style of music, heavily influenced by the popular American big band
jazz of the time. Later, the Armenian pop music genre, originating
from the Armenian diaspora in the Middle East and influenced by
continental European (especially French) pop music, rose to fame in
the 1960s and 1970s with artists such as <font color="#a0522d">Adiss
Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian </font>performing for the Armenian
diaspora and Armenia. Also artists like Sirusho, who perform <font color="#228b22">pop
music combined with Armenian folk music </font>in <font color="#228b22">today's
</font>entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans who have
risen to fame in classical or international music include the
world-famous <font color="#191970">French-Armenian </font>singer and
composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, well-known opera
sopranos such as <font color="#8b0000">Hasmik Papian and more
recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan</font>. Some Armenians
have taken to singing non-Armenian tunes, such as the heavy metal
band <font color="#483d8b">System of a Down </font>(which, however,
often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumental tunes and style
in its songs) or pop star Cher. Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi) is a
renowned Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has
achieved widespread national recognition for his dedication to
Armenian folk music and his exceptional talent. In the Armenian
diaspora, Armenian revolutionary songs are popular among young
people. These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and generally speak
of Armenian history and national heroes.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In <font color="#a9a9a9">1870,
</font>Charles Taze Russell and others founded a group in <font color="#dcdcdc">Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania</font>, to <font color="#2f4f4f">study the Bible</font>.
During his ministry, Russell challenged many beliefs of mainstream
Christianity, including the immortality of the soul, hellfire,
predestination, the <font color="#556b2f">bodily return of Jesus
Christ</font>, the Trinity, and the burning of the world. In 1876
Russell met <font color="#6b8e23">Nelson H. Barbour</font>; later
that year they produced a book together, <font color="#a0522d">Three
Worlds, which </font>combined Restorationist views with end-time
prophecies. The book taught that God's dealings with humanity were
divided into dispensational periods, each ending in a &quot;harvest&quot;,
that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 to
inaugurate the &quot;harvest of the Gospel Age&quot;, and that 1914
would mark the end of the 2520-year period known as the &quot;<font color="#228b22">Gentile
Age&quot;</font>, when world society would be replaced <font color="#191970">by
the full establishment of God's kingdom on earth.</font> From 1878,
Russell and Barbour co-edited the religious Herald of the Morning. In
June <font color="#8b0000">1879, they </font>parted ways over
doctrinal differences, and in July Russell began publishing Zion's
Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence, a magazine which aimed
to show that the world was in its &quot;last days&quot; and that a
new era of earthly and human restoration under the reign of Christ
was at hand.</p>

accused by members of the board of directors of acting in an

and opponents led to a significant turnover in membership over the
next decade. <font color="#556b2f">In June </font>1917, he published
The Finished Mystery as the seventh volume of Russell's Studies in

compilation of his commentaries on the books of Ezekiel and

was highly critical of <font color="#228b22">the Catholic and

patriarchs (such as Abraham and Isaac) would be resurrected in 1925,
marking the beginning of Christ's millennial kingdom. Disappointed by
the changes, the first half of Rutherford's tenure saw <font color="#191970">tens

several Bible study societies independent of the Watchtower Society,

heavenly life - based at the Watch Tower Society's Brooklyn
headquarters. Membership is not elected by ballot, but new members
are chosen by an existing body. Until late 2012, the governing body
described itself as the representative and &quot;advocate&quot; of
God's &quot;faithful and discreet slave class&quot; (some <font color="#6b8e23">10,000

publications, meeting programmes and evangelistic outreach. It
appoints all branch committee members and rotating overseers after
they have been recommended by local branch committees, and the
rotating overseers oversee the church districts in their area of
jurisdiction. The rotating overseers appoint local elders and
servants, while branch offices may appoint regional committees for
such things as building a Kingdom Hall or disaster relief.</p>

Sana all refer to <font color="#a0522d">Jesus. </font>Jesus is seen
as the sole <font color="#228b22">intercessor and high priest </font>between
God and mankind, and has been appointed by God as king and judge of
his kingdom. His mediatorial role (referred to in <font color="#191970">1

although 'other sheep' are said to benefit from the arrangement.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The central teaching of Jehovah's
Witnesses is that the present world age or &quot;system of things&quot;
entered its &quot;last days&quot; in <font color="#a9a9a9">1914 </font>and
is threatened with imminent destruction through the intervention of
God and Jesus Christ, leading to salvation for those who worship God
acceptably. They consider all other religions of today to <font color="#dcdcdc">be
false </font>and identify them with the &quot;Babylon the Great&quot;
or &quot;harlot&quot; of Revelation 17 and believe that the <font color="#2f4f4f">United
Nations </font>will soon destroy them, and they believe that it is
represented in the Bible by the scarlet-coloured wild beast of
Revelation <font color="#556b2f">17</font>. This development marks
the beginning of the &quot;great tribulation&quot;. <font color="#6b8e23">Satan
will </font>then attack Jehovah's Witnesses, prompting God to start
the War of Armageddon, during which all forms of government and all
people who are not counted as &quot;sheep&quot; or true followers of
Christ will be destroyed. After Armageddon, God will extend <font color="#a0522d">his
heavenly kingdom </font>to the earth, which will be transformed into
a Garden of Eden-like paradise. After Armageddon, most of those who
had died before God's intervention will be gradually resurrected
during the thousand-year &quot;Day of Judgement&quot;. This judgment
will be based on their actions after the resurrection rather than on
their previous actions. At the end of the millennium, Christ will
hand all power back to God. Then the final test will take place, when
Satan will be deceived into leading a perfect human race. Those who
fail will be destroyed along with Satan and his demons. The end
result is a <font color="#191970">fully tested, glorified </font><font color="#228b22">humanity.</font></p>

They base this belief on the translation of the Greek word <font color="#6b8e23">parousia

to pass final judgment </font>on people on earth. In doing so, they

<font color="#a9a9a9">in Kingdom halls, which </font>are typically
functional and do not have religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned
to the congregation in whose <font color="#dcdcdc">&quot;district&quot;

religion determines the format of the meetings, and most meetings
have the same themes all over the world. The congregations meet
weekly in <font color="#6b8e23">two </font>sessions, comprising <font color="#a0522d">five
</font>separate meetings lasting about three and a half hours in
total, usually meeting mid-week (three meetings) and on weekends (two

intention that members would devote one evening to &quot;family

(hymns) and short prayers.</font> Twice a year, witnesses from
several churches that make up a &quot;district&quot; gather for a
one-day meeting. Larger groups of churches meet once a year for a
three-day 'regional meeting', usually held in rented stadiums or

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Formal discipline is administered by
the <font color="#a9a9a9">elders of the congregation</font>. When a
baptized member is accused of serious sin - usually sexual misconduct
or apostasy for denying the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses - <font color="#dcdcdc">a
judicial committee is </font>formed to determine guilt, provide
assistance and possibly impose discipline. <font color="#2f4f4f">Expulsion</font>,
a form of <font color="#556b2f">disqualification</font>, is the most
severe form of discipline applied to an offender who is deemed
unrepentant. Contact with expelled persons is limited to <font color="#6b8e23">family
members living in the same home </font>and to elders of the
congregation who may ask the expelled person to seek reinstatement;
official business relations may continue if there is a contractual or
financial obligation to do so. Witnesses are taught that avoiding
social and spiritual contact with the disfellowshipped person <font color="#a0522d">keeps
the church free from immoral influences </font>and that &quot;losing
valuable contact with loved ones can help [the disfellowshipped
person] to 'come to his senses', see the seriousness of his
wrongdoing and take steps to return to Jehovah&quot;. The practice of
sheltering can also prevent other members from engaging in dissident
behaviour. Members who dissent (formally resign) are described in
Watchtower literature <font color="#228b22">as evil </font>and are
also shunned. Those who have resigned may eventually be readmitted to
the congregation if the elders of the congregation where the
resignation took place consider it regrettable. Reprimand is a less
severe form of discipline given by the Judicial Committee to a
formally baptised witness who is deemed to have repented of serious
sin; the reproved person <font color="#191970">temporarily </font>loses
visible ministry privileges, but suffers no restrictions on social or
spiritual fellowship. Marking, which is a restriction on social but
not spiritual fellowship, is exercised if the baptized member
continues to engage in conduct that is considered to violate biblical
principles but is not a serious sin[note 4].[note 4].</p>

Witnesses </font>have been accused of using their policies and
culture to conceal cases of <font color="#dcdcdc">sexual abuse </font>within
the organisation. The religion has been criticised for the &quot;two
witness rule&quot; of church discipline, based on the application of
<font color="#2f4f4f">Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which
</font>requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary
evidence if the accused denies any wrongdoing. In cases where
corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's advice is that
&quot;elders leave the matter in the hands of <font color="#556b2f">Jehovah</font>&quot;.
Barbara Anderson, a former employee of the church headquarters, says
the practice in practice requires that there must be another witness
to the abuse, &quot;which is impossible&quot;. Anderson says the
practice &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">protects </font><font color="#a0522d">paedophiles

Darlan </font>as High Commissioner for North Africa, although Darlan
had previously held senior government posts in Vichy France and
continued to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the French armed forces.
The Allied leaders were 'stunned' from this political point of view,
although none of them had offered Eisenhower any guidance on how to
solve this problem when planning the operation. Eisenhower was
severely criticised for the move. Darlan was assassinated on <font color="#2f4f4f">24
December by </font><font color="#556b2f">Fernand Bonnier de La
Chapelle</font>. Eisenhower took no action to prevent the arrest and
execution without trial of Bonnier de La Chapelle by Darlan's
associates, acting without Vichy or Allied authorisation, because he
considered it a criminal rather than a military matter. Eisenhower
later appointed as High Commissioner General <font color="#6b8e23">Henri

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Eisenhower and the officers and
troops under his command had learned valuable lessons in their
previous operations, and their skills had been strengthened as they
prepared for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans,
the invasion of the Gulf. His first struggles with Allied leaders and
officers, however, concerned matters vital to the success of the
Normandy invasion; he argued with Roosevelt over the necessary
agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces for <font color="#a9a9a9">covert
and sabotage operations </font>against the Germans before Overlord.
Admiral <font color="#dcdcdc">Ernest J. King </font>argued with
Eisenhower over King's refusal to supply more landing craft from the
Pacific. He also demanded that the British give him sole command of
all strategic air power to facilitate Overlord, and even threatened
to resign if Churchill did not agree, as Churchill did. Eisenhower
then devised a bombing plan in France ahead of Overlord and argued
with Churchill over his concerns <font color="#2f4f4f">about civilian
casualties</font>; <font color="#556b2f">de Gaulle said the
</font>casualties were justified once the German yoke was lifted, and
Eisenhower won. He also had to skillfully manage to retain the often

From then until the war in Europe ended on <font color="#2f4f4f">8

forces, and through ETOUSA he had administrative command of all US
forces on the Western Front north of the Alps. He was always aware of
the inevitable loss of life and suffering that the troops under his
command and their families would experience on an individual level.
This led him to visit <font color="#556b2f">every </font>division

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the success of the coastal
offensive, Eisenhower insisted that ground combat strategy remain
under his personal control, and he was involved in leading and
delivering several attacks in France against Germany. Field Marshal
Montgomery insisted that the attack by his <font color="#a9a9a9">21st
Army Group </font>be made primarily in the north, while Generals
<font color="#dcdcdc">Bradley </font>(12th US Army Group) and <font color="#2f4f4f">Devers
</font>(6th US Army Group) insisted that they be given priority in
the centre and south of the front (respectively). Eisenhower worked
tirelessly to meet the demands of rival commanders to optimise the
Allied forces, often by giving them tactical, if sometimes
ineffective, manoeuvring room; many historians conclude that this
delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, thanks to Eisenhower's
persistence, the central supply port of <font color="#6b8e23">Antwerp
</font>was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944, and
the likelihood of victory increased.</p>

European armies. In this and in his earlier high command positions,
Eisenhower demonstrated his great abilities for leadership and
diplomacy. Although he had never personally witnessed military
action, he gained the respect of the front-line commanders. He
interacted skilfully with allies such as Winston Churchill, Field

Eisenhower decided that it would be a military mistake to attack

backed down, but then wanted Eisenhower to move to Czechoslovakia for

Nuremberg trials. He classified German prisoners of war held by the
US as disarmed enemy forces (DEF), to which <font color="#6b8e23">the

the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive JCS 1067, but softened it
by bringing 400 000 tonnes of food to civilians and allowing more
fraternisation. In response to the devastation in Germany, including
food shortages and an influx of refugees, he organised the
distribution of American food and medical supplies. His actions
reflected the new American attitude that Germans were victims of the

and delayed by a lack of ships. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that
the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could
be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and
advocated its involvement in atomic bomb control. However, in
formulating policy on the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviet
Union, <font color="#2f4f4f">Truman </font>was guided by the US State

Invited by Bolesław Bierut and awarded the highest military
decoration, he was shocked by the scale of the destruction in the
city. By mid-1947, however, as East-West tensions over Germany's
economic recovery and the Greek civil war escalated, Eisenhower
relented and agreed to a policy of containment aimed at halting

Eisenhower expressed his disaffection with <font color="#dcdcdc">the

Republican supporter. The 'Draft Eisenhower' movement within the
Republican Party led him to declare himself a candidate in the 1952

<font color="#2f4f4f">Senator </font><font color="#556b2f">Robert A.

was his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and
in June 1952 he resigned his command of NATO to campaign full time.
Eisenhower won the Taft nomination after winning the critical
delegate votes in Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was known for the
simple but effective slogan 'I Like Ike'. Essential to Eisenhower's
success was his opposition to Roosevelt's Yalta policy and Truman's
policies on Korea and China - issues in which he had once
participated. When Eisenhower won the Taft nomination, he needed to
appease the right-wing old guard of the Republican Party; his choice
of Richard M. Nixon as vice-president was designed in part for this
purpose. Nixon also offered a strong anti-communist presence and
youth to counterbalance Ike's advanced age.</p>

a convoy of US Army vehicles from coast to coast. His subsequent
experience with the German autobahn road system at the end of the

highway system. He found that it was easier to move logistics across

would not only benefit military operations, but would also promote

believed that if the communists were allowed to win <font color="#2f4f4f">in

countries, from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia to India.
Similarly, the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of
neighbouring <font color="#556b2f">Mexico</font>. In that year, the
loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his
proposed European Defence Community (EDC) were serious defeats, but
he remained optimistic in opposing the spread of communism, saying:
'Long faces do not win wars'. Having threatened the French when they

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic), as well as African-American

He became the first recorded European settler in what is now known as
the Bronx. He leased land <font color="#556b2f">from the Dutch West
India Company </font>on the neck of the continent immediately north
of the Dutch settlement of Harlem (Manhattan Island) and bought more
land from local tribes. Eventually he accumulated <font color="#6b8e23">500
acres </font>(about 2 square miles or 3/4 of a square mile) between
the Harlem River and the Aquahung River, which became known as
Bronck's River or The Bronx. Dutch and English settlers called the
area Bronck's Land. The American poet William Bronk was a descendant
of Pieter Bronck, either the son or younger brother of Jonas Bronck.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Bronx is referred to both
legally and colloquially as the Borough of the Bronx. (The <font color="#a9a9a9">County
of the Bronx</font>, unlike the Bronx-wide <font color="#dcdcdc">Borough
of the Bronx</font>, does not immediately precede the Bronx in
official references, nor does the US Postal Service do so in its
database of Bronx addresses.) The borough's name, apparently after
the Bronx River, first appeared in Bronx County, which was created in
<font color="#2f4f4f">1874 </font>from a portion of <font color="#556b2f">Westchester
</font>County, and was continued in Bronx County, which was
incorporated more broadly into Westchester County in <font color="#6b8e23">1898.</font>
The use of the definite article is due to the style of referring to
rivers. Another explanation for the use of the definite article in
the borough name is that the original form of the name was possessive
or collective, referring to a family, such as The Broncks, The
Bronck's or The Broncks'.</p>

directly linked to its strategic location <font color="#a9a9a9">between

Kingsbridge, built in <font color="#dcdcdc">1693 </font>between

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The history of the Bronx in the 20th
century can be divided into four periods: a boom period from <font color="#a9a9a9">1900-29</font>,
when the population grew sixfold <font color="#dcdcdc">from 200,000
</font>in 1900 <font color="#2f4f4f">to 1.3 million </font>in 1930.
In the years following the Great Depression and World War II, growth
slowed and eventually led to a recession. The mid and late twentieth
century were difficult times as the Bronx declined from a
predominantly middle-income area to a predominantly lower-income area
with high levels of violent crime and poverty from <font color="#556b2f">1950-85.
The </font>Bronx <font color="#6b8e23">began an </font>economic and

Fort Apache, The Bronx is another film that used the grim image of
the Bronx in its plot<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font> The film's title
comes from the nickname &quot;Fort Apache&quot; for the 41st Precinct
in the South Bronx. The 1981 horror film Wolfen also used the ruins
of the Bronx as a home for werewolf-like creatures. Knights of the
South Bronx, the true story of a teacher who worked with
underprivileged children, is another Bronx-based film released in
<font color="#dcdcdc">2005. The </font>film Fuga dal Bronx, also
known as Bronx Warriors 2, was shot in the Bronx in 1983, and Escape
2000, an <font color="#2f4f4f">Italian </font>B-movie best known for
being featured in the television series Mystery Science Theatre 3000.
The plot revolves around the plans of an ominous construction company
to clear, destroy and redevelop the Bronx and a group of rebels who
seek to expose the company's murderous ways and save their homes. The
film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase &quot;Leave
the Bronx!&quot;. Many of the film's scenes were shot in Queens,
which replaced the Bronx. Rumble in the Bronx was Jackie Chan's 1995
kung fu film, the second to make the Bronx internationally famous.
Sega's Last Bronx, released in 1996, took advantage of the Bronx's
notoriety to give the name to an alternative version of post-bubble
Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare run rampant.</p>

collapse in the value of securities linked to US real estate prices,

triggered by a complex interplay between policies that promoted home

of subprime loans based on the theory that house prices would
continue to <font color="#2f4f4f">rise, </font>questionable trading

bank solvency, deteriorating credit availability and falling investor
confidence affected global equity markets, where securities suffered
heavy losses in 2008 and early 2009. The global economy slowed down
during this period as credit tightened and international trade
declined. Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented

lending, risky investments and lack of transparency by financial
institutions&quot;, government ill-preparedness and inconsistent
actions that &quot;contributed to uncertainty and panic&quot;, &quot;a
systematic breakdown in accountability and ethics&quot;, &quot;the
collapse of mortgage lending standards and mortgage securitisation&quot;,
the deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives, especially credit
default swaps, and &quot;the failure of credit rating agencies&quot;
to price risk correctly. The repeal of the <font color="#2f4f4f">Glass-Steagall

</font>for revenue and market share between mortgage lenders was
<font color="#a9a9a9">fierce </font>and the supply of creditworthy
borrowers was limited, mortgage lenders relaxed their underwriting
standards and made riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers.
Some analysts believe that mortgage lenders were controlled by
relatively conservative <font color="#dcdcdc">government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs) </font>and maintained relatively high collateral
requirements prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from
securitizers to lenders and fierce competition from private
securitizers eroded the power of the GSEs, mortgage standards fell
and risky loans increased. The worst loans were made between <font color="#556b2f">2004
and 2007</font>, when competition among <font color="#556b2f">securitizers</font>
was fiercest and the GSE's market share was lowest.</p>

of lending trends in 305 cities between 1993 and 1998 found that
Community <font color="#dcdcdc">Reinvestment Act </font>(CRA) lenders
made <font color="#a9a9a9">$467 billion </font>in mortgage loans to
low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods, representing
<font color="#2f4f4f">10% </font>of all US mortgage lending during
the period. The majority of these loans were prime loans. Subprime
loans originated by CRA institutions accounted for 3 % of the LMI
loan market in 1998, but at the beginning of the crisis, <font color="#556b2f">25
% of </font>all subprime lending was originated by CRA institutions,
and another <font color="#6b8e23">25 % of </font>subprime loans were
in some way related to the CRA. In addition, however, a 2009 analysis
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that the CRA was not
responsible for the mortgage crisis, noting that CRA rules have been
in place since 1995, while bad lending did not emerge until a decade
later. In addition, most subprime loans were not made to LMI loans
that were subject to CRA, especially in the years leading up to the
crisis, 2005-2006. The study also found no evidence that lending
under CRA rules increased default rates or that the CRA had an
indirect effect of increasing subprime lending by independent
mortgage lenders.</p>

the change in CRA rules (in 1995) and the explosion in subprime
lending is not surprising and does not absolve CRAs of blame. They
argue that the crisis was caused by two interrelated factors: the

the ultra-low interest rates introduced by the Federal Reserve <font color="#dcdcdc">after
the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.</font> Both causes had to
be present before the crisis could arise. Critics also point out that
publicly reported CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling <font color="#2f4f4f">$4.5
trillion </font>between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the
Federal Reserve classifies CRA loans as &quot;<font color="#556b2f">prime

Nobel laureate <font color="#556b2f">Joseph Stiglitz </font>explained
how the Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy -
currency creation - as a way of combating the liquidity trap. By
creating $600 billion and investing[clarification needed] this
directly into banks, the Federal Reserve intended to encourage banks
to fund more domestic loans and refinance mortgages. Instead, banks
used the money to <font color="#6b8e23">invest in </font>more

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">During a century of power struggles
between the northern Christian kingdoms, the county of Portugal
formed the southern part of the Kingdom of Galicia. Sometimes the
Kingdom of Galicia existed independently for short periods, but in
general it formed an important part of the Kingdom of Leon.
Throughout this period, the inhabitants of the Portuguese county, as
Galicians, struggled <font color="#a9a9a9">to maintain Galician
autonomy and the distinction between its language and culture
(Galician-Portuguese) and that of León, </font>whenever the Kingdom
of Galicia's position in relation to the Kingdom of León changed. As
a result of the political division, the Galician-Portuguese language
lost its unity when the Portuguese county separated from the Kingdom
of Galicia (which was a dependent kingdom of León) and created the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Kingdom of Portugal. The </font><font color="#2f4f4f">Galician
</font>and Portuguese versions of the language diverged over time as
they followed independent development paths. This began to happen
when the Kingdom of León and the Kingdom of Castile united, and
Castilian (known as <font color="#556b2f">Spanish</font>) slowly
began to influence Galician over the centuries and then tried to
replace it. The same happened to Astur-Leonese, to the point where it
has been greatly reduced or completely replaced by <font color="#6b8e23">Castilian

ethical stance that emphasises <font color="#a9a9a9">human </font>dignity

critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over dogma

perspective that affirms some notion of human <font color="#2f4f4f">freedom

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Gellius says that in his day,
humanitarianism was commonly used as a synonym for <font color="#a9a9a9">philanthropy</font>,
or kindness and benevolence towards fellow human beings. <font color="#dcdcdc">Gellius
</font>argues that this common usage is wrong and that the premodern
Latin writers, such as <font color="#2f4f4f">Cicero </font>and
others, used the word only to mean what we might call 'humane' or
'polite' scholarship, or the Greek equivalent of Paideia. Gellius
became a favourite author of <font color="#556b2f">the Italian
Renaissance</font>, and in 15th century Italy teachers and scholars
of philosophy, poetry and rhetoric were called and referred to as
'humanists'. However, modern scholars point out that Cicero (106-43
BC), who was most responsible for defining and popularising the term
humanitas, in fact often used the word in both senses, as did his
closest contemporaries. For <font color="#6b8e23">Cicero</font>, as a
lawyer, what most distinguished man from animals was <font color="#a0522d">speech</font>,
which, together with reason, could (and should) enable disputes to be
settled and people to live together in harmony and harmony under the
rule of law. Humanitas thus had two meanings from the outset, which
continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which can still be used
today to refer to both humanitarian benevolence and erudition.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">But in the mid-1700s, <font color="#a9a9a9">during
the French Enlightenment, the term began to be </font>used more
ideologically. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article published
in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of &quot;a general love of
man ... a virtue which has hitherto been entirely anonymous with us,
and which we dare to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create
a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing&quot;. In the late
1700s and early 1800s, numerous grassroots 'charities' and benevolent
societies were founded, dedicated to the healing of people and the
spread of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French
Revolution, influential religious and political conservatives such as
Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre fiercely attacked <font color="#dcdcdc">the
idea that human virtue could be created by reason alone,
independently of traditional religious institutions, </font>which
opponents of the Revolution attributed to Enlightenment philosophers
such as Rousseau, and considered it to be a deification or <font color="#2f4f4f">idolatry
of humanity.</font> Humanism began to take on a negative connotation.
The Oxford English Dictionary records that an English clergyman used
the word 'humanism' in 1812 to refer to those who believed in the
'mere humanity' of Christ (as opposed to the divine nature), namely
Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised climate, in which
established ecclesiastical bodies sought to circumnavigate the wagons
and reflexively resist political and social reforms such as the
extension of suffrage, universal schooling and the like, <font color="#556b2f">liberal
reformers and radicals </font>adopted the idea of humanism as an
alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known
for his declaration that 'property is theft') used the word
'humanism' to describe 'culte, déification de l'humanité'
('worship, deification of humanity'), and <font color="#6b8e23">Ernest
Renan, </font>in his L'avenir de la science, notes that 'humanism is
a form of worship, worship, deification of humanity': pensées de
1848 ('The future of science: thoughts from 1848') (1848-49): 'I am
deeply convinced that pure humanism will be the religion of the
future, in other words, the cult of all that is human - all life
sanctified and elevated to the level of moral value.&quot;</p>

as an organised system of thought is <font color="#a9a9a9">Zarathustra's
Gathas, </font>written <font color="#dcdcdc">between 1000 BC and 600

presents the concept of humanity as thinking beings with freedom of
choice and agency according to the intelligence each receives from
Ahura Mazda (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura
Mazda as a non-interventionist deistic divine God / Grand Architect
of the Universe is linked to a unique eschatology and ethical system
that holds each human being morally responsible for the choices they
freely make in this life for the <font color="#2f4f4f">afterlife. The
</font>importance of thought, action, responsibility and an
interventionist Creator were invoked and inspired by many European

pre-Socratic Greek philosophers <font color="#a9a9a9">Thales
Miletolae </font>and Xenophanes Colophonius were the first in the
region to attempt to explain the world through human reason rather
than myth and tradition, and can thus be considered the first Greek
humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods, and
Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time, reserving the
divine universe as a principle of unity. These Ionian Greeks were
among the first thinkers to argue that nature could be studied
separately from the supernatural world. Anaxagoras brought the spirit
of philosophy and rational inquiry from Ionia <font color="#dcdcdc">to
Athens.</font> Pericles, the leader of Athens at its height of glory,
was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratic or
rational philosophers included Protagoras (like Anaxagoras, a friend
of Pericles), famous for his famous saying that 'man is the measure
of all things', and <font color="#2f4f4f">Democritus</font>, who
proposed that matter is made up of atoms. Little of the written work
of these early philosophers has survived, and they are known mainly
from fragments and quotations from other writers, mainly Plato and
Aristotle. Later humanists also greatly admired the historian
Thucydides, who was known for his scientific and rational approach to
history. In the third century BC. <font color="#556b2f">Epicurus

Petrarch argued that to remedy this situation, careful study and

Instead, after the fall of the <font color="#6b8e23">Byzantine Empire
</font>to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox
refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study
of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism in the hope of bridging the gap
between the Greek and Roman churches and even between Christianity
itself and the non-Christian world. The refugees brought with them

optimism <font color="#a9a9a9">about human abilities, </font>but it
does not include the belief that human nature is <font color="#dcdcdc">all
good</font>, or that all people can live up to humanist ideals
without help. If anything, there is a recognition that realising

emphasis is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and
making the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925,
the English mathematician and philosopher <font color="#a0522d">Alfred
North Whitehead </font>warned: &quot;Francis Bacon's prophecy has now
come true, and man, who once dreamed himself a little below the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Religious humanism is the
combination of humanist ethical philosophy <font color="#a9a9a9">with
religious rituals </font>and beliefs that focus on human needs,
interests and abilities. Although practitioners of religious humanism
did not formally organise themselves under the name of &quot;humanism&quot;
until the late <font color="#dcdcdc">19th and early 20th centuries</font>,
non-theistic religions and human-centred ethical philosophy have a
long history. The Cult of Reason (French: Culte de la Raison) was a
deism-based religion developed by <font color="#2f4f4f">Jacques
Hébert</font>, Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their followers during
the French Revolution. In <font color="#556b2f">1793</font>, during
the French Revolution, the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral was
transformed into a &quot;temple of reason&quot;, and instead of the
Virgin Mary, the <font color="#6b8e23">Lady of Liberty</font> was for
a time displayed on several altars. In the 1850s, Auguste Comte, the
father of sociology, founded positivism, the 'religion of humanity'.
One of the earliest pioneers of modern humanist organisations was the
Humanistic Religious Association, founded in London in 1853. This
early group was democratically organised, with male and female
members participating in the election of its leadership, and promoted
knowledge of science, philosophy and the arts. The Ethical Cultural
Movement was founded in 1876. Its founder, Felix Adler, a former
member of the Free Religious Association, conceived of ethical
culture as a new religion that would preserve the ethical message at
the heart of all religions. Ethical culture was religious in the
sense that it played a dominant role in people's lives and dealt with
fundamental issues.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The polemic on humanism has
sometimes taken paradoxical turns. Early 20th century critics such as
<font color="#a9a9a9">Ezra Pound</font>, T. E. Hulme and T. S. Eliot,
saw humanism as <font color="#dcdcdc">a sentimental </font>'slut'
(Hulme) or 'a toothless old bitch' (Pound) and wanted a return to the
more masculine, authoritarian society that (they thought) existed in
the Middle Ages. Postmodern critics who are self-styled
anti-humanists, such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault,
have argued that humanism presents an all-encompassing and overly
abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then
be used as an excuse for imperialism and domination of those who are
somehow considered less human. <font color="#2f4f4f">Timothy Laurie
</font>suggests that &quot;humanism invents the human as much as it
invents the non-human animal&quot;, and he suggests that the human is
made, in his words, &quot;a place for the various qualities that have
been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality,
altruism) rather than the most ordinary (e.g. hunger, anger)&quot;.
However, philosopher <font color="#556b2f">Kate Soper </font>notes
that by accusing humanism of falling short of its own benevolent
ideals, anti-humanism often &quot;disguises humanist rhetoric&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In his book Humanism (<font color="#a9a9a9">1997)</font>,
<font color="#dcdcdc">Tony Davies </font>calls these critics
&quot;humanist anti-humanists&quot;. Critics of anti-humanism,
notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while anti-humanists may
highlight the failure of <font color="#2f4f4f">humanism to </font>fulfil
its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer their own alternative
emancipatory project. Others, such as the German philosopher
Heidegger, considered themselves <font color="#556b2f">humanists </font>on
the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought of humanism as applying
only to the German 'race' and especially to the Nazis, and were thus,
in Davies' words, anti-humanist humanists. This reading of
Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger
includes his own views and criticisms of humanism in Letter On
Humanism. Davies admits that after the horrific experiences of the
<font color="#6b8e23">20th century </font>wars, 'it should no longer
be possible to formulate phrases like 'human destiny' or 'the triumph
of human reason' without being immediately aware of the madness and
brutality they entail'. For &quot;it is almost impossible to conceive
of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason&quot;.
Yet, he continues, &quot;it would not be wise simply to abandon the
ground occupied by historical humanism. First, <font color="#a0522d">humanism
</font>is still in many cases the only possible alternative to
bigotry and persecution. Freedom to speak and write, to organise and
campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest
and disobey: all these can only be expressed in humanist terms.&quot;</p>

ancient philosophical schools, such as Epicureanism and Neoplatonism,
whose pagan wisdom humanists, like the <font color="#2f4f4f">Church
Fathers of </font>old, considered, at least initially, to be derived
from divine revelation and thus applicable to the Christian virtuous

human as alien to me' and which has been known since antiquity,
supported by <font color="#556b2f">St Augustine, took on a </font>new

appears in a play modelled on or borrowed from Menander's Greek
comedy (now lost), may have originated from a light-hearted point of

rationalism of the <font color="#dcdcdc">17th century </font>philosophers

criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig
Feuerbach. &quot;The first is political, largely French-influenced,
and projects 'the hero of human freedom'. The second is
philosophical, <font color="#2f4f4f">German</font>, pursuing the
totality and autonomy of knowledge and emphasising understanding
rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation.
These two themes converged and competed with each other in complex
ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them the boundaries

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Jurassic period extends from

beginning of the Jurassic, the supercontinent <font color="#dcdcdc">Pangaea
split into </font>the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the

Atlantic </font>did not open until the next <font color="#a0522d">Cretaceous</font>,
when Gondwana itself split in two. The Tethys Sea closed, and the
Neotethys Basin was born. The climate was warm and there were no
signs of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land
near either polar region, and there were no extensive ice sheets.
Jurassic geological discoveries are good in western Europe, where
extensive marine stretches indicate a time when much of the continent
was under shallow tropical seas; famous sites include the World
Heritage Site of the Jurassic Coast and the well-known Late Jurassic
<font color="#191970">deposits of Holzmaden and Solnhofen.</font> In
contrast, the North American Jurassic is the poorest of the Mesozoic,
with few outcrops at the surface. Although the epicontinental
<font color="#8b0000">Sundance Sea </font>left marine deposits in
parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during
the Late Jurassic, most of the sediments of this period, such as the
alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation, are continental. The
first of several massive batholiths were deposited on the northern
Cordillera in the middle of the Jurassic, marking the Nevada orogeny.
Significant Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South
America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.</p>

Quebec, Ontario and Michigan. Except for temporary marine intrusions
at higher latitudes associated with glacial depressions, Holocene
fossils have been found mainly in lake beds, floodplains and cave

because sea-level rise during this period exceeds the likely
non-Glacial rise. The post-glacial recovery in Scandinavia led to the
emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea, including much of
Finland. The region is still rising and continues to cause weak

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In medieval France, there were two
<font color="#a9a9a9">grand officers of the French crown who had
</font>police duties: <font color="#dcdcdc">the Marshal of France and
the Constable of France</font>. The military police duties of the
Marshal of France were transferred to the Marshal's Provost, whose
troops were called <font color="#2f4f4f">Marshalcy </font>because
their authority ultimately came from the Marshal. The Marshalcy dates
back to the Hundred Years' War, and some historians trace it to the
early 1200s. The second organisation, the <font color="#556b2f">Constable
</font>(<font color="#6b8e23">Connétablie in French)</font>, was
under the French Constable. The constable was established as a
military body in 1337. Under King Francis I (1515-1547), the
Maréchaussée was incorporated into the Constabulary. The resulting
force was also known as the Maréchaussée or, officially, the French
police force and marshal.</p>

Colquhoun </font>persuaded West India merchants operating in the Pool
of London on the River Thames to set up a police force <font color="#2f4f4f">in
the port </font>to prevent rampant thefts, which caused an estimated
<font color="#556b2f">£500,000 </font>worth of cargo losses each
year<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font> The idea of a police force, which
existed in France at the time, was seen as a potentially undesirable
foreign import. When Colquhoun justified the creation of a police
force because of the rigid anti-police policy in England, he based
the political argument on economic indicators to show that a police
force focused on crime prevention was 'entirely consistent with the
principle of the British constitution'. Moreover, he went so far as
to praise the French system, which, in his view, had reached <font color="#6b8e23">'</font><font color="#a0522d">the

His second contribution was the concept of preventative policing; his

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Michel Foucault argues that <font color="#a9a9a9">German
and French </font>legal scholars and practitioners of public
administration and statistics in the 17th and early 1700s developed
the current concept of the police as a state-paid and funded agent,
notably through <font color="#dcdcdc">Nicolas </font>Delamare's
<font color="#2f4f4f">Traité de la Police </font>(<font color="#556b2f">1705)</font>.
The theory of German Polizeiwissenschaft (police science) was first
developed by the 17th century Austrian <font color="#6b8e23">political
economist and civil servant </font>Philipp von Hörnigk, and more
famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi, who produced an important
theoretical work known as Cameral Theory, which dealt with policing.
Foucault quotes Magdalene Humpert, author of Bibliographie der
Kameralwissenschaften (1937), in which the author states that a
substantial bibliography of more than 4,000 volumes on the practice
of police science has been produced. However, this may be a
mistranslation of Foucault's own work, as Magdalene Humpert's actual
source states that more than 14 000 volumes have been produced since
the 16th century, dating from 1520 to 1850.</p>

</font>Chadwick's <font color="#dcdcdc">1829 </font>article in the<font color="#2f4f4f">
London Review, </font>&quot;Preventive police&quot;, argued that
<font color="#556b2f">prevention </font>should be the primary
objective of the police, but this was not the case in practice<font color="#dcdcdc">.</font>
The reason for this, according to Chadwick, was that 'the preventive
police would act more directly by making it more difficult to obtain
the objects of temptation'. Unlike <font color="#6b8e23">the
deterrent of punishment, </font>a preventive police force would deter
crime by making crime cost-effective - 'crime doesn't pay'. In the
second draft of the 1829 Police Act, Robert Peel changed the 'object'
of the new Metropolitan Police to a 'main object', which was 'the
prevention of crime'. Subsequent historians attributed Peel's
preventive principle, ingrained in the police system, to the fact
that England had 'a look of order and a love of public order'.</p>

to be used from the early 1990s to describe forms of policing that
transcend the borders of the sovereign nation state (Nadelmann,

These terms refer, in varying degrees, to policing practices and

exchange of criminal intelligence between police forces in different

this was the <font color="#2f4f4f">Prussian </font>police's

The interest of public police authorities in cross-border cooperation
in the control of political radicalism and ordinary crime originated
mainly in Europe, eventually leading to the creation of <font color="#556b2f">Interpol
</font>before the Second World War. There are also many interesting
examples of cross-border policing by private and municipal police
forces dating back to the 19th century (Nadelmann, 1993). Modern
policing has been found to cross national borders at times almost
from the beginning. It is also generally agreed that <font color="#6b8e23">in
the post-Cold War period </font>this type of practice has become more
significant and widespread (Sheptycki, 2000).</p>

done on international and transnational information and intelligence
sharing practices. A notable exception is James Sheptyck's study of
police cooperation in the <font color="#a9a9a9">English Channel
</font><font color="#dcdcdc">region </font>(<font color="#2f4f4f">2002),
which </font>systematically analyses the content of
information-sharing files and describes how this international
exchange of information and intelligence is translated into
case-by-case police work. The study showed that cross-border police
information exchange had been routinised in the English Channel
region since <font color="#556b2f">1968</font>, based directly on
agreements between police forces, without any formal agreement
between the countries concerned. The signing of the Schengen
Agreement in <font color="#6b8e23">1992</font>, which <font color="#a0522d">formalised
aspects of police information exchange within the European Union</font>,
raised concerns that much, if not all, of this intelligence exchange

accountability mechanisms governing police information exchange in
Europe (Joubert and Bevers, 1996).</p>

<font color="#2f4f4f">Intelligence-led </font>policing is now common

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The study of genocide has focused
mainly on <font color="#a9a9a9">the legal side of the term</font>.
When genocide is formally recognized <font color="#dcdcdc">as a
crime</font>, it is accompanied by a prosecution that begins with the
fact that genocide is not only considered morally outrageous, but can
also be a legal liability in international relations. When genocide
is considered in general terms, it is seen as the <font color="#2f4f4f">deliberate
killing of a particular group</font>. Yet genocide is generally
considered to escape trial and prosecution because <font color="#556b2f">genocide
is most often committed by </font><font color="#6b8e23">officials in
power in a </font><font color="#a0522d">state or region</font>. In

coined, the <font color="#191970">Peace of Westphalia </font>was
concluded to protect <font color="#8b0000">ethnic, national, racial
and, in some cases, religious groups. </font>In the 19th century,

have criticised the exclusion of <font color="#a9a9a9">social and

CPPCG. Hassan Kakar in his book <font color="#dcdcdc">The Soviet

is too narrow and should include <font color="#556b2f">political
groups </font>or any group defined by the perpetrator, quoting Chalk
and Jonassohn: &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Genocide </font>is a form
of unilateral mass killing in which a state or other authority
<font color="#a0522d">intends to destroy a group </font>as defined by
the perpetrator and its membership.&quot; Kakar also argues that the
definition of <font color="#6b8e23">genocide </font>should include
<font color="#556b2f">political groups </font>or any group defined by
the perpetrator. Although there are different definitions of the
term, Adam Jones notes that most genocide scholars believe that
&quot;intent to destroy&quot; is a prerequisite for any act to be
labelled genocide, and that there is growing consensus on the
inclusion of the criterion of physical destruction.</p>

has three different meanings. The usual meaning is that <font color="#a9a9a9">a
government murders </font>people because of their national, ethnic,
racial or <font color="#dcdcdc">religious </font>affiliation. The
legal meaning of genocide refers to an international treaty, the
<font color="#2f4f4f">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
the </font><font color="#556b2f">Crime of Genocide</font>. It also
includes non-murder that ultimately <font color="#6b8e23">eliminates
a group, </font>such as <font color="#a0522d">birth control </font>or
forcibly transferring children from one group to another. The
generalised meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning,
but also includes the killing or otherwise deliberate murder of
political opponents by the government. To avoid confusion about which
meaning is meant, Rummel coined the term democide for the third
meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There has been much debate about the
classification of the <font color="#a9a9a9">situation in Darfur as
</font>genocide. US Secretary of State <font color="#dcdcdc">Colin

2003, a &quot;genocide&quot; in his testimony <font color="#556b2f">to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on </font>9 September 2004.
Since then, however, no other permanent member of the UN Security
Council has done the same. In January 2005, the <font color="#6b8e23">International
Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, </font>mandated by UN Security
Council Resolution 1564 of 2004, submitted a report to the
Secretary-General stating that 'the Government of Sudan has not
pursued a policy of genocide'. However, the Commission warned that
&quot;the conclusion that the government authorities have not pursued
and implemented <font color="#a0522d">a policy of genocide </font>in
Darfur, either directly or through paramilitary forces under their
control, should in no way be taken as an understatement of the
gravity of the crimes committed in the region.&quot; International
crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in
Darfur, can be as serious and heinous as genocide.&quot;</p>

disorder were the starting point for increasing discrimination and

and ideologies that defined the group in question as the enemy. The
historical <font color="#556b2f">devaluation of </font>the victim
<font color="#556b2f">group</font>, the past violence against the
perpetrator group, which causes psychological wounds, authoritarian
cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and
external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the likelihood of
violence developing into genocide. Intense inter-group conflict that
is unresolved, intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The
conditions that lead to genocide provide guidelines for early
prevention, such as <font color="#6b8e23">humanising the disregarded
group</font>, creating ideologies that are inclusive of all groups
and activating bystander reactions. There is a wealth of research on
how to do this, but knowledge is slow to translate into action.</p>

legal and transparent. In October 2010, the OSCE continued to
criticise the Rahmon regime for censorship and repression of the

International assistance was also needed in response to a severe
drought for the second consecutive year, which led to a steady
decline in food production. On <font color="#556b2f">21 August </font>2001,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The success of its football team
made Notre Dame famous. Notre Dame's success reflected the rising
status of Irish-Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics
rallied around the team and listened to games on the radio,
especially as it dropped schools that symbolized America's <font color="#a9a9a9">Protestant
institutions </font>- Harvard, Yale, Princeton and the Army. This
role as a high-profile flagship of Catholicism, however, made it an
easy target for anti-Catholic sentiment. The most notable violence
was the clash between Notre Dame students and the <font color="#dcdcdc">Ku
Klux Klan </font>in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially
against immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and
Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic
Church. The Klan decided to hold a <font color="#2f4f4f">week-long
Klavern event </font><font color="#556b2f">in South Bend.</font>
Clashes with the student union began on 17 March, when students aware
of the anti-Catholic animosity prevented Klansmen from disembarking
from their trains at the South Bend station and tore up KKK clothing
and regalia. On May 19, thousands of students gathered downtown to
demonstrate against Klavern, and only college president <font color="#6b8e23">Fr.
Matthew Walsh's </font>arrival prevented further clashes. The next
day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus event and asked
students to obey the college president and refrain from further
violence. A few days later, Klavern disbanded, but the hostility
shown by the students was an omen and contributed to the fall of the
KKK in Indiana.</p>

arrangement added undergraduate women to a campus that already had
few women graduate students. After extensive debate, the merger with
St. Mary's was rejected, mainly because of faculty disparities in
qualifications and salaries. &quot;In American university education,&quot;

grown considerably since the construction of its oldest buildings.
Over the years, <font color="#a9a9a9">29 </font>dormitories have been
built to accommodate students, each with its own chapel. Many
academic buildings have been added, and a library system has been
established, most notably the <font color="#dcdcdc">Theodore Hesburgh
Library, </font>built in 1963, which now houses <font color="#2f4f4f">nearly
four million </font>books. Since 2004, several buildings have been
added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the
Guglielmino Complex and the Jordan Hall of Science. In addition, a
new men's residence hall, <font color="#556b2f">Duncan Hall, </font>opened
on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the fall 2008
semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate
women in the fall of 2009. Also recently completed were a new
engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combined Center for
Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and
an addition to the Law School. In addition, a new hockey arena opened
in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which
houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education
Department, opened in March 2013 just south of the Mendoza College of
Business building. Due to its long sporting tradition, the university
also has many buildings dedicated to sports. The most famous of these
is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it
has been renovated several times and currently seats over 80 000
people. Other notable venues include the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with
basketball and volleyball rinks, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a

Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. </font>was director of the science museum and

</font>until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its
promise of progress were not incompatible with the ideals of
intellectual and moral culture espoused by the Church. One of
Carrier's students was his father John Augustine Zahm (<font color="#2f4f4f">1851-1921)</font>,
who became professor and co-director of <font color="#556b2f">the
Department of Natural Sciences </font>at the age of 23 and by 1900
was a nationally known scientist and naturalist. Zahm was an active
member of the Catholic summer school movement, which introduced
Catholic laymen to contemporary intellectual issues. His book
<font color="#6b8e23">Evolution and Dogma </font>(1896) defended
certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true and even claimed that
even the great church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught
something of the same. The intervention of Irish American Catholics
in Rome prevented Zahm's censorship by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and
former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition
through the Amazon.</p>

Institute was born out </font>of pioneering research into
germination, which began in <font color="#dcdcdc">1928</font>. This
field of research was inspired by Pasteur's question of whether
animal life was possible without bacteria. Although others had taken
up this idea, their research was short-lived and inconclusive. Lobund
was the first research organisation to definitively answer that such
life was possible and could continue for generations. However, the
aim was not only to answer Pasteur's question, but also to produce a
bacteria-free animal as a new tool for biological and medical
research. This goal was achieved, and for many years Lobund was a
unique centre for the study and production of germ-free animals and
their use in biological and medical research. Today, the work has
spread to other universities. In the beginning, it was under the
Department of Biology, and the research programme was accompanied by
a Master's degree programme. <font color="#2f4f4f">In the 1940s,
</font>Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research
organisation and in <font color="#556b2f">1950 it </font>was elevated
to the status of an institute. In 1958 it was reinstated as an
integral part of the Department of Biology, but with its own
programme leading to a PhD in gnotobiology.</p>

daily and covers mainly university and other news, with a staff of
students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike
Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication
and has neither a faculty advisor nor editorial control by the
university. In 1987, when some students believed The Observer was
becoming conservatively biased, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense,
was published. Similarly, in 2003, when other students believed the
paper to be liberally biased, the conservative newspaper Irish Rover
was launched. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer,
but all three are distributed to all students. In spring 2008, Beyond
Politics, a university magazine on political science research, was

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Notre Dame's conference memberships
for all sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a
result of a major conference realignment, and its fencing membership
will change in July 2014. The Irish moved from the Big East <font color="#a9a9a9">to
the ACC </font>during the prolonged instability of the Big East;
while they retain their independence in football, they are committed
to playing <font color="#dcdcdc">five </font>games per season against
ACC opponents. In hockey, the Irish were forced to search for a new
conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the
sport for the 2013-14 season led to a cascade of conference moves
that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey
home, the <font color="#2f4f4f">Central Collegiate Hockey
</font>Association, after the 2012-13 season. Notre Dame transferred
its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the
conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport
starting in the 2014-15 academic year. There are many theories behind
the introduction of the athletic name, but it is known that the
Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s for the football team
and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his columns for the
New York Daily News. Notre Dame's official colours are <font color="#556b2f">Navy
Blue and Gold Rush</font>, which are used by its sports teams in
competitions. In addition, green is often used for the Fighting Irish
emblem. Notre Dame's <font color="#6b8e23">leprechaun is the </font>mascot
of the sports teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the goblin
was first used in the football pocket program and later on the covers
of the football program. In November 1964, the leprechaun was
featured on the cover of Time magazine and gained national exposure.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">George Gipp
</font>was a legendary footballer at the school from 1916-20. He
played semi-professional baseball and smoked, drank and gambled when
he wasn't playing sports. He was also a humble, generous to those in
need and an honest man. In 1928, famed coach Knute Rockne used his
last conversation with the dying Gipper to inspire the Notre Dame
team to beat <font color="#dcdcdc">the Army team </font>and &quot;win
one for the Gipper.&quot; In the 1940 film Knute Rockne, All
American, <font color="#2f4f4f">Pat O'Brien </font>played Knute
Rockne and Ronald Reagan played <font color="#556b2f">Gipp</font>.
Today, the team competes at Notre Dame Stadium, an <font color="#6b8e23">80,795-seat
</font>stadium on campus. The current head coach is Brian Kelly, who
was hired from the University of Cincinnati on December 11, 2009.
Kelly's record at the halfway point of his sixth season at Notre Dame
is 52-21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish team went undefeated and
played in the BCS national championship game. Kelly succeeded Charlie
Weis, who was fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although
Weis led his team to two Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his
overall record was 35-27, mediocre by Notre Dame standards, and the
2007 team had the most losses in school history. The football team
generates enough revenue to operate independently, while $22.1
million is retained from the team's profits for academic use. Forbes
named the team the most valuable in college football, with a total
value of $101 million in 2007.</p>

would gather material from other disciplines, but would differ from
them in that it would use <font color="#a0522d">comparative anatomy,
physiology and psychology </font>to distinguish man from 'the animals
nearest to him'. He stresses that the comparative data must be

Both the history of <font color="#191970">civilisation </font>and
<font color="#8b0000">ethnology </font>must be included in the

descriptions and the analysis of local phenomena. The shift towards
complex societies meant that political themes began to be addressed
at two main levels. First, anthropologists continued to study
political organisation and political phenomena outside the
state-regulated sphere (such as patron-client relations or tribal
political organisation). Second, anthropologists gradually began to
develop a disciplinary interest in states and their institutions (and
of course in the relationship between formal and informal political
institutions). The anthropology of the state developed and is today a
very flourishing field. <font color="#8b0000">Geertz's </font>comparative
