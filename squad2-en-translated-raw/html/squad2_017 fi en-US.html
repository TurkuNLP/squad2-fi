<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Annelids are double-symmetrical,
three-celled, cocoon-like, invertebrate invertebrates. They also have
<font color="#dcdcdc">parapodia </font>for locomotion. Most textbooks
still use the traditional division into <font color="#2f4f4f">polychaete
worms </font>(almost all marine animals), <font color="#556b2f">oligochaetes
</font>(which include terrestrial worms) and leech-like species.
Cladistic studies since 1997 have radically changed this system, with
leeches being considered a subset of <font color="#6b8e23">oligochaetes
</font>and <font color="#a0522d">oligochaetes </font>a subset of
polychaetes. In addition, Pogonophora, Echiura and Sipuncula,
previously considered as separate tribes, are now considered as a
subgroup of polychaetes. Annelids are considered to belong to the
group Lophotrochozoa, a 'superfamily' of protostomes that also
includes molluscs, brachiopods, flatworms and nemerteans.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The basic shape of annelids consists
of several segments. Each segment has the same organs, and most
polychaetes have a pair of parapodia, which many species use for
locomotion. In many species the segments are distinct, but in others
they are poorly distinguishable or absent, and in <font color="#dcdcdc">Echiura
and Sipuncula </font>there are no obvious signs of segmentation. In
species with well-developed septa, the blood circulates entirely in
blood vessels, and the blood vessels of the segments near the front
end of these species are often built up with muscles that act as
hearts. The septa of such species also allow individual segments to
change shape, facilitating movement by <font color="#556b2f">peristalsis
</font>('waves' running along the body) or undulation, which improves
the efficiency of parapodia. In species where the septa is incomplete
or non-existent, blood circulates through the cavity of the main body
without any kind of pump, and there are a variety of locomotor
techniques - some burrowing species <font color="#6b8e23">turn their
pharynx inside out to pull themselves </font>through the sediment.</p>

are soft-bodied</font>, their fossils are rare - mostly <font color="#dcdcdc">jaws

disagree on whether some of the body fossils from <font color="#a0522d">the

oligochaete remains, with the earliest undisputed fossils of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">No single feature distinguishes
annelids from other invertebrate phyla, but they do have a
distinctive combination of traits. Their bodies are long and their
segments are divided externally <font color="#a9a9a9">by shallow
annular contractions, called annuli, </font>and internally <font color="#dcdcdc">by
septa ('partitions'</font>) at the same points, although in some
species the septa are incomplete and in some cases absent. Most
segments have the same organs, although a <font color="#2f4f4f">common
gut, circulatory system and nervous system </font>make them
interdependent. The arthropod body is covered by a <font color="#556b2f">cuticle
</font>(outer shell), which does not contain cells but is secreted by
cells under the skin, and is made of tough but flexible <font color="#6b8e23">collagen
</font>and does not change - the arthropod cuticle, on the other
hand, is made of the more rigid α-chitin and changes until the
arthropods reach their full size. Most reptiles have a closed

throughout its entire circuit.</p>

while the posterior segment, called the pygidium (<font color="#6b8e23">Greek

peristomium (Greek περι-, meaning &quot;around&quot;, and στομα,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The hair coverings (&quot;hairs&quot;)
of annelids protrude from the epidermis and provide traction and
other properties. The simplest of these are unarticulated and form
paired bundles on either side of each segment. The parapodia
(&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">limbs</font>&quot;) of annelids that
have them often have more complex hairs, such as those that are
articulated, comb-like or hooked. The sheaths are composed of a
moderately flexible β-chitin and are made up of follicles, each with
a ketoblast (&quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">hair-forming</font>&quot;)
cell at the base and muscles that can extend or retract the sheath.
Ketoblasts produce fats by forming <font color="#2f4f4f">microvilli</font>,
fine hair-like projections that increase the area available for fatty
secretion. When the cheta is complete, the microvilli retract into
the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels running almost the entire
length of the cheta. Thus, annelid chetae differ structurally from
arthropod setae ('<font color="#556b2f">bristles</font>'), which are
made of a more rigid α-chitin with a single internal cavity and are
attached to flexible joints in shallow wells in the cuticle.</p>

similar to those of the vertebrate liver: producing and storing

proteins and converting nitrogenous waste products into ammonia and

respiratory pigment - red haemoglobin in some species, green

the main blood vessels and to the parts of the segment that need
oxygen and nutrients. Both main blood vessels, especially the upper
one, can pump blood by contracting. In some annelids, the anterior
end of the upper artery is dilated with muscle to form the heart,
while in many nectarines the anterior end of part of the arteries
connecting the upper and lower main arteries acts as the heart.

mechanisms to perform the first filtration - special filter cells in
the vascular walls of the annelids release fluids and other small
molecules into the chelating fluid, from where they circulate to the
methanephridia. In the annelids, the points where the fluid enters
the protonephridia or the methanephridia are in the anterior part of
the septum, while the second-stage filter and the nephridiopore (an
outlet in the body wall) are in the next segment. Thus, the rearmost
segment (before the growth zone and pygidium) has no structure to
remove the waste because there is no next segment to filter and
remove it, while the first segment has a removal structure that moves
the waste to the second segment but does not contain structures to
filter and remove the urine again.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Because annelids are soft-bodied,
their fossils are rare. The fossil record of multispecies worms
consists mainly of jaws, which some species had, and mineralised
tubes, which some species excreted. Some Ediacaran fossils, such as
Dickinsonia, bear some resemblance to polychaetes, but the
similarities are too vague for these fossils to be reliably
classified. The small shell-shaped fossil Cloudina, dating from
<font color="#a9a9a9">549-542 million years ago</font>, has been
classified as annelid by some authors, but as <font color="#dcdcdc">a
mollusc </font>(i.e. the phylum to which jellyfish and sea anemone
belong) by others. Until 2008, the earliest fossils generally
accepted as annelioids were the multispecies Canadia and
Burgessochaeta, both from the Burgess Shale of Canada, which formed
around <font color="#2f4f4f">505 million years </font>ago <font color="#556b2f">in
the Early Cambrian. </font>The Myoscolex found <font color="#6b8e23">in
Australia</font>, which is slightly older than the Burgess Shale, was
possibly an annelid. However, it lacks some typical annelid features
and has features not normally found in annelids, some of which are
associated with other phyla. Then Simon Conway Morris and John Peel
reported Phragmochaeta from Sirius Passet, which is about 518 million
years old, and concluded that it was the oldest annelid known so far.
There has been heated debate about whether the Burgess Shale fossil
Wiwaxia was a mollusc or an annelid. Multispecies worms
differentiated in the Early Ordovician, around 488-474 million years
ago. The first annelid jaws are found only in the Early Ordovician,
so the crowned group could not have appeared before this time, but
probably a little later. By the end of the Carboniferous, around 299
million years ago, fossils had appeared of most of the modern mobile
multicellular groups. Many of the fossil tubes resemble those
produced by modern sedentary polychaete worms, but the first clearly
polychaete worm-produced tubes date from the Jurassic period, less
than 199 million years ago.</p>

divided into two main groups, the <font color="#a9a9a9">multicellular

considered closely related to annelids, but which were included to
give an indication of where the organisms under study fit into the
wider tree of life. The study used cross-checking analysis of <font color="#2f4f4f">11
</font>genes (including the original 3 genes) in 10 taxa. This
analysis showed that clitellates, pogonophores and echiurans were in
different branches of the polychaete phylogeny. It also concluded
that the classification of the polychaetes <font color="#556b2f">into
Scolecida, Canalipalpata and Aciculata </font>was useless because
members of these putative groups were scattered throughout the
resulting phylogeny of the 81 taxa compared. Furthermore, it placed
the onionculans, then generally regarded as a separate tribe, in the
second branch of the multispecies tree and concluded that the leeches
were a subgroup of the <font color="#6b8e23">oligochaetes </font>rather
than a sister group to them among the clitorids. Rouse accepted
analyses based on molecular phylogenetics, and their main conclusions
are now the scientific consensus, although the details of the annelid

undermine the emphasis of decades of previous writing on the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Annelids belong to <font color="#a9a9a9">the
protostomes</font>, which are one of the two largest superphyla of
amphibians - the other is the <font color="#dcdcdc">deuterostomes</font>,
which includes vertebrates. Protostome annelids were previously
grouped with arthropods in the supergroup Articulata ('<font color="#2f4f4f">arthropods</font>')
because segmentation is evident in most members of both phyla.
However, the genes that control segmentation in arthropods do not
appear to function in the same way in annelids. Both arthropods and
annelids have close relatives that are not segmented. It is at least
as easy to assume that they have evolved to be segmented
independently of each other as it is to assume that the ancestral
protostome or bilateria was segmented and that segmentation
disappeared in many descendant lineages. The current understanding is
that annelids are classified with molluscs, brachiopods and several
other phyla containing lophophores (<font color="#556b2f">fan-shaped
food structures</font>) and/or trochophore larvae in the phylum
Lophotrochozoa. Bryzoa may be the most rudimentary (first to stand
out) genus of Lophotrochozoa, and the relationships between the other
members are not yet known. Arthropods are now considered members of
the Ecdysozoa ('molting animals'), as are some unsegmented tribes.</p>

names are associated with different cultural understandings of God's
identity and attributes. In ancient Egyptian <font color="#a9a9a9">Atheism,
</font>possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, the
deity was called <font color="#dcdcdc">Aten</font>, and was assumed
to be the only 'true' supreme being and creator of the universe. The
Hebrew Bible and Judaism use the words &quot;He who is&quot;, &quot;I
am who I am&quot; and the tetragrammaton <font color="#2f4f4f">YHWH
as </font><font color="#556b2f">names of God</font>, while
Christianity sometimes uses <font color="#6b8e23">Yahweh and Jehovah
</font><font color="#a0522d">as pronunciations of YHWH</font>. In
Christian Trinitarianism, the triune God is called <font color="#191970">Father,
Son and Holy Spirit</font>. In Judaism, God is commonly referred to
as <font color="#8b0000">Elohim or Adonai, the </font>latter of which
some scholars believe to be descended from the Egyptian <font color="#483d8b">Aten.
</font>In Islam, <font color="#3cb371">Allah</font>, &quot;Al-El&quot;

have numerous names for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often regarded

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to theism, God exists
realistically, objectively and independently of human thought, God
created and <font color="#a9a9a9">sustains everything</font>, God is
omnipotent and eternal, and God is personal and interacts with the
universe through, for example, <font color="#dcdcdc">religious
experience and human prayer</font>. According to theism, God is both
transcendent and immanent; that is, God is both infinite and somehow
present in the affairs of the world. Not all theists subscribe to all
of these claims, but everyone tends to subscribe to some of them (see
the genealogy for comparison). According to <font color="#2f4f4f">Catholic
</font>theology, <font color="#556b2f">God is infinitely simple and
not inadvertently subject to time. </font>Most theists believe that

</font>although this belief raises questions <font color="#a0522d">about
God's responsibility for </font><font color="#228b22">evil and
suffering in the world.</font> Some theists attribute God's
omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence to a self-conscious or
deliberate limitation. Open theism, on the other hand, argues that
<font color="#191970">the nature of time means that God's omniscience
does not mean that the deity can predict the future. </font>Sometimes

existence is to <font color="#dcdcdc">worship God. </font>He is

with one that sinned but still asked for repentance. Christian
theologian Alister McGrath writes that there are good reasons to

an integral part of the Christian worldview, but that it <font color="#191970">must

is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and desire to be in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Adherents of different religions
tend to disagree about how best to worship God and what God's plan,
if any, is for humanity. There are different approaches to
reconciling the conflicting claims of monotheistic religions. One
view is that of <font color="#a9a9a9">exclusivists</font>, who
believe they are a chosen people or <font color="#dcdcdc">have
exclusive access to </font><font color="#2f4f4f">absolute truth</font><font color="#dcdcdc">,
usually </font><font color="#556b2f">through revelation or divine
encounter, </font>which adherents of other religions do not. Another
view is religious <font color="#6b8e23">pluralism</font>. A pluralist
typically believes that his or her religion is the correct one, but
does not deny the sub-truths of other religions. In Christianity, an
example of pluralism is <font color="#a0522d">supersessionism</font>,
the belief that one's own religion is the fulfilment of previous
religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where all
are considered equally right; an example is <font color="#228b22">universalism</font>:
the doctrine that <font color="#191970">salvation </font>is
ultimately available to all. The fourth approach is syncretism, which
mixes elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is
the New Age movement.</p>

taking, as <font color="#6b8e23">Richard Swinburne did, </font>an

for the existence of God are convincing, but argue that faith is not
a product of reason, but requires <font color="#a0522d">risk. </font>They
argue that there would be no risk if the arguments for God's
existence were as robust as the laws of logic, a position summed up

Musharraf addressed the Pakistani people and stated that while he

were thriving in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with the tacit
approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence Agency's Inter-Services
Intelligence unit. A team of <font color="#a0522d">Special Air

Kashmir in 2002 to search for <font color="#228b22">Osama bin Laden
after </font>reports that he was being protected by the Kashmiri
militant outfit Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. US authorities believed that
al-Qaeda helped organise a campaign of terror in Kashmir to provoke
conflict between India and Pakistan. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen leader
<font color="#191970">Fazlur Rehman Khalil </font>signed al-Qaeda's
1998 holy war declaration calling on Muslims to attack all Americans
and their allies. Indian sources claimed that in 2006 al-Qaeda
claimed to have established a wing in Kashmir, which worried the
Indian government. India also claimed that al-Qaeda has strong links
with the Pakistani-based <font color="#8b0000">Kashmiri </font>militant
groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. In January 2010, during
a visit to Pakistan, US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates stated that
Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilise the region and was planning to
provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.</p>

Thus an association called the Labour <font color="#2f4f4f">Representation

union-backed MPs and represent working people. It had no single

secretary. He had the difficult task of <font color="#6b8e23">keeping
the various strands of opinion in the LRC united</font>. The 'khaki'
elections of October 1900 were held too soon for the new party to
campaign effectively; the total election expenditure was only £33.
There were only <font color="#a0522d">15 </font>candidates, but two

British governments of the 20th century, implementing Keynesian
economic policies and pursuing a policy of nationalising major
industries and utilities such as the Bank of England, coal mining,
steel, electricity, gas and land transport (including railways, roads
and canals). It developed and implemented the 'cradle to grave'
welfare state as conceived by the economist William Beveridge. To
this day, the party's proudest achievement is the creation of the
publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) in <font color="#dcdcdc">1948
</font>under the leadership of <font color="#2f4f4f">Aneurin Bevan,

dismantle the British Empire by granting independence to India and
Pakistan in <font color="#556b2f">1947</font>, and the following year
to Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). In January 1947, Attlee

centre-left. It was originally set up <font color="#dcdcdc">as a way
for the trade union movement </font>to<font color="#dcdcdc"> gain
political representation </font>in Westminster. It only committed
itself to 'socialism' in the original party constitution in <font color="#2f4f4f">1918</font>.
The strongest supporters saw this 'socialist' element, the original
Clause IV, as a direct commitment to 'co-ownership' or
nationalisation of the 'means of production, distribution and
exchange'. Although about <font color="#556b2f">a third of </font>British
industry was taken into public ownership after the Second World War
and remained so until the 1980s, the party right questioned the
legitimacy of extending this objective in the late 1950s. Influenced
by Anthony Crosland's The Future of Socialism (1956), the circle
around party leader Hugh Gaitskell felt that commitment was no longer
necessary. An attempt to remove Clause IV from the party's
constitution <font color="#6b8e23">in 1959 </font>failed, but Tony
Blair and the 'modernisers' felt that it was a potential voter
turn-off and succeeded 35 years later, with little opposition from

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since regaining independence,
Estonia has seen itself as a <font color="#a9a9a9">gateway between
East and West </font>and has aggressively pursued economic reforms
and integration with the West. Estonia's market reforms have made it
one of the economic leaders of the former COMECON region. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1994,
</font>based on <font color="#2f4f4f">Milton Friedman's </font>economic
theories, Estonia was one of the first countries to introduce a flat
tax at a <font color="#556b2f">uniform rate of 26% </font>regardless
of personal income. In January 2005, the personal income tax rate was
reduced to 24%. In January 2006, the tax rate was reduced again to
23%. In January 2008, the personal income tax rate was reduced to
21%. The Estonian government finalised the design of the Estonian
euro coins at the end of 2004 and introduced the euro on 1 January
2011, later than planned due to continued high inflation. Estonia
levies a land value tax to finance local municipalities. This is a
state-level tax, but 100% of the revenue is used to finance local
councils. The local council sets the tax rate within a range of 0.1%
to 2.5%. It is one of the main sources of funding for local
authorities. The land value tax is levied only on the value of the
land and does not take into account improvements and buildings. There
are very few exemptions from the land value tax and even public
institutions are subject to the tax. The tax has contributed to the
high share of owner-occupied housing in Estonia (~90%) compared to
67.4% in the US.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Karl Popper was born in <font color="#a9a9a9">Vienna
</font>(then Austria-Hungary) in <font color="#dcdcdc">1902 </font>to
upper middle-class parents. All of Karl Popper's grandparents were
Jewish, but the Popper family converted <font color="#2f4f4f">to
Lutheranism </font>before Karl was born, and so he was baptised as a
Lutheran. They understood this as part of cultural assimilation, not
as an expression of devout faith. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl
Popper was a Bohemian <font color="#556b2f">lawyer </font>and doctor
of law at the University of Vienna, and his mother Jenny Schiff was
of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After settling in Vienna, the
Poppers made a rapid social rise in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund
Carl became a partner in the law firm of <font color="#6b8e23">Herr
</font><font color="#a0522d">Grübl, the </font>liberal <font color="#6b8e23">mayor
of </font>Vienna, and after Grübl's death in 1898, Simon took over
the firm. (Malachi Hacohen writes that Herr Grübl's first name was
Raimund, after which Karl took his middle name. Popper himself, in
his autobiography, incorrectly recalls that Herr Grübl's first name
was Carl). His father was a <font color="#228b22">bibliophile whose
</font>personal library contained between <font color="#191970">12
000 and 14 000 </font>volumes. Popper inherited both the library and
the disposition from him.</p>

in the sense that it </font>was possible to deduce consequences that

</font>to conclude that what he considered to be the major strengths

Psychoanalytic theories were designed in such a way that they were
able to refute all criticism and provide an explanation for all
possible forms of human behaviour. The very nature of such theories
made it impossible for any <font color="#2f4f4f">criticism or
experiment </font>- even in principle - to disprove them. This
insight had an important consequence when <font color="#556b2f">Popper
</font>later dealt with the problem of the demarcation of the

of a scientific theory lies in the fact <font color="#6b8e23">that </font>it

results at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific
theory, but a single counterfactual is logically decisive: it
disproves the theory from which the implication is derived. To say
that a particular statement (e.g., a legal statement of some
scientific theory) - [call it &quot;T&quot;] - is &quot;falsifiable&quot;
does not mean that &quot;T&quot; is false. Rather, it means that if
&quot;T&quot; is false, then (in principle) &quot;T&quot; can be
disproved by observation or experiment. Popper's explanation of the

manifested in the materials of the first world (i.e. <font color="#a0522d">books</font>,

and as such has an existence and development independent of
individual knowing subjects. The influence of the third world on the

powerful as that of the first world. In other words, the knowledge
possessed by a particular individual mind owes at least as much to
the accumulated and embodied total richness of human knowledge as it
does to the world of immediate experience. As such, the growth of
human knowledge can be said to depend on the independent development
of <font color="#191970">the Third </font>World. Many contemporary

trying to find new ways of life and trying to conquer new ecological
niches) and naturalistic '<font color="#191970">evolution from

Popper's <font color="#2f4f4f">falsificationism can be questioned

statement such as &quot;for every metal there is a temperature at
which it melts&quot;. The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any

tested at which a <font color="#556b2f">metal </font>can actually
melt, but it still seems a valid scientific hypothesis. <font color="#6b8e23">Carl

answer to this is that, since Popper describes how theories gain,
maintain and lose scientific status, the individual consequences of
currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense
that they are part of preliminary scientific knowledge, and both of
Hempel's examples fall into this category. For example, <font color="#191970">atomic

but four are common: the <font color="#dcdcdc">round-bottomed
mandolin, the carved mandolin and the flat-bottomed mandolin</font><font color="#a9a9a9">.
The </font><font color="#2f4f4f">round-backed </font>mandolin has a
deep base made of <font color="#556b2f">wooden strips glued together.
</font><font color="#6b8e23">The carved top mandolin </font>has a
much shallower, curved back and curved top, both carved from wood<font color="#6b8e23">.</font>
The flat-backed mandolin has a body made of thin sheets of wood,
reinforced on the inside like a guitar. Each instrument has its own
sound quality and is associated with a particular type of music.
Naples mandolins <font color="#228b22">play</font> a central role in

</font><font color="#191970">Carved instruments </font>are common in

Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish, British and
Brazilian folk music. Some modern Brazilian instruments have an extra
fifth chord tuned below the usual fourth chord.</p>

which are </font>subjected to more pressure than the intestinal
strings. The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure
of the metal strings, which would break the earlier instruments.
There are many types of soundboard, but <font color="#8b0000">usually
round or teardrop-shaped</font>, and sometimes with scrolls or other
protrusions. The soundboard usually has one or more sound holes,
either round, oval or in the shape of a calligraphic letter F
(f-hole). The circular or oval sound hole may be covered or <font color="#483d8b">bordered
with </font><font color="#3cb371">decorative rosettes or urns.</font></p>

from mandolin to mandolin </font>began around <font color="#dcdcdc">1744</font>,
when the Vinaccia family designed a metal-stringed mandolin with
three brass strings and one gut string, using friction tuning pegs
with a keyboard flush with the soundboard. The mandolin's popularity
grew over the next 60 years in the <font color="#2f4f4f">streets,

The 19th century saw the emergence of some notable players, such as
<font color="#228b22">Bartolomeo Bortolazzi from Venice and Pietro
Vimercati.</font> However, professional virtuosity was in decline and
mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument; 'the
mandolin and the mandolin's extensive repertoire of notated
instrumental music was completely forgotten'. The <font color="#191970">export
market for mandolins </font>from Italy dried up around <font color="#8b0000">1815</font>,
and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote <font color="#483d8b">the

mandolin was &quot;obsolete&quot;. Salvador Léonardi mentioned this
decline in his 1921 book <font color="#3cb371">Méthode pour

repertoire is almost limitless, and musicians play a wide variety of
music on it. This is particularly true for violin music, as the
mandolin has the same tuning as <font color="#dcdcdc">the violin</font>.
After its invention and early development in Italy, the mandolin
spread throughout the European continent. The instrument was mainly
used <font color="#2f4f4f">in the classical tradition, and </font>many
cities had <font color="#2f4f4f">mandolin orchestras</font>, the
so-called Estudiantinas or Zupforchestern in Germany. After the
continental popularity of the mandolin family, local traditions
appeared outside Europe in America and Japan. Itinerant mandolin
virtuosos such as <font color="#556b2f">Giuseppe Pettinen, Raffaele
Calace and Silvio Ranieri </font>contributed to the mandolin becoming
a fashionable instrument in <font color="#6b8e23">the early 20th
century</font>. This 'mandolin revival' was fading by the <font color="#a0522d">1930s</font>,
but just as the mandolin was falling into disuse, the mandolin found
a new niche in American country, old-time, bluegrass and folk music.
More recently, the repertoire and styles of the baroque and classical
mandolin have benefited from increased awareness and interest in
early music, with the media drawing attention to classical musicians
such as Israeli Avi Avital, Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The mandolin has been widely used in
traditional music in England and Scotland for generations. <font color="#a9a9a9">Simon
Mayor is a </font>prominent British player who has produced <font color="#dcdcdc">six
solo albums</font><font color="#2f4f4f">, instructional books and
DVDs, as well as recordings with the mandolin quartet Mandolinquents.</font>
The instrument has also found its way into British rock music. <font color="#556b2f">Mike
Oldfield </font>played the mandolin (and Vivian Stanshall performed
it) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells and on several of his later
albums (notably Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was
widely used by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, whose two
members, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, played the instrument and whose
<font color="#6b8e23">'</font><font color="#a0522d">Fog on the Tyne</font>'
was the best-selling album in the UK from 1971 to 1972. The
instrument was also widely used in the British folk heroes of the
1960s and 1970s, with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye
Span adopting it as the main instrument in many of their songs.
Jackson's playing was also featured on Rod Stewart's <font color="#228b22">Maggie
May, which </font>went to number one in the UK and number one on the
Billboard Hot 100. It has also been used by other British rock
musicians. Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished
mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin,
including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part
of The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the
song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin include Hey Hey
What Can I Do and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of The Who
played mandolin on Mike Post Theme and on many other songs on Endless
Wire. Another example is McGuinness Flint, whose most successful
single When I'm Dead And Gone featured Graham Lyle on mandolin. Lyle
was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance and played
mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the earliest mandolin players
in popular music was Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band.
Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson is a very skilled mandolin player
(beautiful song Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The
Smiths' popular song Please Please Please Please Please Let Me Get
What I Want featured a mandolin solo by Johnny Marr. More recently,
the Glasgow band Sons and Daughters featured Ailidh Lennon on
mandolin on songs such as Fight, Start to End and Medicine. British
folk-punk icon Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their
songs. Contemporary bands have also started to use the mandolin and
its unique sound - such as Indigo Moss from South London, who use it
on all their recordings and live shows. The mandolin has also
featured in the playing of rock band Muse's Matthew Bellamy. It also
forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit &quot;Dance Tonight&quot;.
However, it was not the first time the Beatle played the mandolin;
that honour goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title track
from the 1982 album of the same name. In Lanarkshire, the Lanarkshire
Guitar and Mandolin Association teaches mandolin playing to over 100
people. More recently, hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures
have also played a song based mainly on the mandolin. This song was
omitted from their debut album and features former Led Zeppelin
bassist John Paul Jones[citation needed].</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The popularity of the mandolin in
the United States was boosted by the success of a touring group of
young European musicians known as <font color="#a9a9a9">Estudiantina
Figaro</font>, or simply &quot;Spanish Students&quot; in the United
States. The group landed in New York on <font color="#dcdcdc">2
January 1880 </font>and played to wildly enthusiastic audiences <font color="#2f4f4f">in
Boston and New York.</font> Ironically, this band did not play
mandolins but bandurrios, which are also small, mandolin-like,
two-stringed instruments. The success of Figaro's Spanish students
spawned other groups that imitated their musical style and costumes.
Italian musician Carlo Curti hastily formed a musical group after
seeing Figaro's Spanish students perform; his group of Italian-born
Americans called themselves the '<font color="#556b2f">original
Spanish students'</font>, confident that American audiences would not
know the <font color="#a0522d">difference between Spanish bandurrias
and Italian mandolins</font>. The imitators' use of mandolins helped
to create enormous public interest in an instrument that was
previously relatively unknown in the United States.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The mandolin's popularity in the
United States blossomed <font color="#a9a9a9">in the 1880s</font>,
when the instrument became part of a craze that continued until the
mid-1920s<font color="#a9a9a9">. </font>Clarence L. Partee reports

Partee described the early instrument as larger than the European
instruments to which he was accustomed, with a &quot;peculiar&quot;
shape and &quot;coarse&quot; texture, and said the quality improved
until American instruments were &quot;superior&quot; to imported
ones. At the time, Partee was using an<font color="#a0522d"> imported

the teacher-traders, however, were serious musicians who sought to
carve out a place for the instrument in classical music, ragtime and
jazz. Like the teacher-traders, they travelled around the United

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">While <font color="#a9a9a9">Cowan
Powers and his family </font>recorded old-time music between <font color="#dcdcdc">1924
and 1926</font>, his daughter <font color="#2f4f4f">Orpha Powers was
one of the </font>earliest known Southern music artists to record
with a mandolin. As the 1930s approached, <font color="#556b2f">individual
mandolins </font>were increasingly used in Southern string band
music, especially by brother duos such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys
(Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick) and the harder-edged Monroe Brothers
(Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe). However, the mandolin's modern
popularity in country music is directly attributable to one man: <font color="#6b8e23">Bill
Monroe</font>, the father of bluegrass music. After the Monroe
brothers broke up in 1939, <font color="#a0522d">Bill Monroe </font>formed
his own band, briefly known as the <font color="#228b22">Blue Grass
Boys, </font>and completed the transition of mandolin styles from the
&quot;parlor sound&quot; typical of the brothers' duets to the modern
&quot;bluegrass&quot; style. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939,
and its powerful bright-channel broadcast on WSM-AM spread his style
throughout the South and directly inspired many musicians to take up
the mandolin. Monroe famously played a Gibson F-5 mandolin, signed
and dated July 9, 1923 by Gibson's chief acoustical engineer Lloyd
Loar, which has since been emulated most sonically and aesthetically
by modern builders.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Monroe's style included playing lead
melodies in the style of a violinist and also a percussive chord
sound called &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">chop</font>&quot; because of
the sound made by the rapidly struck and muted strings. He also
perfected a sparse, percussive blues style, especially above the neck
on keys that had not been used much in country music, especially <font color="#dcdcdc">in
B-flat and E-flat.</font> He emphasized a strong, syncopated right
hand at the expense of left-hand virtuosity. The second generation of
Monroe's most influential successors are <font color="#2f4f4f">Frank
Wakefield </font>and, today, Mike Compton and David Long of the
Nashville Bluegrass Band, who often tour as a duo. Tiny <font color="#556b2f">Moore

electric guitar, bass and drums, the band uses a number of

these instruments accentuate the growling sound they prefer. The 1991

of the states of Sucre, Nueva Esparta, Anzoategui and Monagas, the
mandolin has been made the main instrument in the Joropo, Puntos,
Jotas, Polos, Fulias, Merengues and Malagueñas. In the west of the
country, the mandolin sound is also closely linked to the <font color="#dcdcdc">regional
genres of the Venezuelan Andes</font>: bambucos, pasillos, pasodobles
and waltzes. In the western city of Maracaibo, the mandolin has been
played in Decimas, Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas, and in the
capital Caracas, Merengue Rucaneao, Pasodobles and Waltzes have also
been played on the mandolin for almost a century. Today, Venezuelan

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">To fill this gap in the literature,
<font color="#a9a9a9">mandolin orchestras have traditionally played
many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other
ensembles</font>. Some players have sought out contemporary composers
to acquire new works. Traditional mandolin orchestras are still
particularly popular <font color="#dcdcdc">in Japan and Germany, </font>but
they also exist throughout the United States, Europe and other parts
of the world. They perform works composed for the mandolin family
instruments or rearrangements of traditional pieces. The structure of
a modern traditional mandolin orchestra consists of the following
instruments: <font color="#2f4f4f">first and second mandolins</font><font color="#556b2f">,
</font>mandolins (either octave mandolins tuned an octave lower than
the mandolin or tenor mandolins tuned like a viola), mandolins (tuned
like a <font color="#6b8e23">cello</font>) and bass instruments (a
conventional string bass or, rarely, mando basses). Smaller
configurations, such as quartets of <font color="#a0522d">two

more than 90% of the Earth's diverse animal species. Insects are

Entognath clades have an evolutionary history distinct from insects.
Many traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be
paraphyletic, so instead of using classifications such as subclasses,
superclasses and subclasses, it has proved preferable to use
monophyletic groupings (where the last common ancestor is a member of

lay eggs, receive and store sperm, process sperm from different males
and lay eggs. The accessory glands or glandular parts of the
fallopian tubes produce various substances for sperm maintenance,
transport and fertilisation, as well as for egg protection. They can
produce glue and protective substances to coat the eggs, or hard
coatings for the batch of eggs, called ootheca. Spermathecae are

Unlike the eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought
resistant. This is because two additional membranes, the amnion and
the serosa, develop from embryonic tissue inside the chorion. The
serosa secretes a chitin-rich cuticle that protects the embryo from
desiccation. In Schizophora, however, the serosa does not develop;
these flies lay their eggs in moist places, such as rotting matter.
Some insect species, such as the cockroach Blaptica dubia and
juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are oviparous. The eggs of
ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female and hatch
immediately after laying. Some other species, such as those of the
cockroach genus Diploptera, are viable, i.e. they develop inside the
mother and are born alive.:129, 131, 134-135 Some insects, such as
parasitic wasps, have polygyny, in which a single fertilised egg cell

grows and eventually turns into a pupa, a stage characterised by
reduced locomotion and often enclosed in a cocoon. There are three
types of cocoon: obtect, exarate and coarctate. Obtect-tupes are
compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. The legs and

oscillate at 10.6 ± 2.1 Hz (n=190). These waving movements can
signal the arrival of new material in the nest, and aggression
between workers can be used to encourage other workers to increase
foraging trips. There is a clear tendency to trade-off between visual
acuity and chemical or tactile sensation, such that most insects with
well-developed eyes have smaller or simpler antennae, and vice versa.
There are several different mechanisms by which insects detect sound,
and although the patterns are not universal, insects can generally
hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have
varying degrees of hearing, although most insects can only hear a
narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds
they produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear frequencies as low
as 2 kHz, and some crickets can hear frequencies as high as 50 kHz.
Certain predators and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic
sounds produced by their prey or host. For example, some nocturnal
moths can detect ultrasonic emissions from bats, which helps them
avoid predation.87-94 Blood-dwelling insects have special sensory
structures that can detect infrared radiation and use it to locate

the earliest organisms to produce and sense <font color="#dcdcdc">sounds</font>.
Insects produce sounds mainly <font color="#2f4f4f">mechanically </font>by
means of <font color="#556b2f">accessory organs</font>. In
grasshoppers and crickets, this is done by stridulation. Crickets
produce the loudest sounds of all insects by producing and amplifying
sounds through specific modifications to their bodies and
musculature. The sound of the African crane swordfish Brevisana
brevis has been measured at 106.7 decibels at a distance of 50 cm.
Some insects, such as Helicoverpa beetles, hawk moths and Hedylid
butterflies, can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they
detect bats spotting them. Some moths produce <font color="#6b8e23">ultrasonic
</font>clicks that were once thought to interfere with bat sonar. It
was later discovered that the ultrasonic clicks were mainly produced
by unpleasant moths to warn bats, just as warning colours are used
against predators that prey on the sense of sight. Some otherwise
tasty moths have evolved to mimic these sounds. Recently, the
argument that some moths can interfere with the echolocation of bats
has been revisited. Ultrasound recordings of bat-moth interactions
and high-speed infrared video recordings suggest that the tasty tiger
butterfly actually defends itself against attacking big brown bats by
using ultrasonic clicks to disrupt bat echolocation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Insects are the only group of
invertebrates to have evolved <font color="#a9a9a9">flight</font>.
The evolution of insect <font color="#dcdcdc">wings </font>has been
debated. Some entomologists propose that wings originate from
paranotal lobes, extensions of the insect's exoskeleton called nota,
a <font color="#2f4f4f">theory </font>known as <font color="#2f4f4f">the

originate from modified gills, a spinneret or an epicoxa appendage.
Epicoxa theory suggests that insect wings are modified <font color="#6b8e23">epicoxa
explants</font>, modified appendages at the base of the legs or coxa.
In the Carboniferous period, some Meganeura dragonflies had wingspans
up to 50 cm (20 inches) wide. The presence of giant insects has been
found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen levels. Insects
are limited in size by their respiratory systems, but high
atmospheric oxygen levels allowed for larger sizes. Today, the
largest flying insects are much smaller, and include several species
of butterflies such as the atlas butterfly and the white witch
(Thysania agrippina).</p>

extensively studied in cockroaches. The legs are used alternately in
a triangle that touches the ground. On the first step, the middle
right leg and the front and back left legs are in contact with the
ground and move the insect forward, while the front and back right
legs and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new

the other legs can be lifted and moved forward in turn, and so on.
The purest form of tripod walking can be seen in insects moving at
high speed. However, this form of locomotion is not rigid and insects
can adapt to <font color="#556b2f">different </font>walking patterns.
For example, when moving slowly, turning or dodging obstacles, four

some of these species, carving or differently coloured scales or
hairs make the beetle resemble <font color="#6b8e23">bird droppings
</font>or other inedible objects. Many species that live in sandy
environments blend in with the colour of the substrate. Most phasmids
are known to effectively mimic the shapes of sticks and leaves, and
some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) have mossy
or lichen-like projections covering their bodies to complement their
camouflage. Some species have the ability to change colour in
response to changes in their environment (B. scabrinota, T.
californica). In addition, several species have been observed to
complement cryptic behaviour with a rocking movement of the body from
side to side, which is thought to mirror the movement of leaves or
branches swaying in the wind. Another way in which stinging insects
avoid predation and resemble branches is by feigning death
(catalepsy), whereby the insect enters a motionless state that it can
maintain for a long period of time. The nocturnal feeding habits of
adult individuals also help Phasmatodea to remain hidden from
predators.</p>

insects are the </font>most popular, many insects are <font color="#dcdcdc">beneficial
</font>to the environment and to humans. Some insects, such as wasps,
bees, butterflies and ants, <font color="#2f4f4f">pollinate </font>flowering
plants. Pollination is a reciprocal relationship between plants and
insects. When insects gather <font color="#556b2f">nectar </font>from
different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from
plants they have previously eaten. This greatly increases the ability
of plants to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even
improves their evolutionary fitness. Ultimately, this has
implications for humans, as ensuring healthy crops is crucial for
agriculture. In addition to pollination, ants help to spread plant
seeds. This helps in plant dispersal, which increases plant
diversity. This leads to a better environment overall. A <font color="#6b8e23">serious
</font>environmental problem is the decline in pollinator insect
populations, and today several species of insects are cultivated
primarily for pollination control to provide sufficient pollinators
in the field, orchard, or greenhouse during the flowering
season:240-243 Another solution, as in Delaware, has been the
cultivation of native plants to support native pollinators such as L.
viereck. The insects also produce useful substances such as honey,
wax, varnish and silk. Humans have been cultivating honey bees for
thousands of years for honey, although for beekeepers, crop
pollination is becoming increasingly important. The silkworm has had
a major impact on human history, as the silk trade has forged links
between China and the rest of the world.</p>

<font color="#a9a9a9">during the scientific revolution, which
</font>introduced and prioritised the study of the natural sciences,

which established political relations between Europeans and peoples
with different cultural and political traditions. As <font color="#2f4f4f">Europeans
</font>encountered people from different parts of the world, they
speculated about the physical, social and cultural differences
between different groups of people. The rise of the Atlantic slave
trade, which gradually supplanted the earlier trade in slaves from
all over the world, created an additional incentive to classify
groups of people in order to justify the subjugation of<font color="#556b2f">
African slaves</font>. Drawing on classical sources and their own
internal interactions - the hostility between English and Irish, for
example, strongly influenced early European thinking about human
differences - Europeans began to sort themselves and others into
groups based on physical appearance and to attribute to individuals
in these groups patterns of behaviour and abilities that were said to
be deeply ingrained. A set of folk beliefs emerged that linked
inherited physical differences between groups to inherited
intellectual, behavioural and moral characteristics. Similar ideas
can be found in other cultures, such as China, where the concept,
often translated as 'race', was associated with a supposed common
descent from the Yellow Emperor and was used to emphasise the unity
of ethnic groups in China. There have been bitter conflicts between

</font>often abbreviated FST. This statistic is often used in
taxonomy to compare differences between two populations by measuring
genetic differences between and among populations for single genes or
multiple genes simultaneously. It is often said that the human
fixation index is around <font color="#2f4f4f">0.15</font>. This
means that an estimated 85% of the variation measured in the whole
human population occurs within individuals in the same population and
about 15% of the variation occurs between populations. These
estimates imply that two individuals from different populations are
almost as likely to be more similar to each other than either of the
members of their own group. Richard Lewontin, who established these
ratios, thus concluded that &quot;race&quot; or &quot;subspecies&quot;
are not appropriate or useful ways to describe <font color="#556b2f">human

and Rick Kittles </font>criticized the application of FST to human
populations at length in their 2003 article &quot;Human Genetic
Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races&quot;. They argue
that the 85% figure is <font color="#dcdcdc">misleading </font>because
it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all
genetic diversity. They argue that this figure does not accurately
reflect the history of human populations because it treats all human
groups as independent. A more realistic picture of the relationships
of human groups is to understand that some groups of people are
parents of other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic
groups relative to their lineage groups. For example, the recent
theory of African origins holds that the African human population is
paraphyletic with respect to all other human groups because it
represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations
originated, but moreover, non-African groups are derived from only a
small<font color="#2f4f4f">, non-representative </font>sample of this
African population. This means that all non-African groups are more
closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably
East African) than to others, and that migration out of Africa
represented a <font color="#556b2f">genetic </font>bottleneck, so
that much of the diversity that was in Africa did not move out of
Africa with the migrating groups. This view produces a version of
human population movement that does not result in all human
populations being independent, but rather in diversity becoming
diluted the further away from Africa a population lives, and that
each founding event represents a genetic subset of its parent
population. Long and Kittles find that instead of 85% of human
genetic diversity being in all human populations, about <font color="#6b8e23">100%
of </font>human diversity is in a single African population, while
only about 70% of human genetic diversity is in a population
originating in New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still
leads to the conclusion that the global human population is
genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations.</p>

They found that several <font color="#dcdcdc">thousand </font>genetic
markers had to be used to answer the question &quot;How often is a
pair of individuals from one population genetically more different
than two individuals selected from two different populations?&quot;
would be &quot;never&quot;. Three population groups, geographically
very far apart (European, African and East Asian populations) were
assumed. The world population as a whole is much more complex, and
studying more and more groups would require more and more <font color="#2f4f4f">markers
</font>to get the same answer. The authors conclude that &quot;<font color="#556b2f">caution
</font>should be exercised when using geographical or genetic
ancestry to draw conclusions about individual phenotypes&quot;.
Witherspoon et al. conclude that &quot;the fact that sufficient
genetic data allow individuals to be correctly assigned to their
populations of origin is consistent with the finding that most human
genetic variation occurs within populations, not between them. It is
also compatible with our ﬁnding that even when looking at the most
discrete populations and using hundreds of loci, individuals are
often more similar to members of <font color="#6b8e23">other
populations </font>than to members of their own population. &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Anthropologists such as C. Loring
Brace, philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and
geneticist Joseph Graves have argued that while biological and
genetic variation roughly corresponding to the groupings usually
defined as &quot;continental races&quot; can certainly be found, this
is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The
cluster structure of genetic data is therefore dependent on the
researcher's initial <font color="#a9a9a9">hypotheses </font>and the
populations sampled. When continental groups are sampled, the
clusters become <font color="#dcdcdc">continental</font>; if other
sampling methods had been chosen, the cluster structure would be
different. Weiss and Fullerton have found that if only Icelandic,
Maya and Maori were sampled, three separate clusters would be formed,
and all other populations could be described as consisting of a
mixture of clinically Maori, Icelandic and Maya genetic material.
Indeed, Kaplan and Winther argue that, viewed in this way, both
Lewontin and Edwards are correct in their assertions. They conclude
that although racial groups are characterised by different allele
frequencies, this does not mean that <font color="#2f4f4f">racial
classification </font>is a natural taxonomy of the human species,
because many other genetic patterns may exist in human populations
that transcend racial distinctions. Furthermore, genomic data do not
determine whether one wants to see subdivisions (i.e. splitters) or
continuum (i.e. lumpers). In Kaplan and Winther's view, <font color="#556b2f">racial
categories </font>are objective social constructs (see Mills 1998 )
that have conventional biological reality only insofar as categories
are selected and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In his
earlier work, Winther had defined 'diversity stratification' and
'cluster analysis' as two distinct <font color="#6b8e23">methods with
</font>different questions, assumptions and protocols. Both also have
opposite ontological implications with respect to the metaphysics of
race.</p>

Americans have been classified as belonging to different races.
Efforts to track the mixing between groups led to the <font color="#dcdcdc">increasing
use of categories </font>such as mulatto and octagon. The criteria
for membership of these races diverged in <font color="#2f4f4f">the
late 19th century</font>. During <font color="#556b2f">Reconstruction</font>,
an increasing number of Americans began to consider as black anyone
with &quot;one drop&quot; of known &quot;black blood&quot;,
regardless of appearance.3 By the early 1900s, this concept had been
codified into law in many states.4 Indians were still defined by a
percentage of &quot;Indian blood&quot; (the so-called blood quantum).
To be white, a person had to be of &quot;pure&quot; white ancestry.
The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention that a
person is defined as racially black if he or she has known African
ancestry. This rule meant that mixed-race persons with identifiable
African ancestry were defined as black. The <font color="#6b8e23">one-drop
rule </font>applies not only to persons of African ancestry but also
to the United States, making it a particularly African American
experience.</p>

follow geographical boundaries that often coincide with climatic
zones. This is not surprising, since the <font color="#2f4f4f">selective

have shaped the human race not only in skin colour and hair shape but
also in the bony structures of the nose, cheekbones, etc. (For
example, protruding noses moisten the air better.)&quot; While he
sees good arguments for both sides, the complete denial of contrary
evidence &quot;seems to be largely driven by <font color="#556b2f">socio-political

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since 2010, criminal justice
agencies in England and Wales have used <font color="#a9a9a9">at
least two </font>separate racial or ethnic classification systems for
criminal reports. One is the system used in <font color="#dcdcdc">the
2001 Census</font>, where people declare their ethnicity: W1 (white
British), W2 (white Irish), W9 (other white background); M1 (white
and black Caribbean), M2 (white and black African), M3 (white and
Asian), M9 (other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2
(Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Other Asian); B1
(Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Other Black); O1
(Chinese), O9 (Other). Others are categories used by the police when

or South East Asian (IC5), Middle Eastern (IC6) and unknown (IC0).
&quot;IC&quot; stands for &quot;<font color="#556b2f">Identification

classifications. Officials are instructed to &quot;record the answer
given&quot;, even if the person gives an answer that may be
incorrect; their own understanding of the person's ethnic background
is recorded separately. In September 2007, the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) questioned the comparability of data recorded by

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Most French rulers since the Middle
Ages have sought to leave their mark on a city that has never been
destroyed by disaster or war, unlike many other world capitals. In
modernising its infrastructure over the centuries, Paris has even
preserved its earliest history on its street map. The city was
originally formed, before the Middle Ages, around a series of islands
and sandy beaches on the bend of the Seine, two of which remain
today: <font color="#a9a9a9">the island of Saint-Louis and the island
of the Cité</font>; the third is the île aux Cygnes, artificially
created <font color="#dcdcdc">in 1827. </font>Modern Paris owes much
to <font color="#2f4f4f">Baron Haussmann's </font>renewal of the
second Empire style at the end of the 19th century: many of the
busiest streets, avenues and boulevards in Paris today are the result
of this urban renewal. The Parisian style is also characterised by
its linear street facades, the creamy grey 'Paris stone' of its
buildings, the linear top-floor balconies and tree-lined boulevards.
The city centre's large population makes it much more different from
most other western cities of the world.</p>

Parisian town planning legislation has been strictly enforced,
particularly with regard to the alignment of streets, the height of
buildings and the distribution of buildings. In a recent development,
the building height limit of 37 metres (121 feet) from 1974 to 2010
was raised to <font color="#a9a9a9">50 metres </font>(160 feet) in
central areas and 180 metres (590 feet) in some of Paris' outlying
districts, but in some of the city's most central districts, even
older building height regulations remain in force. <font color="#dcdcdc">Montparnasse's
</font>210-metre tower was the tallest building in both Paris and
France until 1973, but this record has been held by the Tour First
tower in the La Défense district of Courbevoie since its

Paris date back more than a millennium, such as the Romanesque church

Gothic architecture of the basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), Notre Dame
Cathedral (1163-1345), the magnificent Gothic church of Saint
Chapelle (1239-1248) and the Baroque churches of
Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627-1641) and Les Invalides (1670-1708). The

church (<font color="#a9a9a9">1808-1842)</font>, the Palais Garnier
opera house (<font color="#dcdcdc">1875)</font>, the neo-Byzantine

Department of Seine had administered Paris and its suburbs since its

Many other suburban residential areas (grands ensembles) were built
in the 1960s and 1970s to provide affordable solutions for a rapidly
growing population: these areas were initially socially mixed, but
few residents owned their homes (the growing economy made it possible
to build these areas for the middle class only from the 1970s
onwards). Their poor construction quality and haphazard placement in
the existing urban fabric contributed to their abandonment by those
who could move elsewhere and to their repopulation by people with

artists from all over the world, who come to the city to train and
find inspiration in its wide range of artistic resources and
galleries. As a result, Paris has gained a reputation as the 'city of
art'. Italian artists made a major contribution to the development of
Parisian art in the 1500s and 1600s, particularly in the field of
<font color="#a9a9a9">sculpture and reliefs.</font> Painting and
sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy, and many Parisian
artists were commissioned by French royalty to decorate their palaces
during the French Baroque and Classical periods. Sculptors such as
Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou became renowned as the best artists of
the 17th century French royal court. <font color="#dcdcdc">Pierre
Mignard </font>became King Louis XIV's first painter in this period.
In <font color="#2f4f4f">1648, the </font>Académie royale de
peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture)
<font color="#2f4f4f">was founded </font>to respond to the capital's
dramatic artistic boom. The Academy was the highest art school in
France until <font color="#556b2f">1793.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Paris was in its artistic heyday in
the 19th and early 20th centuries, with the establishment of an
artists' colony in the city and its art schools, in contact with some
of the greatest painters of the time: Manet, Monet, Berthe Morisot,
Gauguin, Renoir and others. The French Revolution and the political
and social changes in France had a profound impact on the art of the
capital. Paris played a key role in the development of <font color="#a9a9a9">Romanticism
</font>in art, with artists such as Gericault. Impressionism, Art
Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all
developed in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists from the
French provinces and the rest of the world came to Paris to exhibit
their work in numerous salons and exhibitions and to make a name for
themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van
Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau,
Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others joined Paris.
Picasso, who lived in <font color="#dcdcdc">Montmartre, </font>painted
his famous works La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles
d'Avignon between <font color="#2f4f4f">1905 and 1907. </font><font color="#556b2f">Montmartre

Niépce </font>made the first permanent photograph on a polished tin
plate in Paris in <font color="#dcdcdc">1825 </font>and then
developed the process with Louis Daguerre. Étienne-Jules Marey's
work in the 1880s had a major impact on the development of modern
photography. Photography played a central role in the surrealist
movement in Paris, in the work of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Many
photographers became famous for their Parisian photography, such as
Eugène Atget, famous for <font color="#2f4f4f">his street
photography</font>, Robert Doisneau, famous for his playful images of
people and markets (of which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has
become an icon of the romantic vision of Paris), <font color="#556b2f">Marcel
Bovis</font>, famous for his night photography, and others such as
Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an

century </font>with the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules
Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges

restaurant in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period. Famous
19th century Parisian restaurants such as Café de Paris, Rocher de
Cancale, Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and Café Riche were mostly
located near the <font color="#556b2f">theatres </font>on the
Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of
Balzac and Émile Zola. Several of Paris' most famous restaurants of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In addition to the classic
restaurants, Paris has many other traditional places to eat. The café
arrived in Paris in the <font color="#a9a9a9">17th century, </font>when
the drink was first imported from Turkey, and in the 1700s Parisian
cafés were the centres of the city's political and cultural life.
The <font color="#dcdcdc">Cafe Procope on </font>the left bank dates
from this period. The cafés on the Left Bank, notably the Café de
la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and the Café de Flore
and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in
operation, were important meeting places for painters, writers and
philosophers in the 20th century. <font color="#2f4f4f">A bistro is a
</font>type of eatery, roughly defined as a neighbourhood restaurant,
with modest decor and prices, regular customers and a friendly
atmosphere. The bistro was named in 1814 by the Russian soldiers who
occupied the town, who wanted to get their meals quickly so they
could get back to their camp. Real bistros are increasingly rare in
Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic
restaurants and the different eating habits of Parisians. The
brasserie was originally a tavern next to a brewery, serving beer and
food at all hours. From <font color="#556b2f">the 1867 Paris World
Fair </font>onwards, it became a popular restaurant where beer and
other drinks were served by young women dressed in the national
costume associated with drinking, particularly the German beer
costume. Today, brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks around
the clock.</p>

uncertain. The spelling Ἀπόλλων (pronounced [a.pól.lɔːn]
in classical Attic) had almost supplanted all other forms by the
beginning of the Common Era, but the Doric form Apellon (Ἀπέλλων)
is more archaic, derived from the earlier *Ἀπέλjων. It is
probably related to the Dorian kk <font color="#a9a9a9">Apellaios
</font>(Ἀπελλαῖος) and the offerings <font color="#dcdcdc">Apellaia
</font>(ἀπελλαῖα), which were given at the initiation of
young men during the family feast Apellai (ἀπέλλαι).
According to some scholars, the words derive from the Doric word
<font color="#2f4f4f">apella </font>(ἀπέλλα), which originally
meant 'wall', 'animal enclosure' and later 'assembly within the
boundaries of a square'. <font color="#556b2f">Apella </font>(Ἀπέλλα)
is the name of the Spartan assembly, equivalent to ecclesia
(ἐκκλησία). R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the
theonym with the noun apellai and proposed the pre-Greek proto-form
*Apalyun.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">There is ample evidence of a
vernacular etymology from ancient writers. Thus, the Greeks most
often associated the name Apollo with the Greek verb ἀπόλλυμι
(<font color="#a9a9a9">apollymi)</font>, &quot;to destroy&quot;. In
Cratylus, Plato associates the name with ἀπόλυσις
(apolysis), 'redemption', ἀπόλουσις (apolousis),
'purification', and ἁπλοῦν ([h]aploun), 'simple',
specifically referring to the Thessalian form of the name Ἄπλουν,
and finally Ἀειβάλλων (aeiballon), 'always shooting'.
Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Dorian ἀπέλλα
(<font color="#dcdcdc">apella), </font>meaning 'assembly', so Apollo
would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation

over the centuries he was given different roles, which may have come
from different gods. In archaic Greece, he was a prophet, an oracle
god who in ancient times was associated with 'healing'. In classical
Greece he was the god of light and music, but in popular religion he
had a strong role in keeping evil at bay. <font color="#dcdcdc">Walter

Dionysus, Apollo's Helios and Apollo's son <font color="#a9a9a9">Asclepius</font>,

invoke protection against illness and misfortune </font>or to express
thanks after protection had been granted. In this way, Apollo was
recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of Python
led to his being associated with battle and victory, and it therefore
became customary for the Romans to sing the paean when the army
marched and before going into battle, when the fleet left port and
also after victory.</p>

oracle cult in Delphi during the Mycenaean era. In historical times,
the priests of Delphoi were called <font color="#a9a9a9">Labryades</font>,
'double carpenters', suggesting a Minoan origin. The double axe,
<font color="#dcdcdc">labrys</font>, was the sacred symbol of the
Cretan labyrinth. Homer's hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin
and took the Cretan priests to Delphi, where they apparently
transferred their religious practices. Apollo Delphinios was a sea
god worshipped especially in Crete and the islands, and his name
indicates his connection with Delphi and the sacred serpent Delphyne
('womb'). Apollo's sister <font color="#2f4f4f">Artemis</font>, the
Greek goddess of the hunt, is identified with the Minoan 'animal
mistress' <font color="#556b2f">Britomartis </font>(Diktynna). In the
earliest depictions she is accompanied by the 'lord of animals', a
male god of the hunt, whose attribute was the bow. His original name
is not known, but it seems that he merged with the more popular
Apollo, who stood beside the virgin 'Mistress of the Animals' and
became her brother.</p>

deities, Apollo had two cult sites with wide influence: <font color="#a9a9a9">Delos

Delphi) were so different in cult practices that both could have
shrines in the same place. The cult of Apollo was already fully
established by the time the written sources begin, around 650 BC.
Apollo became a very important oracle deity for the Greek world
during the Archaic period, and his popularity is reflected in the
prevalence of theophoric names such as Apollodoros or Apollonios, and
the cities named Apollonia. Oracular shrines to Apollo were also
founded in other places. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, so-called
'<font color="#dcdcdc">theological oracles' </font>were recited in
the shrines of Didymas and Clarus, in which Apollo affirmed that all
deities are aspects or servants of the all-encompassing, supreme
deity. &quot;In the 3rd century Apollo was silent. <font color="#2f4f4f">Julian

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In Greece and the Greek colonies,
many temples dedicated to Apollo were built, showing the spread of
the cult of Apollo and the development of Greek architecture, which
was mostly based on the correctness of form and mathematical
relationships. Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, do
not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first <font color="#a9a9a9">peripteral
temples </font>were rectangular wooden structures. The various wooden
elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in
the marble or stone elements of the temples of the Doric order. The
Greeks used standard forms because they believed that the world of
objects was a series of typical shapes that could be represented in
many different ways. Temples should be canonical, and architects
strove to achieve aesthetic perfection. From the earliest times,
rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings strictly followed
certain rules. The first buildings were narrow <font color="#dcdcdc">to
accommodate the roof</font>, and as dimensions changed, certain
mathematical ratios became necessary to <font color="#2f4f4f">preserve
the original shapes</font>. This probably influenced <font color="#556b2f">Pythagoras'

a god of Asia Minor named Appaliunas or Apalunas, associated with the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Kouros </font>(male
youth) is a modern term given to depictions of standing male youths,
which first appeared in the Greek Archaic period. This type served
certain religious needs and was first proposed as the Apollo
depictions, which were previously considered to be the Apollo
depictions. The first statues are certainly immobile and formal. The
formality of their pose seems to be related to Egyptian precedent,
but it was adopted for good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of
what a young man was like, and embodied the archaic smile of good
manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, the
dignity and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most
enduring qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with
the immutable gods. The adoption of a recognisable standard type over
a long period of time was probably due to nature's preference for a
type that had long been accepted by climatic conditions for survival,
and also to the general belief among the Greeks that nature expressed
itself in ideal forms that could be imagined and represented. These
forms expressed immortality. <font color="#dcdcdc">Apollo </font>was
the immortal god of ideal balance and order<font color="#dcdcdc">.</font>
In his sanctuary at Delphi, which he shared with Dionysius in winter,
were the inscriptions γνῶθι σεαυτόν (gnōthi seautón =
'know thyself') and μηδὲν ἄγαν (mēdén ágan, 'nothing
excessive') and ἐγγύα πάρα δ'ἄτη (eggýa pára d'atē,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the first large-scale depictions
of the <font color="#a9a9a9">early Archaic period </font>(640-580
BC), artists sought to draw attention to the interior of the face and
body, which were not presented as inanimate masses but as full of
life. The Greeks retained until the latest phase of their
civilisation the almost animistic idea that statues were in some
sense alive. This reflects the belief that the image was in some way
a god or man himself. A fine example is the statue of Kouros of the
Holy Gate, found in the cemetery of Dipylon Kouros in Athens. The
statue is a 'thing in itself', and its slender face with its deep
eyes expresses intellectual eternity. According to Greek tradition,
Dipylon's master was called <font color="#dcdcdc">Daedalus</font>,
and in his statues the limbs were detached from the body, giving the
impression that the statues could move. He is also credited with
creating the Kouros of New York, the oldest fully preserved Kouros
statue, which appears to be the embodiment of the god himself.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The earliest examples of statues of
Apollo are perhaps two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island
of Delos. Such statues were found all over the Greek-speaking world,
and most of them were found in shrines to Apollo, with over a hundred
from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios in Boeotia alone. The final stage
in the development of the Kouros type is the <font color="#a9a9a9">Late
Archaic period </font>(520-485 BC), when Greek sculpture achieved a
complete knowledge of human anatomy and used it to create a
relatively harmonious whole. Among the very few bronze sculptures
that have survived, the masterly bronze Apollo of Piraeus stands out.
It was found in the port of Athens, in <font color="#dcdcdc">Piraeus.
</font>Originally, the statue held <font color="#2f4f4f">a bow in </font>its
left hand <font color="#2f4f4f">and a </font><font color="#556b2f">cup
in </font>its right hand, into <font color="#556b2f">which a libation
was poured.</font> It probably comes from the north-eastern
Peloponnese. The emphasis is on anatomy, and it is one of the first
attempts to represent a kind of movement and beauty in relation to
proportions, which are mostly found in post-archaic art. The statue
sheds some light on the artistic centre, which, with its
independently developed harder, simpler and heavier style, limits the
Ionian influence in Athens. Ultimately, this is the initial impetus
from which Polykleitos' art grew two or three generations later.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the next century, at the
beginning of the classical period, it was considered that beauty in
visible things, as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and
proportion. Artists also attempted to represent movement in a given
moment (Myron), which can be seen as a resurgence of the dormant
Minotaur element. Anatomy and geometry merge, each doing something to
the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for
mathematical proportions, just as they looked for some kind of
reality behind appearances. In his canon, <font color="#a9a9a9">Polycleitus
</font>wrote that beauty is not in the proportions of elements
(materials) but in the proportions of parts, that is, in the
relationship of parts to each other and to the whole. He seems to
have been influenced by Pythagoras' theories. The famous Apollo of
Mantua and its variations are early forms of <font color="#dcdcdc">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although proportions were always
important in Greek art, the charm of Greek sculpture cannot be
explained by proportions alone. Statues of <font color="#a9a9a9">Apollo
</font>were believed to embody his living presence, and these
representations of an illusory, imaginative reality had deep roots in
<font color="#dcdcdc">the Minoan </font>period and in the beliefs of
the first Greek-speaking people who arrived in the region in the
Bronze Age. Just as <font color="#2f4f4f">the Greeks </font>saw
mountains, forests, seas and rivers as inhabited by concrete
creatures, so too nature in all its manifestations has a distinct
form and a form of artwork. Spiritual life is contained in matter
when it is given artistic form. Just as in art the Greeks sought some
reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent
principles that could be applied wherever conditions were the same.
Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation to
mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order was revealed not
so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self.
Things as we see them and as they really are are one, each
emphasizing the nature of the other as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Bush administration then turned
its attention to Iraq, claiming that <font color="#a9a9a9">the need
to oust Saddam Hussein </font>had become urgent. The reasons given
included the fact that Saddam's regime had attempted to acquire
nuclear material and had not properly accounted for the <font color="#dcdcdc">biological
and chemical material it </font>was known to have previously
possessed and was believed to still retain. Both the possession of
these <font color="#2f4f4f">weapons of mass destruction </font>and
Saddam's failure to account for them would violate UN sanctions. From
the outset, the Bush administration was vehement in its claims of
<font color="#556b2f">WMD</font>, but other major powers, including
China, France, Germany and Russia, were not convinced that Iraq was a
threat and refused to accept the <font color="#6b8e23">UN Security
Council resolution </font>authorising the use of force. In <font color="#a0522d">November
</font>2002, Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors to continue their
work to assess allegations of weapons of mass destruction, when the
Bush administration decided to continue the war <font color="#228b22">without
UN authorisation </font>and ordered the inspectors to leave the
country. The US invaded Iraq on <font color="#191970">20 March 2003,
together with a </font>'coalition of the willing', consisting of
additional forces from the UK and, to a lesser extent, Australia and
Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion collapsed both the
Iraqi government and its armed forces, but the US and its allies
failed to find a single weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of
previous materials and weapons laboratories were reportedly found,
but no 'smoking guns'. Nevertheless, on 1 May, George W. Bush landed
on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in a Lockheed S-3 Viking,
where he made a speech announcing the end of the &quot;major combat
operations&quot; of the Iraq war. According to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll, Bush's approval rating in May was 66 percent. However, Bush's
high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was
popular in the United States, the reconstruction of Iraq and the
'democratisation' efforts lost some support as the months passed and
the casualty figures increased, with no reduction in violence and no
progress towards stability or reconstruction. Secondly, the
researchers <font color="#8b0000">did not find the predicted
stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction when they </font>scoured
the country, leading to a debate about the justification for war.</p>

major candidates were ahead. <font color="#a9a9a9">It was clear that
in Ohio and the two other states that had not yet declared (New
Mexico and Iowa), the result would decide the winner</font>. Mr Bush
had achieved a lead of <font color="#dcdcdc">around 130 000 votes</font>,
but the Democrats were referring to the <font color="#2f4f4f">provisional
ballots </font><font color="#556b2f">yet to be counted</font><font color="#2f4f4f">,
which had </font><font color="#556b2f">initially been reported as
high as 200 000. </font>Bush was provisionally leading with <font color="#6b8e23">less
than 5% of the </font>vote in only four states, but if Iowa, Nevada
and New Mexico had eventually gone to Kerry, Bush's win in Ohio would
have resulted in a 269-269 victory in the electoral college. <font color="#a0522d">A
tie in the electoral college would result in the election being
decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one
vote regardless of population</font>. Such a scenario would almost
certainly have resulted in a Bush victory, since the Republicans
controlled more delegations in the House of Representatives. Thus,
the <font color="#228b22">outcome of the election depended solely on
the result in </font><font color="#191970">Ohio, </font>regardless of
the final outcome elsewhere. In the afternoon, Ohio Secretary of
State Ken Blackwell announced that it was statistically impossible
for the Democrats to <font color="#8b0000">get enough qualified votes
in the primaries to win</font>. At the time, the number of
provisional ballots was reported to be 140,000 (and later estimated
to be only 135,000). Following this announcement, John Kerry conceded
defeat. If Kerry had won Ohio, he would have won the election even
though he would have lost the national vote by more than 3 million
votes, a complete reversal of the 2000 election, when Bush won the
presidency even though he lost the vote to <font color="#483d8b">Al

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The current liberal party generally
supports economic liberalism (see <font color="#a9a9a9">New Right</font>).
Historically, the party has been more in favour of <font color="#dcdcdc">economic
protectionism and interventionism </font>than in recent decades.
However, since its inception, the party has considered itself
<font color="#2f4f4f">anti-socialist.</font> Strong opposition to
socialism and communism in Australia and abroad was one of its
founding principles. <font color="#556b2f">Robert Menzies, the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Throughout its history, the Liberals
have largely been an electorally relevant party for the <font color="#a9a9a9">middle
class </font>(whom Menzies called &quot;the forgotten people&quot; at
the party's inception), although such class-based voting patterns are
no longer as evident as they once were. The <font color="#dcdcdc">1970s
saw </font>the emergence of a left-wing middle class that no longer
voted Liberal. One effect in the 1970s was the success of the
Australian Democrats breakaway party founded in 1977 by former
Liberal minister <font color="#556b2f">Don Chipp </font>and members
of smaller Liberal parties; others in the left-wing section of the
middle class switched to Labor.[On the other hand, the Liberals have
been increasingly successful in recent years among socially
conservative working-class voters. however, the Liberal Party's main
base of support remains the upper middle class; 16 of the 20 richest
federal electorates are held by <font color="#6b8e23">the Liberals</font>,
and most of these are safe seats. In rural areas, they either compete
or truce with the Nationals, depending on various factors.</p>

Liberals was the <font color="#a9a9a9">United Australia Party (UAP)</font>.
More broadly, the ideological heritage of the Liberal Party extended
<font color="#dcdcdc">to the anti-labour factions of the first
Commonwealth parliaments</font>. The Commonwealth Liberal Party was
the <font color="#2f4f4f">1909 </font>merger of the Free Trade Party
and the Protectionist Party by the second Prime Minister Alfred
Deakin in response to the growing electoral weight of the Labor
Party. The Commonwealth Liberal Party merged with several Labor
dissidents (including Billy Hughes) to form the <font color="#556b2f">Australian
National Party </font>in <font color="#6b8e23">1917</font>, which in
turn merged with Labor dissidents to form the UAP in 1931.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The UAP had been formed as a new
conservative alliance in 1931, led by the Labor defector Joseph
Lyons, whose position and that of other Labor rebels against the more
radical proposals of the labor movement to deal with the <font color="#a9a9a9">Great
Depression </font>had won the support of prominent Australian
conservatives. With Australia still suffering the effects of the
<font color="#dcdcdc">Great Depression</font>, the newly formed party
won a landslide victory in the 1931 election, and Lyons' government
won <font color="#2f4f4f">three </font>consecutive elections. It
largely eschewed Keynesian pump-priming and pursued a <font color="#556b2f">more
conservative fiscal policy based on debt reduction and a balanced
budget to help </font>Australia survive the recession. <font color="#6b8e23">After
Lyons' death in 1939, </font>Robert Menzies took over as Prime
Minister on the eve of war. Menzies served as Prime Minister from
<font color="#a0522d">1939 to 1941</font>, but resigned as leader of
the minority government of World War II when the parliamentary
majority fell short. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, collapsed after
suffering a heavy defeat in the 1943 elections.</p>

Cold War, Menzies spoke of the possibility of a looming third world
war. The Menzies government formed Australia's first formal military
alliance outside the British Commonwealth when the <font color="#a9a9a9">ANZUS
treaty </font>between <font color="#dcdcdc">Australia, New Zealand
and the United States was </font>signed <font color="#2f4f4f">in San
Francisco in </font>1951. Foreign Minister Percy Spender had put
forward a proposal for the alliance to operate along the lines of
NATO. The treaty stated that any attack against any of the three
parties in the Pacific would be considered a threat to each party and
that the common danger would be met in accordance with the
constitutional procedures of each country. In 1954, the Menzies
government <font color="#556b2f">signed the Southeast </font><font color="#6b8e23">Asia
Joint Defence Treaty </font><font color="#556b2f">(SEATO) </font>as a
Southeast Asian counterpart to NATO. In the same year, Soviet
diplomat Vladimir Petrov and his wife defected from the Soviet
Embassy in Canberra, revealing evidence of Russian espionage
activities; Menzies called in a Royal Commission to investigate.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Menzies continued the expanded
immigration program established under Chifley and took significant
steps towards dismantling the White Australia policy. In the early
1950s, Foreign Minister Percy Spender helped to establish the Colombo
Program to provide economic assistance to underdeveloped countries in
the Australian region. Under this programme, many future Asian
leaders studied in Australia. In 1958, the government replaced the
arbitrary European language proficiency test in the Immigration Act
with an entry permit system based on <font color="#a9a9a9">economic
and skills criteria</font>. In 1962, <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Menzies Commonwealth Electoral Act </font>provided that all
Indigenous Australians should have the right to register and vote in
federal elections (prior to this, Indigenous Australians in
Queensland and Western Australia and some Indigenous Australians in
the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were
ex-servicemen). In 1949, the Liberals appointed <font color="#2f4f4f">Dame
Enid Lyons as </font>the first woman in the Australian Cabinet.
Menzies remained firmly in favour of links with the monarchy and the
British Commonwealth, but formalised the alliance with the United
States and concluded the Australia-Japan trade agreement signed in
July 1957, which launched post-war trade with Japan and began a surge
in Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that
grew steadily until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner.</p>

The Australian economy was in recession in the early 1990s.
Unemployment was <font color="#dcdcdc">11.4% </font>in 1992. <font color="#2f4f4f">In
November 1991, </font>under the leadership of Dr John Hewson, the
Opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document, a
radical collection of 'dry' economic liberal measures including the
introduction of a goods and services tax, various changes to
Medicare, including the removal of bulk billing for non-union
contract holders, a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits and
various changes to industrial relations, including the abolition of
commission income, a $13 billion income tax cut for middle and high
income earners, $10 billion in cuts to government spending, the
abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a number of
state-owned enterprises - the beginning of a very different future
from the Keynesian economic conservatism of previous Liberal and
National Coalition governments. At the heart of the policy document
was a 15% GST tax. Labour Prime Minister Paul Keating campaigned
<font color="#556b2f">throughout 1992 </font>against the Fightback
package and in particular the GST, which he described as an attack on
the working class because it shifted the tax burden from direct
taxation of the rich to indirect taxation as a broad-based
consumption tax. Pressure groups and public opinion were relentless,
leading Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST - leading to
questions about the complexity of which foods were and were not to be
exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to voters
was demonstrated by <font color="#6b8e23">the infamous birthday cake
interview</font>, which some consider a turning point in the election
campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labour term in the
1993 election. Several of the proposals were later passed into law in
some form, to a lesser extent under Keating's Labor government and to
a greater extent under Howard's Liberal government (the most famous
being the GST), while the Abbott Liberal government revisited
unemployment benefits and the mass bill for a time.</p>

</font>was originally a verb meaning &quot;to serve&quot; or &quot;to
follow persons&quot; in the upper ranks of society, and this is also
true of the original Japanese term saburau. In both countries, the
terms were named to mean &quot;those who serve in the close company
of nobles&quot;, and the Japanese pronunciation was changed to
saburau. According to Wilson, an early reference to the word
'samurai' appears <font color="#2f4f4f">in Kok's Wakashū </font>(<font color="#556b2f">905-914)</font>,

After the Battle of Hakusukinoe against <font color="#a9a9a9">Tang
China and Silla, </font>which led to <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Japanese withdrawal from Korea</font>, Japan underwent major reforms.
One of the most important was the Taika reform, issued by <font color="#556b2f">Prince
Naka no Ōe (Emperor Tenji) </font>in <font color="#6b8e23">646 AD.</font>
This edict enabled the Japanese aristocracy to adopt the political
structure, bureaucracy, culture, religion and philosophy of the Tang
dynasty. The Taihō Code of 702 AD and the later Yōrō Code required
the population to register regularly for a census, a precursor to
national conscription. Knowing how the population was divided,
Emperor Mommu introduced a law that every fourth or four of four
adult males would be called up for the national army. These soldiers
had to buy their own weapons, and in return they were exempt from
customs duties and taxes. This was one of the first attempts by the
imperial government to form an organised army on the model of the
Chinese system. Later historians called it the &quot;Gundan-Sei&quot;
(<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">軍団制</font>), and it is believed to
have been short-lived.</p>

<font color="#dcdcdc">900s</font>, Emperor Kammu sought to
consolidate and expand his rule in northern Honshū, but the armies

</font>(<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">征夷大将軍</font>) or shogun
and began to rely on powerful regional clans to conquer the Emish.
These clan warriors, skilled in cavalry fighting and archery (kyūdō),
became the emperor's primary tool for defeating rebellions. Although
this is the first known use of the title 'shogun', it was a temporary
title and did not carry any political power until the 1200s. At that
time (7th-9th century), they were regarded by the officials of the
imperial court as merely a military unit under the control of the

</font>peasants and samurai and sent it to Korea. (See Hideyoshi's
invasions of Korea, Chōsen-seibatsu (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">朝鮮征伐</font>?).
The Japanese samurai armies took advantage of their mastery of the
bow and arrow and their extensive war experience from the Sengoku
period to achieve significant victories in most of Korea. Kato
Kiyomasa advanced northeast into the Orangka region (now Manchuria)
bordering Korea and crossed the border into Manchuria, but withdrew
after counterattacks by the Yurchen in the area, as it was clear that
he had outflanked the other Japanese invasion forces. Some of the
most famous samurai generals of this war were Katō Kiyomasa, Konishi
Yukinaga and Shimazu Yoshihiro. Shimazu Yoshihiro led some 7,000
samurai and defeated an allied force of Ming and Korean troops at the
Battle of Sacheon in <font color="#556b2f">1598</font>, near the end
of the campaigns, despite being heavily outnumbered. Yoshihiro was
feared as Oni-Shimazu ('the giant of Shimazu'), and his nickname
spread not only to Korea but also to Ming Dynasty China. Despite the
superiority of Japanese ground forces, both campaigns ultimately
failed (although they did destroy Korean territory), due in part to
the superiority of the Korean navy (led by Admiral Yi Sun-shin, who
constantly disrupted Japanese supply lines throughout the war), which
led to a shortage of supplies on land), the commitment of substantial
Ming forces to Korea, Korean guerrilla operations, underestimated
resistance by Japanese commanders (in the first campaign in 1592, the
Korean defenders were caught unprepared, under-equipped and
under-equipped; they were quickly overrun, with only a few successful
battles against the more experienced and battle-hardened Japanese
forces - in the second campaign of 1597, the Koreans and Ming forces
proved a much more difficult challenge, and, aided by continued
Korean naval superiority, the Japanese limited their victories to
parts of southeast Korea), and Japanese commitment to the campaigns
faltered as the wars dragged on. The final death blow to the Japanese
Korean campaigns came with the death of Hideyoshi in late <font color="#6b8e23">1598
</font>and the recall of all Japanese troops in Korea by the Council
of Five Elders (established by Hideyoshi to oversee the transition

14th centuries </font>&quot;depicted the Bush in their natural

service of a military leader or emperor: &quot;It is unfortunate to
let the moment of death pass by....A man whose profession is the use
of arms should first think and then act not only for his own
reputation but also for the reputation of his posterity. He should
not disgrace his name forever by holding his only life too
dear....His main purpose in throwing away his life is to do so for
the great enterprise of either the Emperor or some military general.
That is what will give his descendants a great reputation.&quot;</p>

These practices were derived from <font color="#2f4f4f">Chinese arts</font>.

</font>flourished thanks to the interest of powerful warrior elites.
Musō Soseki (<font color="#6b8e23">1275-1351) </font>was a Zen monk
who served as adviser to both Emperor Go-Daigo and General Ashikaga
Takauji (1304-58). Like other monks, Musō served as a political and
cultural diplomat between Japan and China. Musō was particularly
known for his garden design. Another patron of Ashikaga art was
Yoshimasa. His cultural adviser, the Zen monk Zeami, introduced him
to the tea ceremony. In the past, tea had been used mainly to keep

elected head of the Tachibana clan after the death of his father.
Yamauchi Kazutoyo's wife Chiyo has long been regarded as the ideal
samurai wife. Legend has it that she made her kimono from old pieces
of cloth on a patchwork quilt and saved her pennies to buy her
husband a magnificent horse, which he rode to many victories. That
Chiyo (though better known as 'Yamauchi Kazutoyo's wife') is so
highly regarded for her financial acumen is instructive in light of
the fact that she never produced an heir and that the Yamauchi clan
was inherited by Kazutoyo's younger brother. The source of women's
power may have been that the samurai left their households to their
wives.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As early as the seventh century,
Japanese warriors wore <font color="#a9a9a9">a type of lamellar
armour</font>, which eventually evolved into the armour used by the
samurai. The first types of Japanese armour identified as samurai
armour were known as <font color="#dcdcdc">yoroi. </font>This early
samurai armour was made from small individual scales called <font color="#2f4f4f">kozane</font>.
Kozane were made of either <font color="#556b2f">iron or leather and
were </font>bound together in small strips, which were coated with a
varnish to protect the kozane from water. Several strips of kozane
were then bound together with silk or leather ribbon to form a

called <font color="#556b2f">Tosei-gusoku </font>or modern armour.
The samurai's body was also protected by other parts of the armour.
The helmet kabuto was an important part of the samurai armour.
Samurai armour changed and evolved as the samurai's methods of
warfare changed over the centuries. The last time samurai armour was
reportedly worn was in <font color="#6b8e23">1877 </font>during the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The term samurai originally meant
&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">those who serve the nobility</font>&quot;,
and was written in the Chinese character kanji, which had the same
meaning. In Japanese, it was originally recorded in the Nara period
as the verb *samorapu (&quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">to watch, keep
watch, observe, be on guard; to serve, to care</font>&quot;), which
is believed to be derived from the infinitive form of the verb moru
(<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">守らふ</font>, &quot;to watch, guard,
be on guard; to keep, protect, care for, be in charge of, be warded&quot;)
(*morapu <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">守らふ</font>). By the Heian
period, this word had evolved into the verb saburahu (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">さぶらふ</font>,
&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">to serve, look after</font>&quot;), from
which was later derived the deverbal noun saburahi (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">さぶらひ</font>,
&quot;<font color="#556b2f">servant, caretaker&quot;), which </font>then
became samurahi in <font color="#6b8e23">the Edo period </font>(<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">さむらひ</font>).
In Japanese literature, samurai is mentioned early in Kokinshū (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">古今集</font>,

continually updated as new failures and corner cases are discovered,
and are integrated into the regression tests that are developed. Unit
tests are maintained together with the rest of the software source
code and are usually integrated into the build process (interactive

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">It has been shown that <font color="#a9a9a9">each
category is strictly contained within </font><font color="#dcdcdc">the
next category</font>. For example, a test assuming that the behaviour
of the implementation under test can be described by a deterministic
finite state machine for some known finite set of inputs and outputs,
and which has some known number of states, belongs to <font color="#2f4f4f">class
I </font>(and all subsequent classes). However, if the number of
states is not known, it belongs to all classes only <font color="#556b2f">from

deterministic finite state machine that does not satisfy the
definition of a single trace (and its continuations) and the number
of states is unknown, it belongs only to classes <font color="#6b8e23">III
</font>and above. Testing of temporal machines, in which transitions
are triggered if inputs are produced within some real finite time
interval, falls only into Class IV or thereafter, while testing of
many non-deterministic systems falls only into Class V (but not all,
and some even fall into Class I). Class I does not require <font color="#a0522d">the
simplicity of the assumed computational model, since it has been

in any programming language and defined as machines that depend on
continuous quantities belong to Class I. Other more sophisticated
