<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The building at the heart of the
current palace was originally known as<font color="#a9a9a9">
Buckingham House</font>, a large town house built <font color="#dcdcdc">for
the Duke of Buckingham in </font>1703 on land that had been privately
owned for at least 150 years. It was bought by<font color="#2f4f4f">
</font>King<font color="#2f4f4f"> George III </font>in 1761 as the
private residence of Queen Charlotte and was known as <font color="#556b2f">'The
Queen's House'. </font>The house was extended in the 19th century,
mainly by the architects <font color="#6b8e23">John Nash and Edward
Blore</font>, who built three wings around the central courtyard.
Buckingham Palace became the residence of the British monarch in
London after Queen Victoria became King in <font color="#a0522d">1837</font>.</p>

was unaware that in 1640 the deed 'did not pass the Great Seal until

with the help of architect <font color="#556b2f">John Nash.</font>
Some of the furniture was carried over from Carlton House, and some
had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The exterior
façade was designed with the French neoclassicism favoured by George
IV in mind. The cost of renovation increased dramatically, and in
<font color="#6b8e23">1829 </font>Nash's extravagant designs led to
his dismissal as architect. After George IV's death in 1830, his
younger brother King William IV hired <font color="#a0522d">Edward

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Buckingham Palace finally became the
main royal residence in <font color="#a9a9a9">1837, when </font><font color="#dcdcdc">Queen
Victoria, the </font>first monarch to live there, became Royal
President; her predecessor <font color="#2f4f4f">William IV </font>had
died before the palace was completed<font color="#a9a9a9">.</font>
While the state rooms were a riot of gilded and colourful spaces, the
new palace was a little less luxurious. For one thing, <font color="#556b2f">the
chimneys were </font>said to <font color="#556b2f">smoke </font>so
much that the fires had to be allowed to die out, causing the court
to shake in the icy glow. The ventilation was so bad that the
interiors stank, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there
was serious concern about gas accumulating in the lower floors. It
was also said that the staff were loose and lazy and the palace was
filthy. When the Queen married in 1840, her husband, <font color="#6b8e23">Prince
Albert, </font>took charge of reorganising the household offices and
staff, as well as the palace's design flaws. All the problems were
fixed by the end of <font color="#a0522d">1840</font>. However, the
builders were due to return within a decade.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The palace measures 108 metres (354
feet) x 120 metres (390 feet), is 24 metres (79 feet) high and has
over <font color="#a9a9a9">77 000 m2 (830 000 square feet) </font>of
floor space. The floor area is smaller than that of the Royal Palace
in Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg
Palace in Vienna or the Forbidden City. The palace has 775 rooms,
including <font color="#dcdcdc">19 banqueting rooms</font>, <font color="#2f4f4f">52
</font>master bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, <font color="#556b2f">92
offices </font>and <font color="#6b8e23">78 </font><font color="#a0522d">bathrooms</font>.
The main rooms are located in the piano nobile behind the west-facing
garden façade of the palace. The centrepiece of this series of
ornate banqueting rooms is the <font color="#228b22">music room,
</font>whose large bow is the dominant feature of the façade. The
Music Room is flanked by a Blue and White Drawing Room. In the centre
of the suite is a 55-metre-long Picture Gallery, lit from above,
which serves as a corridor connecting the state rooms. The Gallery is
hung with numerous works by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer,
among others; other rooms leading from the Gallery are the Throne
Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a
vast antechamber to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial
route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the grand
staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert, dressed in Roman costume, placed on a
tapestry-lined tribune. These very formal rooms are used only for
ceremonial occasions and formal entertainment, but are open to the
public every summer.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When foreign heads of state make a
state visit to Britain, the Queen usually entertains them at
Buckingham Palace. They are booked into a large suite called <font color="#a9a9a9">the
Belgian Suite</font>, located at the foot of the <font color="#2f4f4f">ministerial
stairs </font><font color="#6b8e23">on the ground floor of the

of which has been given extra height and perspective by the addition
of saucer-shaped domes designed by Nash in <font color="#228b22">the
style of Soane</font>. The other corridor in the suite features a
Gothic-inspired cross vault. The Belgian Rooms were decorated in the
contemporary style and named after Prince Albert's uncle, the first
King of Belgium, Léopold I. In 1936, the suite briefly became the
palace's private apartments when King Edward VIII lived there.</p>

Castle, Kensington Palace and St James's Palace are part of the Royal

when the Queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps. For this
celebration, all the banqueting halls are occupied as the Royal
Family pass through them, starting at the large north doors of the
Picture Gallery. As Nash had designed, all the large, double mirrored
doors stand open and reflect numerous crystal chandeliers and lamps,
creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The last major building work was
carried out under <font color="#a9a9a9">King George V</font>, when
<font color="#dcdcdc">Sir Aston Webb </font>redesigned the eastern
façade of the 1850s Blore in 1913 to partly resemble Giacomo Leon's
Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, redesigned main façade (in <font color="#2f4f4f">Portland
stone) </font>was designed as a backdrop for the Victoria Memorial, a
large memorial statue to Queen Victoria set outside the main gates.
<font color="#556b2f">George V</font>, who had succeeded Edward VII
in 1910, was a more serious personage than his father; there was now
more emphasis on formal entertainment and royal duties than on
extravagant celebrations. He organised a series of command
performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland
Jazz Band (1919) - the first jazz performance for a head of state,
Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong (1932), which led to the palace
being nominated for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque at the 2009 Brecon Jazz
Festival as one of the venues with the greatest influence on jazz
music in the UK. George V's wife, <font color="#6b8e23">Queen Mary,
</font>was a lover of the arts and took a keen interest in the <font color="#a0522d">royal
collection of furniture and art, which </font>she both restored and
added to. <font color="#228b22">Queen Mary </font>also installed many
new furnishings and fittings, including the Benjamin Vulliamy marble
Empire-style chimneys of 1810, which the Queen installed in the
ground floor Bow Room, a huge low room in the centre of the garden
courtyard. <font color="#191970">Queen Mary </font>was also
responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This
21-metre (69-foot) long room, formerly known as the South Drawing
Room, has a ceiling specially designed by Nash and decorated with
huge gilded cantilevers.</p>

The </font>palace's more valuable possessions were evacuated to

in place. The King ordered rationing of the palace, to the horror of

him to go further and lock the wine cellars in ostentatious fashion,
abstaining from <font color="#6b8e23">alcohol to set a </font>good
example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers
continued to drink, and the King was left dissatisfied with the
enforced abstinence. In 1938, the North West Pavilion, designed by

crashed into a German bomber which he believed was bombing the

and made a quick decision <font color="#556b2f">to ram it.</font>
Holmes jumped out. Both planes crashed. In fact, the <font color="#6b8e23">Dornier

crew were dead and the rest had been rescued. Its pilot, Feldwebel
Robert Zehbe, landed on the ground only to die later from injuries
sustained in the attack. As the Dornier landed, it somehow discharged
its bombs, one of which hit the palace. It then crashed into the
forecourt of Victoria Station in London. The bomber's engine was
later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British
pilot became the <font color="#a0522d">King's Messenger </font>after

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1878, with the help of vacuum
pump expert <font color="#a9a9a9">Charles Stearn, </font>Swan
developed <font color="#dcdcdc">a refining method to avoid early bulb
blackening</font>. This was granted a British patent in 1880. On 18
December 1878, a <font color="#2f4f4f">lamp using a thin carbon rod
was </font>demonstrated at a <font color="#556b2f">meeting of the
Newcastle Chemical Society, </font>and Swan gave a working
demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also
demonstrated to 700 attendees at a meeting of the Newcastle upon Tyne
Literary and Philosophical Society on 3 February 1879. These lamps
used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a thin filament.
Consequently, they had low resistance and required very large
conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not
commercially viable, although they did provide a demonstration of the
potential of incandescent lamps with a relatively high vacuum, a
carbon filament and platinum conductors. Not only did they require
too much power to the central station electrical system to be
practical, they had a very short lifetime. Swan turned his attention
to making better carbon wire and ways of attaching its ends. He
developed a method of processing cotton to produce <font color="#6b8e23">&quot;parchmentized
yarn&quot; </font>and was awarded patent 4933 in <font color="#a0522d">1880</font>.
From this year he began to install incandescent light bulbs in homes
and landmarks in England. His house was the first in the world to be
lit by incandescent light bulbs, and also the first in the world to
be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878, Lord Armstrong's home in
Cragside was also one of the first houses to be lit by electricity.
He had set up his company in the early 1880s. In 1881, the <font color="#228b22">Savoy
Theatre in Westminster, London, </font>was lit by Swan light bulbs,
the first theatre and the first public building in the world to be
lit entirely by electricity.</p>

Edison finally returned to the <font color="#2f4f4f">carbon </font>filament.
The first successful test took place on 22 October 1879 and lasted
<font color="#556b2f">13.5 hours. </font>Edison continued to improve
on this design, and on 4 November 1879 he applied for a US patent for
an electric light bulb using 'a carbon filament or strip twisted and
connected to ... platinum contact wires'. Although the patent
described several ways of making carbon filament, including the use
of &quot;cotton and linen yarns, wooden wires and papers wrapped in
various ways&quot;, Edison and his team later discovered that the
carbonised bamboo carbon lasted for more than 1200 hours. In 1880,

</font>(carbonised paper or bamboo). <font color="#dcdcdc">Early
carbon fibre </font>filaments had a negative temperature coefficient

fluctuations in the power supply, as a small increase in voltage
caused the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing
it to draw more current and get even hotter. In the flashing process,
the carbon filaments were heated by the current that passed through
them while they were in an evacuated container containing hydrocarbon

filament had the property of gradually shortening during use; the
filaments were mounted in large loops which tightened during use.
This made the lamps, which had been in use for several hundred hours,
quite fragile. The metal filaments could break and re-weld, but this
generally reduced the resistance and shortened the life of the
filament. <font color="#a0522d">General Electric </font>acquired the

The club became the first southern member of the Football League in
1893, starting in the Second Division and rising to the First
Division in 1904. The club's relative geographical isolation led to
lower attendances than other clubs, which led to the club running

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1949, the club introduced a
modernised coat of arms with a similar cannon below the club's name
in black letters and above the Islington town coat of arms, and a
scroll bearing the club's newly adopted Latin motto <font color="#dcdcdc">Victoria
Concordia Crescit </font>&quot;Victory comes from harmony&quot;,
coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer. For the first
time, the coat of arms <font color="#2f4f4f">used colours which
</font>changed slightly over the life of the coat of arms, eventually
becoming <font color="#556b2f">red, gold and green.</font> Due to the
numerous changes made to the coat of arms, Arsenal was unable to
obtain copyright to it. Although the club had succeeded in
registering the crest as <font color="#6b8e23">a trademark </font>and
had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle against a local
street vendor selling 'unofficial' Arsenal products, Arsenal
eventually sought more comprehensive legal protection. So in 2002 it
adopted a new coat of <font color="#a0522d">arms</font> with more
modern curved lines and a simplified style that was copyrightable.
The cannon again points east and the club's name is written in
sans-serif font above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue.
Some supporters criticised the new crest; the Arsenal Independent
Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of
Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical and modern design

its history have been <font color="#a9a9a9">bright red </font>shirts
with <font color="#dcdcdc">white </font>sleeves and white shorts,
although this has not always been the case. The choice of red is a

Two of <font color="#6b8e23">Dial Square'</font>s founding members,
<font color="#a0522d">Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, </font>were
former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. When they
were putting together the first team in the area, no equipment was to
be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home to ask for help and were
given equipment and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark red
colour, and was worn with <font color="#228b22">white </font>shorts
and socks with blue and white rims.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In 1933, <font color="#dcdcdc">Herbert
Chapman</font>, wanting his players to be more clearly dressed,
updated the jersey by adding <font color="#2f4f4f">white </font>sleeves
and changing the shade to a brighter <font color="#556b2f">pillar-box
red</font>. Two possibilities have been put forward as to the origin
of <font color="#6b8e23">the white sleeves</font>. According to one
story, Chapman spotted a supporter in the stands wearing a red
sleeveless blouse over a white shirt; the other is that Chapman was
inspired by a similar outfit worn by cartoonist Tom Webster, with
whom Chapman played golf. Whichever story holds true, the <font color="#a0522d">red
and white </font>shirts have come to define Arsenal, and the team has
worn the combination in all but two seasons since. The first was the
1966-67 season, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved
unpopular, and the white sleeves returned the following season. The
second was the 2005-06 season, the last season that Arsenal played <font color="#228b22">at
Highbury</font>, when the team wore red-capped shirts reminiscent of
those worn in 1913, the <font color="#191970">first season </font>at
the stadium; the following season the club reverted back to their
usual colours. For the 2008-09 season, Arsenal replaced the
traditional full white sleeves with red sleeves with a wide white
stripe.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The expansion of Highbury was
limited by the fact that the East Stand was classified as a Grade II
listed building and the other three stands were located close to
<font color="#a9a9a9">residential properties</font>. These
constraints prevented the club from maximising its match revenue in
the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s, which risked falling
behind the football boom of that period. After considering various
options, Arsenal proposed in 2000 to build a new <font color="#2f4f4f">60,361-seat
</font>stadium at Ashburton Grove, since renamed <font color="#556b2f">Emirates
Stadium</font>, some 500 metres south-west of Highbury<font color="#dcdcdc">.</font>
The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and
construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the
2006-07 season. The stadium was named after its sponsor, the airline
Emirates, with whom the club signed the biggest <font color="#6b8e23">sponsorship
deal in </font>English football history<font color="#6b8e23">, </font>worth
around <font color="#a0522d">£100 million</font>; some fans called
the stadium Ashburton Grove or Grove because they disapproved of
<font color="#228b22">corporate sponsorship in the </font>stadium's
name. The stadium is officially known as Emirates Stadium until at
least 2028, and the airline is the club's shirt sponsor until the end
of the 2018-19 season. Since the start of the 2010-11 season, the
stadium stands have been officially known as the North Bank, East
Stand, West Stand and Clock end.</p>

centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur team, in
which one of the Arsenal players is poisoned during the game. Many
Arsenal players appeared as themselves, and manager <font color="#2f4f4f">George
Allison </font>had a speaking role. More recently, <font color="#6b8e23">Nick

British society <font color="#228b22">in the 1990s</font>. The book

Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. After
winning the N.L. pennants in 1885 and '86, the White Stockings faced

of the World Series. Both seasons ended in matches with the St. Louis
Brown Stockings, with the clubs tied in 1885 and St. Louis winning in
1886. This was the beginning of what would eventually become one of
the greatest rivalries in sports. In all, the Chicago Base Ball Club,
led by Anson, won <font color="#2f4f4f">six </font>National League
pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, the nickname of the
Chicago club changed, and by 1890 it was known as the <font color="#556b2f">Chicago

owner of a popular lunch restaurant chain, who had previously owned
the short-lived Federal League Chicago Whales. As owners, the duo
moved the club from the West Side Grounds to the much newer <font color="#2f4f4f">Weeghman
Park, which </font>had been built for the Whales just two years
earlier and where the club still resides. The Cubs responded by
winning a championship in the war-shortened 1918 season, when it was
involved in another team's curse: the Boston Red Sox beat Grover
Cleveland Alexander's Cubs four games to two in the 1918 World

the twin Bills, the Cubs won the NL championship in <font color="#a9a9a9">1929
</font>and achieved the unusual feat of winning the championship
every three years thereafter, and after the 1929 championship won the
league in 1932, 1935 and 1938. Unfortunately, that success did not
extend to the fall classic, as they lost to their AL rivals each
time. The '32 series against the Yankees saw Babe Ruth's &quot;called
strike&quot; at Wrigley Field in the third game. The Cubs also had
some historic moments: in 1930, Hack Wilson, one of the best home run
<font color="#dcdcdc">hitters</font>, played one of the most
impressive seasons in MLB history, hitting 56 home runs and setting
the current record (191 runs batted in). That 1930 team, which
featured six later Hall of Famers (Wilson, Gabby Hartnett, Rogers
Hornsby, George &quot;High Pockets&quot; Kelly, Kiki Cuyler and
manager Joe McCarthy), posted a team batting average of .309 today.
In 1935, the Cubs won the championship in thrilling fashion by
winning a record <font color="#2f4f4f">21 </font>consecutive games in
September. In '38, Dizzy Dean led the team's pitching staff and
provided a historic moment when the team defeated the Pittsburgh
Pirates at Wrigley Field in a decisive late-season game with a home

Cubs will never win again.&quot; He said: &quot;The Cubs are not

and haven't come back since. Many have also said that Mr. Sianis put
a &quot;curse&quot; on the Cubs that apparently prevents the team
from playing in the World Series. After losing the 1945 World Series
to the Detroit Tigers, the Cubs finished the season victorious the
next two years, but those teams did not make the playoffs.</p>

decade, it was difficult to find a replacement for him, as there were
few quality players like Hank Sauer. This combined with poor
ownership decisions, including the coaching staff, and the
unfortunate trade of future Hall of Famer Lou Brock to the Cardinals
for pitcher Ernie Broglio (who won only seven games over the next
three seasons), hampered on-field performance.</p>

September 2 game, the Cubs' record was 84-52 and the Mets were second
at 77-55. But then the losing streak started just as the Mets'
winning streak was about to begin. The Cubs lost the final game of
the series in Cincinnati and then came home to play the upstart
Pittsburgh Pirates (who finished third). After losing the first two
games 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led until the ninth inning. A win would
be a positive springboard, as the Cubs would play a crucial series
with the Mets the very next day. However, Willie Stargell hit a
2-out, 2-strike pitch to Sheffield Avenue off Cubs ace Phil Regan to
tie the game in the top of the ninth inning. The Cubs lost 7-5 in
extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs
traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game series. The Mets won
both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 with
only a 1⁄2 game lead. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, however,
as the 99-loss Phillies beat the Cubs twice to extend Chicago's
losing streak to eight games. In the key game of the second game on
11 September, Cubs starter <font color="#556b2f">Dick Selma </font>threw
a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was
nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the
floodgates for a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the
Cubs were up 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead 85-57. The Mets
never looked back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended
the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a
ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilted by team fatigue,
generally deteriorated at every stage of the game. The Mets (who had
lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), won the World Series. The
Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, will be remembered for
losing a remarkable 17½ games to the Mets in the last quarter of the

Cubs finished fourth at 81-81, while Philadelphia moved up to 101
wins. In the next two seasons, the Cubs also got off to a fast start,
going over 10 games over .500 in both seasons, but later again tired
and played poorly, eventually settling back into mediocrity. This

field advantage had been circulating between the East and West

League Baseball decided that if the Cubs made it to the World Series,
the winner of the American League would get home field advantage
unless the Cubs played their home games somewhere else, because the
Cubs' home field at <font color="#a9a9a9">Wrigley Field did not yet

Instead of holding games at Sox Park across town, the Cubs agreed
with St. Louis Cardinals owner August A. Busch that the Cubs would
use Busch Stadium in St. Louis as the Cubs' &quot;home field&quot;
during the World Series. Major League Baseball agreed to this, and
the Cubs could have hosted Games 1 and 2 and, if necessary, Games 6
and 7. The Cubs then had the option of hosting Games 1 and 2 and, if
necessary, Games 6 and 7. Home field advantage rotated between the
leagues at that time. In odd-numbered years, the AL had home-field
advantage. In even-numbered years, the NL had home-field advantage.
In the 1982 World Series, the NL St. Louis Cardinals had home field

led to three consecutive losses. The Cubs were unable to overcome the
efforts of Will Clark, whose home run off Maddux just after the
manager's visit made Maddux think Clark knew what pitch was coming.
After that, Maddux spoke with his glove during any mound conversation

first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the team with 19 wins, Rod
Beck led a strong bullpen and Mark Grace had one of his best seasons.
The Cubs were the center of media attention in 1998, with Sosa and
newcomer Kerry Wood as the team's two biggest highlights. Wood's
milestone was a one-hit victory over the Houston Astros, where he set
a major league record with 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His
staggering strikeout totals earned Wood the nickname &quot;Kid K&quot;,
and he eventually won the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa
caught fire in June by hitting 20 home runs in a month, and his home
run contest with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire made the pair
international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire ended the
season with a new Major League record 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308
average and 66 home runs earned him the National League MVP award.
After a Wild Card game with Chicago and the San Francisco Giants,
Chicago and San Francisco finished the regular season tied, and so
they met at Wrigley Field in a one-game playoff, where third baseman
Gary Gaetti hit the winning home run. The win sent the Cubs once
again into the playoffs with a 90-73 regular season record.
Unfortunately, in October, the bats went cold when manager Jim
Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs and suffered a
loss to Atlanta. On the positive side, the home run between Sosa,
McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. helped professional baseball gain new
fans and brought back some fans disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The
Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and
after a fast start in 1999, they slumped again (starting with a
mid-June loss to the White Sox) and finished last in the division the
next two seasons.</p>

to the bleachers and said after the game that he would have caught
the ball. Alou backed down at one point, saying he couldn't have
played, but later said it was just an attempt to make Bartman feel
better and believed the whole incident should be forgotten. No
interference was sought in the game as the ball was deemed to be on
the bleachers side of the wall. Castillo eventually walked past
Prior. Two batters later and to the chagrin of a packed stadium, Cubs
shortstop Alex Gonzalez played a poorly inning-ending double play
that loaded the bases and led to eight Florida runs and a Marlins

alienated much of his once strong fan base, as well as the few
teammates who were still on good terms with him (many teammates grew
tired of Sosa playing loud salsa music in the locker room), and could
tarnish his place in Cubs history for years to come. During a
disappointing season, fans also became frustrated with the constant
injuries to ace throwers Mark Prior and Kerry Wood. In addition, the
'04 season led to the departure of popular commentator <font color="#dcdcdc">Steve

during broadcasts and was verbally attacked by substitute <font color="#2f4f4f">Kent

Central in 2006 with <font color="#a9a9a9">66 </font>wins, but in
2007 they made changes and went from &quot;worst to first&quot;. In
the offseason, they signed <font color="#dcdcdc">Alfonso Soriano to
an </font>eight-year, $136 million contract and replaced manager
Dusty Baker with fiery veteran manager <font color="#2f4f4f">Lou
Piniella</font>. After a rocky start that included a fight between
Michael Barrett and Carlos Zambrano, the Cubs defeated the Milwaukee
Brewers, who had led the division for most of the season, with
winning streaks in June and July and a couple of dramatic, late
victories over the Reds, and eventually won the NL Central
championship with a record of 85-77. The Cubs also defeated the
Milwaukee Brewers, who had led the division for most of the season.
The Cubs traded Barrett to the Padres and later acquired Jason
Kendall from Oakland. Kendall was excellent at managing the pitching
rotation and also helped with rebounding. By September, Geovany Soto
became the full-time starter behind the plate in place of the veteran
Kendall. The NLDS game faced Arizona but was followed by controversy
when, in a move that has since been criticized, Piniella pulled
Carlos Zambrano after the sixth inning in a pitcher's duel with
D-Backs ace Brandon Webb to &quot;....save Zambrano for (a possible)
Game 4.&quot; However, the Cubs failed, losing the first game and
eventually more than 30 baserunners to Arizona in a three-game

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Cubs successfully defended their
National League Central title in 2008 and reached the postseason in
consecutive years for the first time since 1906-08. The end of the
season was dominated by three months of failed trade negotiations
with the Orioles, involving 2B Brian Roberts, and Chunichi Dragons
star <font color="#a9a9a9">Kosuke Fukudome.</font> The team achieved
its 10,000th win in April, and in the process rose to the division
lead. Reed Johnson and Jim Edmonds were added early, and <font color="#dcdcdc">Rich
Harden </font>was acquired from the Oakland Athletics in early July.
The Cubs went into the All-Star break with the best record in N.L.,
setting a league record with eight representatives in the All-Star
game, including catcher <font color="#2f4f4f">Geovany Soto, </font>who
was named Rookie of the Year. The Cubs took control of the division
by winning the four-game series in Milwaukee. In a game moved to
Miller Park on September 14 due to Hurricane Ike, <font color="#556b2f">Zambrano
pitched </font>a no-hitter against the Astros, and six days later the
team clinched the game with a win over St. Louis at Wrigley. The club
finished the season with a 97-64 record and faced Los Angeles in the
NLDS. The heavily favoured Cubs took an early lead in the first game,
but James Loney's grand slam off Ryan Dempster changed the course of
the series. Chicago committed a series of crucial errors and fell to
a 20-6 defeat. The Dodgers took the match, which once again offered a

and the sale of the club to the Ricketts family, the Cubs began their
quest for the NL Central treble by announcing that less would be
invested in contracts than in previous years. Chicago battled <font color="#dcdcdc">St.
Louis </font>for the top spot until August 2009, but the Cardinals
played a furious 20-6 that month and ordered their rivals to battle
it out in the Wild Card race, which they were eliminated from in the

in </font>2009, and were only able to field their opening day
starters three times throughout the season. Third baseman Aramis
Ramírez injured his shoulder in an early May game against the
Milwaukee Brewers, sidelining him until early July and relegating
players like Mike Fontenot and Aaron Miles to more prominent roles.
In addition, key players like Derrek Lee (who still managed to hit
.306 with 35 HRs and 111 RBIs that season), Alfonso Soriano and
Geovany Soto also suffered injuries. The Cubs finished with a winning

miserable 2012 season, losing 101 games (their worst record since
1966), it was largely expected. The rejuvenation movement started by
Epstein and Hoyer began when longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired

Texas at the All-Star break and the replacement of Christian
Villanueva to lead a team of underage prospects. The development of
Castro, Anthony Rizzo, Darwin Barney, Brett Jackson and pitcher Jeff
Samardzija, and the addition of prospects like Javier Baez, Albert

set </font>a record in <font color="#dcdcdc">1930 </font>with 56 home
runs and 190 runs batted in and broke Lou Gehrig's MLB record with
176 RBI. (In 1999, Cooperstown researcher Cliff Kachline discovered a
long-lost extra RBI that had been erroneously attributed to Charlie
Grimm, and historian Jerome Holtzman confirmed it, raising the record
to 191.) As of 2014, the record still stands, and has not been

Greenberg (183). The closest the record has come in the last 75 years
is Manny Ramirez's 165 RBI in <font color="#2f4f4f">1999.</font> In

Roberto Clemente came even closer by hitting a home run to Waveland
Avenue. In 2001, Sammy Sosa's shot hit across Waveland and bounced a
block down Kenmore Avenue. In 1979, Dave Kingman hit a shot that hit
the roof of the third porch on the east side of Kenmore, an estimated
555 feet (169 m), and is considered the longest home run in Wrigley

Company </font>bought it <font color="#2f4f4f">for $20 500 000</font>.
Tribune, which owns the Chicago Tribune newspaper, the Los Angeles
Times, WGN Television, WGN Radio and many other media outlets,
controlled the club until December 2007, when Sam Zell bought the
entire Tribune organization and announced his intention to sell the
baseball team. After a nearly two-year process involving potential
buyers, including a group led by Mark Cuban and Hank Aaron, the
family foundation of TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts won the
bidding at the end of the 2009 season. In the end, MLB owners
unanimously approved the sale and the Ricketts family took control on
27 October 2009.</p>

Clark made his debut at Advocate Health Care on <font color="#2f4f4f">13

installation as the club's first official physical mascot. The bear
cub itself has been used by clubs since the early 1900s, and was the

the Chicago Bears, as the Cubs allowed the football team to play at
Wrigley Field in the 1930s.</p>

Chicago's Lake View neighborhood in </font>an irregular block area
bounded by Clark and Addison Streets and Waveland and Sheffield
Avenues. The area surrounding the ballpark is commonly referred to as
<font color="#dcdcdc">Wrigleyville</font>. The area has a dense
collection of sports bars and restaurants, most of which have
baseball themes, including Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers and The Cubby
Bear. Many of the apartment buildings surrounding Wrigley Field along
Waveland and Sheffield Avenues have built rooftop <font color="#2f4f4f">bleachers
for </font>fans to watch the games, and others sell space for
advertising. One building on Sheffield Avenue has a sign on its roof
that reads &quot;Eamus Catuli!&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;Let's
Go Cubs!&quot;, and another says how long it has been since the last
division championship, pennant and World Series title. 02 means it's
been two years since the 2008 NL Central championship, 65 years since
the 1945 championship and 102 years since the 1908 World Series
championship. On game days, many residents rent out their yards and
driveways to people looking for parking spaces. The uniqueness of the
neighborhood itself is ingrained in the culture of the Chicago Cubs
and Wrigleyville, and has led to it being used for concerts and other
sporting events, such as the 2010 NHL Winter Classic between the
Chicago Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings and the 2010 NCAA men's
football game between the Northwestern Wildcats and Illinois Fighting
Illini.</p>

Bums&quot; is the </font>name given to the fans, many of whom spend
much of the day yelling, who sit in the bleachers at Wrigley Field.
The group was originally called &quot;bums&quot; because it referred
to the group of fans who were present at most games, and because
these games were all-day affairs, it was assumed that they were not
working. Many of these fans were and still are students at
Chicago-area colleges such as DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern
University and Illinois-Chicago. The Broadway play, starring Joe
Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz and James Belushi, ran for
years and was based on the Cub fan group that attended the club's
games. The group was founded in 1967 by dedicated fans Ron Grousl,
Tom Nall and &quot;crazy horn player&quot; Mike Murphy, who was a
sports radio host in broad daylight on Chicago's WSCR AM 670 &quot;The
Score&quot;. Murphy claims that Grousl started the Wrigley tradition
of throwing back home runs by opposing teams. The current team is led
by <font color="#dcdcdc">Derek Schaul </font>(Derek the Five Dollar
Kid). Before the 2006 season, they were upgraded, adding new stores
and a dedicated bar (The Batter's Eye), and Bud Light bought the
naming rights to the bleachers and renamed them <font color="#2f4f4f">the
Bud Light Bleachers</font>. Admission to the Wrigley bleachers is
free, except during playoff games. The stands have been called &quot;the
world's largest beer garden&quot;. A popular T-shirt (sold inside the
park and licensed by the club) with &quot;Wrigley Bleachers&quot; on
the front and &quot;Shut Up and Drink Your Beer&quot; on the back
feeds this stereotype.</p>

mediocrity under pressure, he was competent but vague and typical of
work ethic.&quot; Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed,
but the resentment disappeared several years later when he was flown

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Korea was under Japanese rule from
1910 until the end of the Second World War. In August 1945, the
Soviet Union declared war on Japan and, under an agreement with the
United States, occupied Korea <font color="#a9a9a9">north of the 38th
parallel</font>. <font color="#dcdcdc">US forces </font>later
occupied the south and <font color="#2f4f4f">Japan </font>surrendered.
By 1948, two separate governments had been established. Both
governments claimed to be the legitimate government of Korea, and
neither side accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated
into open warfare when North Korean forces, backed by Soviet and
Chinese forces, invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950. On that day, <font color="#556b2f">the
United Nations Security Council </font>recognised North Korea's act
as an attack and called for an immediate ceasefire. On 27 June, the
Security Council adopted Resolution S/RES/83 on the attack on the
Republic of Korea and decided to form and send a UN force to Korea.

conflict, South Korean forces were on the verge of defeat and were
forced to withdraw <font color="#a9a9a9">to the Pusan Peninsula</font>.
In September 1950, a UN amphibious counter-attack was launched at
Inchon, which cut off many of the North Korean aggressors. Those who
escaped capture and imprisonment were quickly forced back north to
the <font color="#dcdcdc">Chinese </font>border along the Yalu River
or into the mountainous interior. At this point, in October 1950,
Chinese troops crossed the Yalu and entered the war. The Chinese
intervention triggered a withdrawal of UN troops which continued
until mid-1951. After these dramatic turns of events, during which
Seoul changed hands <font color="#2f4f4f">four </font>times, the last
two years of the conflict were a war of attrition, with the front
line <font color="#556b2f">close to the 38th parallel</font>.
However, the air war was never a stalemate. North Korea was subjected
to a massive bombing campaign. Jet fighters met <font color="#6b8e23">in

He noted that he was &quot;faced with the scarcity of immediately

it difficult to reach very far north before Soviet forces could reach

doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this. However,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">An important consideration was the
possible <font color="#a9a9a9">reaction of the Soviet Union in the
</font>event of US intervention. The Truman administration feared
that a war in Korea would be a diversionary attack, escalating into a
general war in Europe when the United States became involved in
Korea. At the same time, 'no one suggested that the United Nations or
the United States could withdraw [from the conflict]'. Yugoslavia - a
potential Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin split - was vital
to the defence of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the
list of 'high risk targets' on the National Security Council's
post-North Korean invasion list. <font color="#dcdcdc">Truman
</font>believed that if aggression was not restrained, a chain
reaction would be set in motion, marginalising the United Nations and
encouraging Communist aggression elsewhere<font color="#dcdcdc">. The
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">UN Security Council </font>approved the
use of force to help the South Koreans, and the United States
immediately began using its <font color="#556b2f">air and naval
forces </font>in the region to that end. However, the administration
refrained from engaging the country because some <font color="#6b8e23">advisers

on and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the

logistical problems with members of various government agencies

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The USAF responded to the MiG-15 by
sending three of the squadron's most capable fighters, the <font color="#a9a9a9">F-86
Sabre</font>. These arrived in December 1950. The MiG was designed <font color="#dcdcdc">as
an anti-bomber fighter</font>. It had a very high flight altitude of
15 000 metres (50 000 feet) and very heavy armament: one 37 mm gun
and two 23 mm guns. They were fast enough to dive past a fighter
escort of P-80 Shooting Stars and F9F Panthers and were capable of
reaching and destroying US heavy bombers. The B-29 losses could not
be avoided, and the Air Force was forced to <font color="#2f4f4f">switch
from a day bombing campaign to the inevitably less accurate night
bombing campaign.</font> The MiGs were counterbalanced by the F-86
Sabres. They had a flight altitude of 13,000 metres (42,000 feet) and
were armed with six 12.7 mm (.50 calibre) machine guns with
adjustable range by radar sights. When approaching at higher
altitudes, the MiG had an advantage whether it was carried or not. In
level flight combat, both winged criminals reached comparable maximum
speeds of around 1 100 km/h (660 mph). The MiG climbed faster, but
the Sabre turned and dived better.</p>

and theft </font>are often associated with copyright infringement.
The original meaning of <font color="#dcdcdc">piracy </font>is
&quot;robbery or illegal violence at sea&quot;, but the term has been
used for centuries as a synonym for copyright infringement. Theft, on
the other hand, emphasises the commercial harm that copyright
infringement may cause to copyright holders. However, copyright is a
form of <font color="#2f4f4f">intellectual property</font>, which is
a separate area of law from robbery or <font color="#556b2f">theft,
which are </font><font color="#6b8e23">only </font><font color="#556b2f">offences
</font><font color="#6b8e23">relating to tangible property. </font>Not
all copyright infringements result in commercial losses, and the US
Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that copyright infringement cannot be

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The practice of calling the
infringement of exclusive rights to creative works &quot;piracy&quot;
predates the introduction of copyright legislation. Prior to Anne's
Law of 1710, the London Stationers' Company was granted a Royal
Charter in 1557, which <font color="#a9a9a9">gave the </font>company
<font color="#dcdcdc">a monopoly on publishing and charged it with
enforcing the Charter.</font> Charter-breakers were called pirates as
early as 1603. The term &quot;piracy&quot; has been used to refer to
the unauthorised copying, distribution and sale of copyright works.
Article 12 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Works of 1886 uses the term &quot;piracy&quot; <font color="#2f4f4f">in
relation to copyright infringement </font>and states that &quot;pirated
works may be <font color="#556b2f">seized on importation into </font>the
countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal
protection&quot;. Article 61 of the <font color="#6b8e23">1994
Agreement on </font>Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS Agreement) provides for criminal proceedings and
penalties in cases of &quot;intentional trademark counterfeiting or
copyright piracy on a commercial scale&quot;. Piracy traditionally
refers to copyright infringements committed intentionally for
financial gain, although more recently copyright holders have called
online copyright infringement, in particular <font color="#a0522d">peer-to-peer
file sharing, </font>piracy.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Copyright holders often call
copyright infringement theft. In copyright law, infringement does not
mean the theft of physical objects that deprives the owner of
control, but the <font color="#a9a9a9">unauthorised</font> use of a
copyright holder's exclusive right. The courts have distinguished
between <font color="#dcdcdc">copyright infringement and theft.</font>
For example, in Dowling v. United States (1985), the US Supreme Court
held that bootleg records were not stolen property. However,
&quot;copyright infringement cannot easily be equated with <font color="#2f4f4f">theft,
conversion or fraud. </font><font color="#556b2f">Copyright law </font>even
uses a separate term to define a copyright infringer: '[...]
copyright infringer'.&quot; The court found that copyright
infringement is a violation of the copyright owner's guaranteed
province under copyright law - <font color="#6b8e23">certain
exclusive rights </font>- but does not involve a physical or other
seizure of the copyright, nor does it completely deprive the
copyright owner of the right to use the copyrighted work or to
exercise the exclusive rights in his possession.</p>

Millennium Copyright Act </font>(1998) and the European E-Commerce
Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited legal
immunity from copyright infringement. Online intermediaries who host
infringing content are not liable if they are unaware of the
infringement and take action when the infringing content is brought
to their attention. In US law, this is known as the <font color="#dcdcdc">safe
harbor </font>provisions. In EU law, the principles for ISPs are
&quot;<font color="#2f4f4f">mere conduit</font>&quot;, meaning that
they are neutral &quot;conduits&quot; that do not know what they are
transmitting, and &quot;<font color="#556b2f">no duty to monitor</font>&quot;,

monitor content. These two principles are an obstacle to certain

themselves <font color="#a9a9a9">host or transmit infringing content,
</font>but some courts have found that they can be seen as
encouraging, enabling or facilitating infringement by users. Examples
of such intermediaries include the creators, publishers and marketers
of peer-to-peer software and websites through which users can
download such software. In the case of the BitTorrent protocol,
intermediaries may include the torrent tracking system and any
website or search engine that facilitates access to torrent files.
Torrent files do not contain <font color="#2f4f4f">copyrighted
content</font>, but may refer to files that do and may refer to
tracking services that coordinate the distribution of these files.
Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as <font color="#556b2f">The

direct links to torrent files, creating another level of deception;
such links are used to obtain torrent files from other peers rather

histories of any country and is considered the cradle of Western
civilisation, and as such is the birthplace of democracy, Western
philosophy, the Olympic Games, Western literature, historiography,
political science, the main scientific and mathematical principles,
and Western drama, including tragedy and comedy. Greece was first
united under <font color="#a9a9a9">Philip of Macedon in the </font>fourth

conquered much of the ancient world and spread Greek culture and

annexed <font color="#2f4f4f">to Rome </font>in the second century BC
and became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor,
the Byzantine Empire. In the <font color="#556b2f">first century AD,
</font>the Greek Orthodox Church was founded, shaping the modern
Greek identity and transmitting Greek traditions to the wider
Orthodox world. Greece came under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th
century, and the modern nation-state was born in <font color="#6b8e23">1830

had also made territorial gains in the Balkans and Eastern Europe

Persian forces captured Athens, which had been evacuated in time, and
briefly conquered half of Greece. After decisive Greek victories at
Salamis, Plataea and Mycale in 480 and 479 BC, the Persians were
forced to retreat for a second time, marking their final withdrawal
from all their European territories. The victories of the Greeks

admired Greek things. The Roman Emperor <font color="#6b8e23">Nero

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Greek-speaking communities of
the Hellenized East played a central role in the spread of early
Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and the early leaders and
writers of Christianity (especially St Paul) were mostly
Greek-speaking, though not usually from Greece itself. The New
Testament is written in <font color="#a9a9a9">Greek, </font>and some
of its passages (Corinthians, Thessalonians, Philippians, Revelation
of John of Patmos) testify to the importance of Greek churches in
early Christianity. Much of Greece, however, held fast to <font color="#dcdcdc">paganism</font>,
and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue at the end
of the 4th century AD, when they were banned by the Roman Emperor
<font color="#2f4f4f">Theodosius I </font>in 391-392. <font color="#556b2f">The

well into the 6th century AD and even later. Many consider it a sign
of the end of antiquity that the Emperor <font color="#6b8e23">Justinian
</font>closed the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens in 529, although
there is evidence that the Academy continued to function for some
time afterwards. Some remote areas, such as the south-eastern

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As the new <font color="#a9a9a9">polyphony

resisted any change. Therefore, Byzantine music remained <font color="#dcdcdc">monophonic

despite certain attempts by some Greek singers (such as Manouel
Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis),
Byzantine music lacked the elements that in the West contributed to
the unhindered development of the art. However, this method, which
kept music from being polyphonic, and the continuation of culture
over the centuries, allowed monophonic music to develop to its

the life and struggles of the Byzantine Empire's Acrites (frontier
guards), the most famous of which are the stories of Digenes Akritas.
The Cleisthenes cycle emerged between the late Byzantine period and
the beginning of the Greek War of Independence. <font color="#2f4f4f">Cleisthenics</font>,
together with historical songs, paralogs (narrative songs or

Ptolemy's Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek
Kingdom. Many Greeks emigrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and
many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the
political unity of the Alexander Empire could not be maintained, it
led to Hellenistic civilisation and the spread of the Greek language

Company</font>. In <font color="#dcdcdc">1833, the </font>founder's

sell shells to </font><font color="#556b2f">London </font><font color="#2f4f4f">collectors</font>.
While collecting shell samples in the Caspian Sea in 1892, the
younger Samuel realised the <font color="#6b8e23">potential of
exporting lamprey oil from </font>the region and ordered the world's
first purpose-built oil tanker, the Murex (Latin for snail shell), to
enter this market; by <font color="#a0522d">1907 the </font>company
had a fleet. Although the company had a refinery at Shell Haven on
the <font color="#191970">Thames </font>for <font color="#228b22">several
decades</font>, there is no evidence that the name came from there.</p>

The downstream business, which in some countries also included oil
refining, generally included a network of retail stations, the
manufacture and marketing of lubricants, the sale of industrial fuels
and lubricants, and many other product and market sectors such as LPG
and bitumen. Shell's practice was that these businesses were
essentially <font color="#a0522d">local </font>and were best managed
by local 'operating companies', often with middle and senior
management reinforced by expatriate employees. This pattern began to
change in <font color="#228b22">the 1990s, with the </font><font color="#191970">independence
of companies around the world gradually being reduced</font>. Today,
<font color="#8b0000">almost all </font>Shell's various businesses

the muscular diaphragm, which separates the thorax from the abdominal
cavity, forming a dome that is convex towards the chest. Contraction
of the diaphragm <font color="#a9a9a9">flattens the dome</font>,

the diaphragm, forcing air out more quickly and forcefully. The

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Mammalian hair, also known as a
<font color="#a9a9a9">covering</font>, can vary in colour <font color="#dcdcdc">between
populations, between organisms within a population and even between
individual organisms</font>. Variation in <font color="#2f4f4f">light
and dark colour </font>is common <font color="#556b2f">in mammalian
taxa</font>. Sometimes this colour variation is due to age variation,
but in other cases it is due to other factors. Mammalian colour
variation is often driven by selective pressures, such as ecological
interactions with other populations or environmental conditions.
These selective pressures favour certain colours <font color="#6b8e23">to
increase survival</font>. Camouflage is thought to be one of the main
selective pressures shaping mammalian colouration, although there is
also evidence that <font color="#a0522d">sexual selection,
communication and physiological processes </font>may also influence
the evolution of colouration. Camouflage is the most dominant
mechanism of colour variation, as it helps organisms to hide from
predators or prey. Fur colouration can also serve as intraspecific
communication, such as warning species members of predators,
indicating health for reproductive purposes, mother-child
communication and deterring predators. Studies have shown that in
some cases, differences in female and male fur colour can indicate
nutritional information and hormone levels that are important in the
mate selection process. One final mechanism for variation in coat
colour is physiological responses, such as temperature regulation in
tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed
about colour variation, much of the genetic factors that link coat
colour to genes remain unknown. Gene loci where pigment genes are
present are known to affect phenotype by 1) altering the spatial
distribution of coat pigmentation and 2) altering the density and
distribution of hairs. Quantitative trait mapping aims to better
understand the distribution of loci that cause pigment variation.
Although the gene loci are known, much remains to be learned about
how these genes are expressed.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Maintaining a high and stable body
temperature is energy-intensive, so mammals need <font color="#dcdcdc">a
nutritious and rich diet</font>. The earliest mammals were probably
predators, but since then different species have adapted in many
different ways to meet their nutritional requirements. Some eat other
animals - this is a carnivorous diet (and includes an insectivorous
diet). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. Herbivore diets
include subtypes such as fruit and grass eaters. An omnivore <font color="#2f4f4f">eats
both prey and plants. </font>Carnivores have a <font color="#556b2f">simple
digestive system because the </font>proteins, lipids and minerals in
meat require little specialised digestion. Plants, on the other hand,
contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. The digestive tract
of a herbivore therefore contains <font color="#6b8e23">bacteria that
</font>ferment these substances and make them available for
digestion. The bacteria are located either in <font color="#a0522d">the
multi-chambered stomach or in the large </font>cecum. The <font color="#228b22">size
of </font><font color="#191970">the animal </font>also influences the
type of food. Because small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing
surface area to heat-producing volume, their energy requirements tend
to be high and their metabolic rate high. Mammals weighing less than
500 grams are mostly insectivores because they cannot tolerate the
slow and complex digestive process of herbivores. Larger animals, on
the other hand, produce more heat, and less of this heat is lost.
They therefore tolerate either a slower harvesting process (those
that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestion process
(herbivores). In addition, mammals weighing more than 500 grams (18
oz) are generally unable to forage during waking hours for enough
<font color="#8b0000">insects </font>to live on. The only large
insectivores are mammals that eat huge insect colonies (ants or
termites).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The deliberate or accidental
cross-breeding of two or more closely related animal species through
captive breeding is a human activity that has been practised for
thousands of years and has recently increased for economic reasons.
The number of successful hybrids between mammals is relatively small,
although it is known that there is a significant number of naturally
occurring crosses between forms or regional varieties of a single
species, which can form what are known as interbreeding<font color="#a9a9a9">
zones.</font> The distinction between some hitherto distinct species
may become blurred when it can be shown that they can not only
reproduce but also produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals
have more strength and stamina than either parent. This is called
<font color="#dcdcdc">hybrid vigour</font>. This is evidenced by the
fact that the mule (sire of the donkey, dam of the horse) has been
widely used as a hardy draft animal in ancient and modern history.
Other well-known examples include the lion/tiger cross, the <font color="#2f4f4f">liger,
</font>by far the largest big cat and sometimes used <font color="#556b2f">in
circuses</font>, and bovine hybrids such as the European/Indian
domestic cattle or the domestic cattle/American bison, used in the
meat industry and marketed as <font color="#6b8e23">Beefalo.</font>
It has been speculated that the donkey itself could be the result of
an ancient cross between two species or subspecies of wild donkey.
Hybrid animals tend to be infertile partly because <font color="#a0522d">their
parents tend to have slightly different numbers of chromosomes</font>,
resulting in their cells having unpaired chromosomes, which prevents
gamete division and proper gonadal function, especially in males.
There are exceptions to this rule, particularly where the speciation
process has been relatively recent or incomplete, as in many species
of cattle and dogs. Normally, <font color="#228b22">behavioural
traits, natural hostility, natural ranges and differences in
reproductive cycles </font>maintain the separation of closely related
species and prevent natural interbreeding. However, widespread
disruption of natural animal behaviour and ranges by human
activities, cities, food dumps, agriculture, fences, roads and so on,
forces animals that would not normally breed together. There are
clear examples of this between the different subspecies of North
American gray wolf, coyote and domestic dog. Because many birds and
mammals are the offspring of their mothers and close relatives from
infancy, the practice used by animal crossbreeders is to breed the
parent designed in the crossbreeding program with the same species as
the one with which it is intended to mate.</p>

<font color="#a9a9a9">1 400 tonnes of </font>opium <font color="#a9a9a9">a

led to the first Opium War (<font color="#556b2f">1839-42)</font>.
After the war, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty
of Nanking, and the Chinese market was opened up to opium traders
from Britain and other countries. Jardines and Apcar and Company
dominated the trade, although P&amp;O also tried to gain a share. The
Second Opium War between Britain and <font color="#6b8e23">France
</font>against China lasted from 1856 to 1860 and led to the Treaty
of Tientsin, which legalised opium imports. Legalisation boosted
China's domestic opium production and increased imports of opium from
Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market
led India to reduce its opium production and diversify its exports.</p>

similar or uncommon characters </font>are commonly borrowed or
substituted to represent a particular morpheme. Examples include
&quot;beautiful&quot; (<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">美 </font>bí is
the written form), whose vernacular morpheme suí is represented by
signs such as <font face="ＭＳ 明朝">媠 </font>(an obsolete

example, the Hokkien word bah (&quot;meat&quot;) has been reduced to
<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">肉</font>, which has etymologically

is the word &quot;eat&quot;, chia̍h, which is often written in

of professional wrestling became an open secret as <font color="#a9a9a9">prominent
figures in the wrestling business (such as WWE owner Vince McMahon)
</font>began to publicly admit that wrestling was entertainment, not
competition. <font color="#dcdcdc">This public revelation has sparked
mixed reactions in the wrestling community, with </font>some
believing that the revelation ruins the spectator experience, as
illusionism does. Despite the public acknowledgement of professional

regulate professional wrestling like other competitive sports</font>.
For example, New York State still regulates 'professional wrestling'
through the New York State Athletic Commission (SAC).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Professional wrestling shows can be
seen as a kind of circular theatre, where the ring, the ring area and
the entrance form the stage. However, the concept of the fourth wall
is much more limited than in most theatrical performances. <font color="#a9a9a9">The
performers recognise and acknowledge the audience as spectators of
the </font>sporting event they are describing, and are encouraged to
act as such. <font color="#dcdcdc">This leads to active audience

achieves the highest number of kills, surrenders or eliminations

matches were wrestled to three falls (&quot;best 2 out of 3 falls&quot;)

modern matches, the standard is one fall.</font> Although it is still
the standard today, many announcers state this explicitly (e.g. &quot;The

These matches are given a time limit; if there <font color="#556b2f">are
not enough falls by the end of the time limit, the match is declared

a qualification system may be used. Any wrestler against whom a fall
has been made will be <font color="#a9a9a9">eliminated from the
match, and the </font>match will continue until only one wrestler
remains. However, when there are more than two wrestlers in a match,
it is much more common for the match to <font color="#dcdcdc">be

received the knockdown, regardless of who it was against. </font>In
championship matches, this means that unlike in one-on-one matches

<font color="#2f4f4f">does not have to be eliminated or participate

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Many modern special matches have
been developed with unique winning conditions. The <font color="#a9a9a9">most
common of these is the ladder match</font>. <font color="#dcdcdc">In
a basic match, wrestlers or groups of wrestlers must climb a ladder
to obtain a prize that is raised above the ring. The </font>key to
winning the match is that <font color="#2f4f4f">a wrestler or
wrestling team must try to incapacitate each other long enough for
one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure the prize for his team.</font>
Thus, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include, but are
not limited to, a <font color="#556b2f">championship belt
</font>(traditional prize), a document entitling the winner to a
future championship match, or any document of significance to the
wrestlers participating in the match (for example, a document giving
the winner a cash prize). Another common special match is known as a
battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring,
with <font color="#6b8e23">20 to 30 wrestlers </font>in the ring at a
time. Once the match begins, the objective is simply to throw the
opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the
floor in order to eliminate the opponent. The last wrestler standing
is declared the winner. A variation of this type of match is the WWE
Royal Rumble, where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match,
and the other wrestlers follow every 90 seconds (previously 2
minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring. All other rules
remain the same. For more match types, see Professional Wrestling
Match Types.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since referees have a legitimate
role in wrestling as liaison between the behind-the-scenes
accountants and the wrestlers in the ring (the role of the final
arbiter is only kayfabe), the referee is also present in matches that
at first sight do not seem to require a referee (such as a match of
darts, since there are no obstacles and the criteria for victory can
theoretically be judged from a distance). Although <font color="#a9a9a9">their
actions are often scripted for dramatic effect</font>, referees are
subject to certain general rules and requirements in order to
maintain a theatrical appearance of impartial authority. <font color="#dcdcdc">The
basic rule is that the referee must see the act in order to declare
it overturned or disqualified. </font>This allows the heel characters
to gain a scripted advantage <font color="#2f4f4f">by interfering
with or obstructing the referee's actions so that they can perform
some seemingly illegal act on their opponent. </font><font color="#556b2f">Most
referees are anonymous and essentially anonymous, although WWE has

exception to this rule: pin attempts interrupted by other wrestlers.
In matches involving multiple wrestlers (such as triple threat
matches or tag team matches), wrestlers who see a pin attempt that,
if successful, would result in the loss of the match are expected to
run in and break up the pin attempt by making some sort of offensive
move on the wrestler attempting the pin attempt. The most common
attacks to break pins are <font color="#dcdcdc">back stomps and
elbows to the back of the head, as they are </font>easily executed on
the spur of the moment. However, these simple moves leave the pinned
wrestler pinned on top of the pinned wrestler. Despite the fact that

factor in professional wrestling, but after the submission-oriented
catch-as-catch-can style of wrestling had declined from mainstream
professional wrestling, submission had largely faded until the rise
of the legitimate sport of <font color="#a9a9a9">mixed martial arts</font>.
Despite this, some wrestlers, such as Chris Jericho, The Undertaker,
Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, Ken Shamrock, Dean Malenko, Chris
Benoit and Tazz, became famous for winning matches <font color="#dcdcdc">by
submission. </font>A wrestler with a distinctive submission technique
is described as being better at applying the hold, making it more
painful or difficult to release than others who use it, or may be
mistaken for being the inventor of the hold (such as when Tazz
popularised kata ha jime judo in professional wrestling under the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Since all contact between wrestlers
must cease <font color="#a9a9a9">if any part of the body touches the
ropes or is under the ropes, </font>many wrestlers try to break their
sense of submission <font color="#dcdcdc">by deliberately grabbing
the ropes</font>. This is called &quot;breaking the rope&quot; and is
one of the most common ways to break the submission hold. Most holds
leave <font color="#2f4f4f">an arm or leg </font>free so that the
person can break free if they wish. Instead, they use these free
limbs to either grab onto one of the ring ropes (the bottom rope is
the most common because it is closest to the wrestlers, although
other ropes are sometimes used for standing holds, such as Chris
Masters' Master Lock) or to pull their foot over or under the rope.
Once this is done and witnessed by the referee, the referee will call
for the offending wrestler to break the hold and will start counting
to five if the wrestler does not do so. If the referee <font color="#556b2f">counts
to five and </font>the wrestler still does not break the hold, he is

ten seconds, in Japan twenty)</font>. <font color="#556b2f">If no one

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In practice, not all infringements
of the rules will result in a match being abandoned, as the referee
can use his discretion and is not obliged to stop the match.
Generally, the only offences that the referee will see and
immediately disqualify (as opposed to multiple offences) are <font color="#a9a9a9">low
blows, use of weapons, harassment or assault on the referee</font>.
In WWE, the referee <font color="#dcdcdc">must see the infraction
with his own eyes to </font>decide that the match ends in
disqualification (simply watching the video tape is usually not
enough), and the referee's decision is almost always final, although
<font color="#2f4f4f">Dusty Finishes </font>(named after Dusty Rhodes
and made famous by him) often result in the referee's decision being
overturned. It is not uncommon for referees themselves to be knocked
out during a match, commonly referred to by the term &quot;<font color="#556b2f">ref
bump</font>&quot;. While the referee is &quot;unconscious&quot;,
wrestlers are <font color="#6b8e23">free to break the rules until </font>the
referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, the referee may
disqualify a person on the assumption that the wrestler knocked him
out; most referee knockouts are staged to give the wrestler, usually
the heel, the advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into
the referee at a slower pace, causing the referee to fall for a short
period of time; in that interim, another wrestler may kill his
opponent with three counters and would have won the match, but the
referee would have fallen (sometimes another referee will run into
the ring from backstage to try for a count, but by then the other
wrestler will have had enough time to kick out on his own).</p>

both opponents are disqualified simultaneously </font>(such as by
countout or if the referee loses complete control of the match and
both opponents attack each other without considering that they are in
the match, such as Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker in Unforgiven in
2002), neither opponent is able to answer ten counts, or both
opponents win the match simultaneously. The latter can happen if, for
example, one opponent's shoulders touch the mat while holding onto
the other opponent's submission hold. If the opponent in the hold
starts clapping at the same time as the referee counts three to
secure the opponent in the hold, both opponents have legally achieved
the scoring conditions simultaneously. Traditionally, the
championship <font color="#2f4f4f">may not change hands in the event
of a tie </font>(although the championship may remain vacant),
although some organizations, such as the TNA, have adopted rules that
allow a champion to forfeit the title by vacating it. A variation of
the draw is the time-limited draw, where there is no winner by a

such as Angelo Poffo, Ernie Ladd, Verne Gagne, Bret Hart and Randy
Orton. Others may keep a single ring name throughout their career
(such as Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, CM Punk and Ricky Steamboat)
or change it from time to time to better suit the demands of the
audience or company. Sometimes the character is owned by the company
and trademarked, forcing the wrestler to find a new character when he
leaves (although this can usually be circumvented by a simple <font color="#a9a9a9">font
change</font>, such as changing Rhyno to Rhino), and sometimes the
character is owned by <font color="#dcdcdc">the wrestler. </font>Sometimes
the wrestler can <font color="#2f4f4f">change his real name </font>to
gain ownership of his ring name (examples include Andrew Martin and
Warrior). Many wrestlers (such as The Rock and The Undertaker)
identify strongly with their character, and even match the name
publicly or among friends. In fact, it is actually considered good
practice for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other <font color="#556b2f">by
their stage names/characters </font>rather than their birth or legal
names, unless otherwise stated. The popularity of a professional
wrestling figure can grow to the point where it appears in other

other unpleasant characteristics known as a heel). In recent years,
however, antagonists have also become prominent in professional
wrestling. There is also the rarer role of the &quot;<font color="#556b2f">in-betweener&quot;</font>,
who is neither fully a face nor fully a heel, but can still play both
roles effectively (an example being Samoa Joe during his first TNA

sudden, unexpected event, or it may develop slowly over time. Almost
always it occurs through a marked change in the character's
behaviour. Some reversals become defining moments in a wrestler's
career, as happened when Hulk Hogan turned <font color="#dcdcdc">heel
</font>after being the number one face for over a decade. Others may
have no discernible impact on the character's status. If a character
repeatedly switches between face and heel, it reduces the impact of
such changes and can lead to audience apathy. <font color="#2f4f4f">Vince

changes than anyone else in WWE history.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As with personas in general, the
orientation of a character's face or heel can change over time or
remain the same throughout their life (the most famous example of the
latter is <font color="#a9a9a9">Ricky Steamboat</font>, a WWE Hall of
<font color="#a9a9a9">Famer </font>who remained a babyface throughout
his career). Sometimes a character's heel becomes so popular that
eventually the public's reaction changes the character's heel-face
cycle so that the heel effectively becomes a face character and what
was previously a face character becomes a heel character, such as
when Dwayne Johnson started using &quot;The Rock&quot; as his heel
character instead of his original &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">Rocky
Maivia&quot; </font>babyface character. Another legendary example is
Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was originally booked <font color="#2f4f4f">as
a regular character who used to </font>drink on the job, use
profanity, break into company property and even break into people's
private homes. To the surprise of the WWF, however, fans enjoyed
Austin's antics so much that he became one of the <font color="#556b2f">biggest

However, the NWA stopped recognising Burke as Women's World Champion

styles is due to the fact that the sport developed independently in
Mexico from the 1930s and that wrestlers in the cruiserweight
division (peso semicompleto) are often the most popular wrestlers in
Mexican lucha libre. Wrestlers often perform the high-altitude moves
characteristic of lucha libre by using the ropes of the weightlifting
ring to catapult towards their opponents, using complex combinations
in rapid succession and applying complex submission moves. Lucha
libre is also known as <font color="#556b2f">tag team wrestling,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The style of Japanese professional
wrestling (puroresu) is again different. It has its roots in the
traditional American style of wrestling and is still part of the same
genre, but it has become its own entity. Despite the fact that the
<font color="#a9a9a9">outcome of the matches is predetermined,
</font>similar to its American counterpart, the phenomena differ <font color="#dcdcdc">in
terms of the psychology and presentation of the sport</font>; it is
considered a full-contact combat sport because it mixes <font color="#2f4f4f">hard
martial arts strikes with shooting-style submission moves, whereas </font>in
the United States it is considered more of an entertainment show.
Wrestlers use kicks and strikes from martial arts, with a strong
emphasis on submission wrestling, and unlike in the US, Japan does
not use such elaborate storylines, but instead puts more emphasis on
the concept of <font color="#556b2f">fighting spirit</font>, meaning
that the physical and mental stamina of the wrestler is valued much
more than the theatrics. Many Japanese wrestlers, including top stars
such as Shinya Hashimoto, Riki Choshu and Keiji Mutoh, came from
<font color="#6b8e23">legitimate </font>martial arts backgrounds, and
many Japanese wrestlers began to make careers in the 1990s in
mixed-sport organisations such as Pancrase and Shooto, which at the
time retained the original look of puroresu but were real
competitions.</p>

top wrestlers have gained a <font color="#a9a9a9">reputation in
mainstream society</font>. Each successive generation has produced
several wrestlers who have extended their careers <font color="#dcdcdc">into
music, acting, writing, business, politics or public speaking </font>and
who are familiar to those unfamiliar with wrestling in general.
Similarly, celebrities from other sports or general pop culture have
also become involved in wrestling for short periods. A good example
of this is The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection <font color="#2f4f4f">of
the </font>1980s, which <font color="#2f4f4f">combined wrestling and

wrestlers, such as Ready to Rumble, ¡Mucha Lucha!, Nacho Libre and
the Santo film series. In Rocky III, the hugely popular Rocky film
series about the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa, the hero fought in a
&quot;boxer vs. wrestler&quot; exhibition match against the huge and
vicious wrestler &quot;Thunderlips&quot;, played by future real-life
wrestling icon Hulk Hogan. At least two plays set in the world of
professional wrestling have been produced. From Parts Unknown. is a
Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler,
nominated for an award. The 2009 South Park episode <font color="#556b2f">&quot;W.T.F.&quot;
</font>played with the soap opera elements of professional wrestling.
One of the main characters in the Disney Channel's Kim Possible
series was a big fan of professional wrestling and featured it in an
episode (two former WWE wrestlers voiced the two fictional wrestlers
in the episode). The 2008 film <font color="#6b8e23">The Wrestler,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, this was not always the
case; in the early 20th century, as it became apparent that 'sport'
was being practised, professional wrestling <font color="#a9a9a9">came
to be seen as a cheap entertainment for the untrained working class </font>-
and this attitude still exists to varying degrees. The French
theorist Roland Barthes was among the first to suggest in his essay
<font color="#dcdcdc">'The World of Wrestling' </font>in his book
Mythologies, first published in <font color="#2f4f4f">1957, </font>that
wrestling was worthy of a more in-depth analysis. Barthes argued that
wrestling should not be seen as a con of the ignorant but as a
spectacle, a theatrical performance for a willing, if bloodthirsty,
audience. Wrestling is described as a performance art that requires
an immediate reading of parallel meanings. This logical conclusion is
the least important of the theatrical performances of the wrestlers
and the referee. According to Barthes, the wrestler's task is not to
win, but to perform exactly the movements expected of him and to
offer the audience a <font color="#556b2f">theatrical spectacle.</font>
This work is considered the basis for all subsequent research.</p>

often simplistically described as <font color="#a9a9a9">a &quot;men's
soap opera&quot;</font>, it has also been said to fulfil the role of
<font color="#dcdcdc">past literary and theatrical forms; it is a
</font>synthesis of classical heroic works, commedia dell'arte,
revenge tragedies, morality plays and burlesque. The characters and

used in the exposure equations to find suitable exposure parameters.
The photographer has four variables at his disposal to achieve the
desired effect: <font color="#dcdcdc">lighting, film speed, f-number
(aperture size) and shutter speed (exposure time)</font>. The
equation can be expressed in ratios, or by taking the logarithm of
both sides (base 2), adding up using the <font color="#2f4f4f">APEX
system, </font>where each increment of 1 represents a doubling of
exposure; this increment is commonly called a <font color="#556b2f">&quot;</font><font color="#6b8e23">stop</font><font color="#556b2f">&quot;.
The </font><font color="#a0522d">effective f-number </font>is
proportional to the <font color="#228b22">ratio between the focal
length of the lens and the aperture diameter</font>, since the
diameter is proportional to the square root of the aperture area.
Thus, a lens with an aperture set at f/1.4 will let <font color="#191970">twice
as much </font>light into the focal length as a lens with an aperture
set at f/2. Thus, any f-number that is the square root of two (about
1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically labeled in this order:
f/1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc.</p>

in New Spain in a way not seen elsewhere in the Americas. Spaniards
encountered a society in which the concept of nobility reflected
their own. The Spaniards respected and complemented the native
nobility. In the centuries that followed, holding the title of
nobility in Mexico did not mean that a person had great political
power, as his power was limited, even if he did not accumulate
wealth. The Mexican concept of nobility was not political but rather
a very conservative Spanish social concept based on the value of
family. Most of these families demonstrated their worth by making
fortunes in New Spain outside the city and then spending the proceeds
in the capital, <font color="#a9a9a9">building churches, supporting
charity and building luxurious palatial houses. </font>The desire to

the name, but not an independent municipality). From 1941 to 1970,
the federal district included twelve delegations and Mexico City. In
1970, Mexico City was divided into <font color="#dcdcdc">four

Miguel Hidalgo, Venustiano Carranza and Benito Juárez</font>,
increasing the number of delegaciones to <font color="#556b2f">sixteen</font>.
From then on, the entire Federal District, whose delegaciones had by
then formed almost a single urban area, became de facto synonymous
with Mexico City.</p>

accounts for <font color="#a9a9a9">15.8% of the </font>country's GDP.
According to a study by PwC, Mexico City's GDP was <font color="#dcdcdc">$390
billion</font>, making it the <font color="#2f4f4f">eighth </font>richest
city in the world after Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris,
London and the Osaka/Kobe metropolitan area (and the richest in Latin
America). If the rest of Mexico's economy is excluded, Mexico City
alone would be the 30th largest economy in the world. Mexico City
accounts for the largest share of the country's industrial GDP
(15.8%) and the service sector also accounts for the largest share of
the country's GDP (<font color="#556b2f">25.3%</font>). Because the
South has little non-urban land, most of which is protected by
environmental laws, the Federal District has the smallest share of
agriculture of any federal region in the country. Mexico City's
economy is one of the fastest growing in the world, with GDP set to
double by <font color="#6b8e23">2020</font>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Historically and since prehispanic
times, the Anahuac Valley has been one of the most densely populated
areas in Mexico. When the federal territory was established in 1824,
the urban area of Mexico City extended roughly to the present-day
district of Cuauhtémoc. In the early 20th century, the elite began
to move south and west, and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San
Ángel were incorporated into the growing agglomeration. According to
the 1921 census, <font color="#a9a9a9">54.78% of </font>the city's
population was considered mestizo (a mixture of indigenous and
European), 22.79% European and <font color="#dcdcdc">18.74%
</font>indigenous. This was the last Mexican census in which people
were asked to declare themselves as belonging to a non-Indian
heritage. However, the census had the distinctive feature that,
unlike racial/ethnic censuses in other countries, it focused on
cultural heritage rather than race, resulting in a large proportion
of whites identifying themselves as 'mixed heritage' in a cultural
sense. In 1921, Mexico City had <font color="#2f4f4f">less than one
million </font>inhabitants.</p>

Napoleon Napoleon de Napoleon (born 15.15.1945, 15.5.1821</font>) was
a <font color="#2f4f4f">French </font>military and political leader
who rose to prominence during the <font color="#556b2f">French
Revolution </font>and led several successful campaigns during the
Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of France from 1804
to 1814 and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and world
affairs for over a decade, leading France against several alliances
in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and most of his
battles, building a great empire that ruled continental Europe before
its final collapse in <font color="#6b8e23">1815.</font> He is often
considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars
and campaigns are studied in military schools around the world. He
also remains one of the most famous and controversial political
figures in Western history. In civilian politics, Napoleon had a
major long-term impact, bringing liberal reforms to the territories
he conquered, particularly the Netherlands, Switzerland and large
parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal
policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting
legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various
forms in a quarter of the world's legal systems from Japan to Quebec.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Napoleon was born in <font color="#a9a9a9">Corsica
</font>to a relatively modest family of Tuscan nobility. Napoleon
supported the French Revolution from the beginning in 1789 while
serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to
Corsica, but was expelled from the island in <font color="#dcdcdc">1793</font>.
Two years later, he saved the French government from collapse by
firing cannons at the crowds in Paris. The Directory rewarded
Napoleon by giving him command of the Italian army <font color="#2f4f4f">at
the age of 26</font>, when he launched his first military campaign
against <font color="#556b2f">the Austrians and their Italian allies</font>,
achieving several decisive victories that made him famous throughout
Europe. After the defeat of the Allies, he led a campaign in Egypt in
<font color="#6b8e23">1798</font>, conquered and occupied the Ottoman
province after defeating the Mamelukes and, with the discoveries made
by his army, launched modern Egyptology.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">On his return from Egypt, Napoleon
staged a coup d'état in November 1799 and became the first consul of
the Republic. A second victory over the Austrians <font color="#a9a9a9">at
the Battle of Marengo in 1800 </font>secured his political power.
With the Concordat of 1801, Napoleon restored the religious
privileges of the <font color="#dcdcdc">Catholic Church </font>and
kept the lands confiscated by the revolution. The state continued to
appoint bishops and control the Church's finances. <font color="#2f4f4f">Napoleon</font>
extended his political power in France until the Senate proclaimed
him Emperor of France in <font color="#2f4f4f">1804 </font>and
launched the French Empire. Persistent disagreements with the British
meant that France faced a third coalition by 1805. Napoleon crushed
this coalition with decisive victories at the Ulm Campaign and the
historic victory <font color="#556b2f">at the Battle of Austerlitz,
</font>which led to the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire. In
October 1805, however, the Franco-Spanish fleet was destroyed <font color="#6b8e23">at
the Battle of Trafalgar, </font>allowing Britain to impose a naval
blockade on the French coast. In 1806, in retaliation, Napoleon
established the Continental System to cut off continental trade with
Britain. The Fourth Coalition took up arms against him in the same
year because Prussia was concerned about France's growing influence
on the continent. Napoleon knocked out Prussia at the battles of Jena
and Auerstedt, then turned his attention to the Russians and
destroyed them at Friedland in June 1807, forcing the Russians to
accept the Treaty of Tilsit.</p>

summer of 1812. In the resulting campaign, a <font color="#dcdcdc">large

Europe finally culminated in the defeat of Napoleon by the Allied
Grand Army at the Battle of Leipzig in October. The following year,
the Allies invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to
abdicate in April <font color="#6b8e23">1814</font>. He was exiled to
the island of Elba. The Bourbons returned to power and the French
lost most of the territory they had conquered since the revolution.
However, Napoleon fled Elba in February 1815 and regained power. The
Allies responded by forming the Seventh Coalition, which eventually
defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June. Napoleon's
planned escape to the United States was then blocked by the Royal
Navy in July, so he surrendered to the British when other options had
run out. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena
in the South Atlantic. His death in 1821 at the age of 51 was greeted
with shock and sadness across Europe. In 1840, a million people
witnessed his remains being returned to Paris, where they remain in
the Les Invalides museum.</p>

Leoben, followed by the wider Treaty of Campo Formio, gave France
control over most of northern Italy and the Netherlands, and a secret
clause promised the Republic of Venice to Austria. Bonaparte marched
on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1100 years of
independence. He also gave the French permission to plunder treasures

concealing the placement of troops and concentrating his forces on
the &quot;hinge&quot; of the enemy's weakened front. If he could not
use his preferred strategy, he would take a central position and
attack two co-operating troops in their hinge, turn to fight one

influence in French politics grew. He founded two newspapers: one for
the troops of his army and one for distribution in France. The royals
attacked Bonaparte for <font color="#a9a9a9">plundering</font> Italy
and warned that he might become a dictator. In all, Napoleon's troops
took an estimated <font color="#dcdcdc">$45 million </font>in assets
from Italy during his campaign there and another $12 million in
precious metals and jewels; in addition, his troops seized more than
<font color="#2f4f4f">three hundred </font>priceless paintings and
sculptures. Bonaparte sent General <font color="#556b2f">Pierre
Augereau </font>to Paris to lead the coup d'état and purge the
royalists between 4 September and 18 September. This left Barras and
his Republican allies back in power but dependent on Bonaparte, who
began peace negotiations with Austria. The negotiations led to the

returned to Paris in December a hero. He met the new French foreign

did not want to ignore them entirely, so he used imperial power to

assumed that there were around 5 million French voters, so the regime

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the spring of <font color="#a9a9a9">1800,
</font>Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy in
an attempt to surprise the Austrian armies that had retaken the
peninsula while Napoleon was in Egypt.After a difficult crossing of
the Alps, the French army arrived on the plains of northern Italy
with almost no resistance. While one French army approached from the
north, the Austrians were busy with another army stationed in Genoa,
which was besieged by a considerable force. The fierce resistance of
this French army, led by <font color="#dcdcdc">André Masséna, </font>gave
the northern strike force valuable time to carry out its operation
with minimum disruption. After several days of searching for each
other, the two armies finally clashed at the Battle of Marengo on <font color="#2f4f4f">14
June. </font><font color="#556b2f">General </font>Melas had a
numerical advantage, with some 30 000 Austrian soldiers, while
Napoleon commanded <font color="#6b8e23">24 000 </font>French
soldiers. The battle began favourably for the Austrians, whose
initial attack caught the French by surprise and gradually drove them
back. Melas concluded that he had won the battle and withdrew to his
headquarters at about 15.00, leaving his subordinates in charge of
the French pursuit. However, the French lines did not break once
during their tactical retreat; Napoleon rode constantly among the
troops, urging them to stand and fight. In the late afternoon, a full
division led by Desaix arrived on the field, dramatically turning the
tide of the battle. Artillery artillery fire and a lucky cavalry
charge succeeded in destroying the Austrian army, which fled
chaotically across the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving
behind 14,000 wounded. The following day, the Austrian army agreed to
give up northern Italy once again with the Treaty of Alessandria,
which granted them safe passage to friendly territory in exchange for
their fortifications across the region.</p>

However, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens, Napoleon agreed to
appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in those colonies
where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting law
of 20 May was never applied to colonies such as Guadeloupe and
Guyane, although rogue generals and other officials used the excuse
of peace as an opportunity to restore slavery in some of these
places. The 20 May Act formally restored the slave trade in the
Caribbean colonies, but not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an
expedition led by General <font color="#6b8e23">Leclerc to </font>restore
control of Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture
Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when a high level of
disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8,000 French
soldiers left the island, and the slaves declared an independent
republic, which they called Haiti in 1804. Napoleon, seeing that his
colonial efforts had failed, decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana
Territory to the United States, which immediately doubled the size of
the United States. The purchase price of Louisiana was less than
three cents an acre, for a total of $15 million.</p>

Boulogne </font>in northern France. He intended to use these assault
troops to attack <font color="#2f4f4f">England</font>. The attack
never took place, but Napoleon's troops received careful and
invaluable training for future military operations. The men at
Boulogne formed the nucleus of what Napoleon later called <font color="#556b2f">La
Grande Armée</font>. The French army initially numbered around
200,000 men, organised into seven divisions, which were large field
units, each with 36 to 40 guns and able to operate independently
until other armies could come to their aid. A single detachment in a
properly defended position could survive for at least a day without
support, giving the Grande Armée a myriad of strategic and tactical
options for each campaign. In addition to these forces, Napoleon
created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 troops, consisting of two courier
divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of unmounted
dragoons and one light cavalry division, all supported by 24 pieces
of artillery. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of <font color="#6b8e23">350

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">By August 1805, Napoleon had
realised that the strategic situation had fundamentally changed.
Faced with a possible attack by his mainland European enemies, he
decided to strike first and turned his army from the English Channel
<font color="#a9a9a9">to the Rhine.</font> His basic objective was to
destroy the Austrian armies isolated in southern Germany before their
Russian allies arrived. After much secrecy and a feverish march,
<font color="#2f4f4f">200,000 </font>French troops began crossing the
Rhine on <font color="#dcdcdc">25 </font>September on a front of over
260 kilometres. The Austrian commander <font color="#556b2f">Karl
Mack </font>had assembled most of the Austrian army at the fortress
of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon turned his troops to the south-east, and
the Grande Armée executed a skilful wheeling manoeuvre that bypassed
the Austrian positions. The Ulm manoeuvre took General Mack by
complete surprise, as he belatedly realised that his army had been
cut off. After some minor fighting, culminating in the Battle of Ulm,
Mack finally surrendered, realising that there was no way to break
out of the French blockade. With only <font color="#6b8e23">2,000
</font>French casualties, Napoleon had managed to capture a total of
60,000 Austrian soldiers with the rapid march of his army. The Ulm
campaign is widely regarded as a strategic masterpiece and influenced
the development of Schlieffen's plan in the late 19th century. The
striking French land victory was overshadowed by the decisive victory
of the Royal Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October. After
Trafalgar, Britain completely dominated the seas during the
Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the Ulm campaign, French
troops succeeded in capturing <font color="#a9a9a9">Vienna </font>in
November. The fall of Vienna offered the French a huge prize, as they
took possession of <font color="#dcdcdc">100 000 </font>muskets, <font color="#2f4f4f">500
</font>cannons and the intact Danube bridges. At this critical
juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II
decided to fight Napoleon, although some of their subordinates had
reservations. Napoleon sent his army north after the Allies, but then
ordered his troops to retreat so that he could feign serious
weakness. Napoleon, desperate to lure the Allies into battle, gave
every indication in the days before the battle that the French army
was in a sorry state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen hill near
the village of Austerlitz. At the Battle of Austerlitz <font color="#556b2f">in
Moravia on </font><font color="#6b8e23">2 December, </font>he
positioned the French army below the Pratzen hills and deliberately
weakened his right flank, tempting the Allies to launch a major
offensive there in the hope of bringing down the entire French line.
The forced march of Marshal Davout and his III Corps from Vienna
plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. At the same time, a
heavy Allied offensive against the French right weakened the position
of their centre on the Pratzen hills, where Marshal Soult's IV Corps
attacked furiously. With the Allied centre destroyed, the French
swept through both flanks of the enemy, sending the Allies on a
chaotic rout and taking thousands of prisoners in the process. The
battle is often regarded as a tactical masterpiece because it
executed a near-perfectly calibrated but dangerous plan on a par with
Cannae, Hannibal's celebrated victory some 2,000 years earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The first military exercises began
in September 1806. In a remarkable letter to Field Marshal <font color="#a9a9a9">Soult,
</font>Napoleon described in detail the main features of Napoleonic
warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ('the square
battalion'), in which he set out the campaign plan. In the
bataillon-carré system, the various forces of the Grande Armée
marched in unison in close support. If a single unit was attacked,
other units could quickly move in and come to the rescue. Napoleon
invaded Prussia with <font color="#dcdcdc">180,000 </font>troops and
marched quickly to the right bank of the Saale. As in previous
campaigns, his basic objective was to destroy one opponent before
reinforcements from another could change the balance of the war.
Having learned the position of the Prussian army, the French turned
west and overwhelmingly crossed the <font color="#2f4f4f">Saale. In
the </font>duels of Jena and Auerstedt on <font color="#556b2f">14
October, </font>the French defeated the Prussians convincingly and
suffered heavy losses. The Prussian king proved incapable of
effectively leading an army that quickly began to disintegrate, with
several key commanders dead or incapacitated. In what historian
Richard Brooks describes as 'the pinnacle of Napoleonic warfare', the
French managed to capture <font color="#6b8e23">140,000 </font>soldiers,
over 2,000 guns and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in a single
month. The historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian troops:
&quot;Never was the morale of any army more completely broken.&quot;
Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate
with the French until the Russians were given the opportunity to join
the battle.</p>

and stabilisation on both sides, the war resumed in June with a

however, Napoleon finally won an overwhelming victory over the
Russians <font color="#6b8e23">at the Battle of Friedland</font>,
wiping out most of the Russian army in a very bloody battle. The
scale of the defeat prompted the Russians to make peace with the

Napoleon. Napoleon assured the envoy that the Vistula River formed a
natural boundary between French and Russian influence in Europe. On
this basis, the emperors began peace talks in the town of Tilsit
after meeting on the iconic ferry on the River Niemen. The very first

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Alexander came under pressure from
his brother, Duke <font color="#a9a9a9">Constantine, to </font>make

offered the Russians relatively lenient terms - he demanded that
Russia join the continental European system, withdraw its troops from
Wallachia and Moldavia, and cede <font color="#dcdcdc">the Ionian
islands </font>to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh
peace terms to Prussia, despite Queen Louise's incessant appeals.
Napoleon wiped half of Prussia off the map and created a new kingdom
of 1 100 square kilometres called <font color="#2f4f4f">Westphalia.
</font>He then appointed his young brother <font color="#556b2f">Jérôme
as the </font>new ruler of this kingdom. The humiliating treatment of
Prussia in Tilsit led to a deep and bitter rivalry, which escalated
as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's ambitions of
friendship with Napoleon led Napoleon to seriously misjudge his
Russian counterpart's true intentions, and he violated several
provisions of the treaty over the next few years. Despite these

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Unhappy with the change in

Portugal. On <font color="#a9a9a9">17 October 1807, </font><font color="#dcdcdc">24,000
</font>French soldiers led by <font color="#2f4f4f">General Junot
</font>crossed the Pyrenees with the cooperation of the Spanish and
headed towards Portugal to carry out Napoleon's orders. The attack
was the first step in what eventually became the <font color="#556b2f">Peninsular
War</font>, a six-year battle that significantly sapped French
forces. During the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly
involved in Spain's internal affairs and attempted to foment discord
between members of the Spanish royal family. On 16 February 1808, the
French covert intrigues finally came to fruition when Napoleon
announced that he would intervene and mediate between the rival
political factions in the country. Marshal Murat led a force of <font color="#6b8e23">120
000 </font>troops into Spain, and the French arrived in Madrid on 24
March, where wild riots broke out against the occupation just a few
weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as the
new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment infuriated a
strongly religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to
the French invasion soon spread throughout the country. The shocking
defeat of France at the Battle of Bailén in July gave hope to
Napoleon's enemies and partly prompted the French Emperor to
intervene personally.</p>

decided to deal with a number of outstanding problems with the
Russians. <font color="#a9a9a9">At the Congress of Erfurt </font>in
October <font color="#dcdcdc">1808, </font>Napoleon hoped to keep
Russia on his side in the forthcoming battle in Spain and in a
possible conflict with Austria. The parties reached an agreement, the
Treaty of Erfurt, which called on Britain to end its war against
<font color="#2f4f4f">France</font>, acknowledged the conquest of
<font color="#556b2f">Finland </font>from Sweden to Russia, and
confirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against
Austria 'to the best of its ability'. Napoleon then returned to
France and prepared for war. In November 1808, the Grande Armée,
under the personal command of the Emperor, quickly crossed the Ebro
River and inflicted several crushing defeats on the Spanish troops.
Having eliminated the last Spanish troops guarding the capital at
Somosierra, Napoleon invaded Madrid on 4 December with 80 000 troops.
He then unleashed his soldiers on Moore and the British troops. The
British were quickly driven to the coast and withdrew completely from
Spain after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in <font color="#6b8e23">January

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Napoleon eventually decided to leave
the Iberian Peninsula to fight <font color="#a9a9a9">the Austrians </font>in
central Europe, but the Peninsular War continued long after his
absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several
months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula
under the future Duke of Wellington. The war then reached a complex
and asymmetrical strategic impasse, with all sides struggling to gain
the upper hand. The conflict culminated in a brutal guerrilla war
that took over much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed
the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars at this stage of the
conflict. The brutal guerrilla fighting in <font color="#dcdcdc">Spain</font>,
which was largely absent from the French campaigns in central Europe,
seriously disrupted French supply and communication lines. Although
France had some <font color="#2f4f4f">300 000 </font>troops in the
Iberian Peninsula during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were
tied up in garrison and reconnaissance duties. The French were never
able to concentrate all their forces effectively, which prolonged the
war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in
favour of the Allies. After the Russian invasion in <font color="#556b2f">1812,
the </font>number of French troops in Spain was considerably reduced,
as Napoleon needed reinforcements to maintain his strategic position
in Europe. By <font color="#6b8e23">1814</font>, the Allies had

found the Grande Armée in a dangerous situation, its two wings
separated by <font color="#2f4f4f">121 kilometres (75 miles) </font>and
linked by a thin line of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left
wing of the French army and threw his men towards Marshal Davout's

Austrian road with the famous <font color="#556b2f">Landshut
manoeuvre</font>. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his
soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French won a convincing
victory <font color="#6b8e23">at the Battle of Eckmühl, </font>forcing

villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French
bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern
but still controlled Essling. The constant Austrian artillery
bombardment finally forced Napoleon to withdraw his troops back to

his career to date. Neither side made much progress on 5 July, but
the 6th brought the final result. Both sides launched major attacks
on their flanks. Austrian attacks on the French left initially looked
dangerous, but they were all beaten back. At the same time, France's
sustained attack on Austria's left wing eventually jeopardised
Charles' entire position. Napoleon ended the battle with a
concentrated central attack that blew a hole in the Austrian army and
forced Charles to retreat. Austrian casualties were very heavy, well
over 40,000. The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians
immediately, but Napoleon finally caught Charles at Znojmo, and

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font color="#a9a9a9">Napoleon's
educational reforms </font>laid the foundations for the modern
education system in France and much of Europe. Napoleon combined the
best academic elements of the Ancien Régime, the Enlightenment and
the Revolution to create a stable, well-educated and prosperous
society. He made <font color="#dcdcdc">French </font>the only
official language. He left part of primary education in the hands of
religious orders, but provided <font color="#2f4f4f">public support
</font>for secondary education. Napoleon set up a number of state
secondary schools (<font color="#556b2f">lycées) to </font>provide a
standardised education that was uniform throughout France. All pupils
were taught <font color="#6b8e23">science </font>and modern and
classical languages. Unlike under the Ancien Régime, religious
subjects did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present
alongside clerical teachers. Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to
bring social stability. He paid particular attention to progressive
centres, notably the École Polytechnique, which offered both
military expertise and scientific excellence. Napoleon took the first
significant steps towards the creation of a secular and public
education system. The system included scholarships and strict
discipline, and as a result the French education system was superior
to its European counterparts, many of which borrowed from the French
system.</p>
