<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Unlike the fuzzy and relatively
unnatural atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and
visible weather phenomena. For example, at the time of the <font color="#a9a9a9">Voyager
2 </font>flyby <font color="#dcdcdc">in 1989, </font>there was a
<font color="#2f4f4f">large dark spot in the </font>planet's southern
hemisphere<font color="#2f4f4f">, </font>comparable to <font color="#556b2f">the
large red spot </font>on Jupiter. These weather phenomena are driven
by the strongest <font color="#6b8e23">sustained winds in the </font>solar
system<font color="#6b8e23">, reaching </font>speeds of up to <font color="#a0522d">2
100 kilometres per hour </font>(580 m/s). Because of its great
distance, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in
the solar system, with cloud tops reaching temperatures of almost <font color="#228b22">55
K </font><font color="#191970">(-218 °C). </font>At the centre of
the planet, the temperature is around <font color="#8b0000">5 400 K

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Some of the earliest telescopic
observations ever made, the drawings made by <font color="#dcdcdc">Galileo
on </font><font color="#2f4f4f">28 December 1612 </font>and 27
January 1613, contain plotted points corresponding to the currently
known position of Neptune. On both occasions, <font color="#556b2f">Galileo
</font>appears to have mistaken <font color="#6b8e23">Neptune for </font><font color="#a0522d">a
fixed star </font>when it appeared in the night sky near Jupiter, and
is therefore not considered to have discovered Neptune. On the
occasion of his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was
almost stationary in the sky, having just that day turned retrograde.
This apparent retrograde motion occurs when the <font color="#228b22">Earth's
orbit takes it past an outer planet. </font>As <font color="#191970">Neptune
</font>was just starting its annual retrograde cycle, the planet's
motion was far too small to be detected by Galileo's small telescope.
In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist <font color="#8b0000">David
Jamieson </font>reported new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at
least aware that the 'star' he observed was moving relative to the
fixed stars.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In most languages, even in countries
with no direct connection to Greco-Roman culture, the planet is
nowadays referred to by some variant of the name &quot;Neptune&quot;.
In Chinese, Japanese and Korean, however, the name of the planet was
translated as &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">king star of the sea</font>&quot;
(<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">海王星</font>), because Neptune was
the <font color="#dcdcdc">god of the sea. </font>In Mongolian,
Neptune is called <font color="#2f4f4f">Dalain Van, </font>reflecting
the role of its namesake god as ruler of the sea. In modern Greek,
the planet is called <font color="#556b2f">Poseidon </font>(Ποσειδώνας,
Poseidonas), the Greek equivalent of Neptune. The Hebrew &quot;<font color="#6b8e23">Rahab</font>&quot;
(<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">רהב</span></font>), which is
derived from the biblical sea monster mentioned in <font color="#a0522d">the

by a vote administered by the Hebrew Language Academy in 2009,
although the current Latin term &quot;Neptune&quot; (<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">נפטון</span></font>)
is commonly used. In the Māori language, the planet is called
Tangaroa, named after the Māori sea god. In Nahuatl, the planet is
called Tlāloccītlalli, named after the rain god <font color="#228b22">Tlāloc.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The more variable weather compared
to Neptune's Uranus is partly due to its <font color="#a9a9a9">greater
internal warming</font>. Although Neptune is more than <font color="#dcdcdc">50%
</font>further away from the Sun than Uranus and receives only <font color="#2f4f4f">40%
of </font>its sunlight, the surface temperatures of the two planets
are roughly the same. In the upper regions of Neptune's troposphere,
the temperature is 51.8 K (-221.3 °C). At a depth of 1 bar (100
kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (-201.15 °C). Deeper inside the gas
layers, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of
this warming is unknown, but the difference is greater: Uranus
radiates only 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun,
while Neptune radiates about <font color="#556b2f">2.61 </font>times
as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the furthest
planet from the Sun, but it still has enough internal energy to power
the fastest planetary wind observed in the Solar System. Depending on

it has an angular diameter of only <font color="#a9a9a9">2.2-2.4

Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually. Most
telescope data were quite limited until the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO)
came on the market. The <font color="#2f4f4f">first scientifically

shown to be warming up, resulting in increased atmospheric activity
and brightness. With advances in technology, ground-based telescopes
with adaptive optics are capturing increasingly detailed images of
this outer planet. Both HST and AO telescopes on Earth have made many
new discoveries of the Solar System since the mid-1990s, and the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Some <font color="#a9a9a9">trams
</font>used tubular conductors <font color="#dcdcdc">to collect power
from the third rail</font>. The third rail was <font color="#2f4f4f">below
street level</font>. The tram picked up power through <font color="#556b2f">a
plow </font>(U.S. &quot;plow&quot;), which was accessed through a
narrow gap in the road. In the US, much (though not all) of the
former <font color="#6b8e23">Washington </font>streetcar system
(abolished in 1962) operated this way to avoid the unsightly wires
and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true of the
former Manhattan streetcar system. Traces of this mode of operation
can still be seen in central London, UK, on the slope at the north
entrance of the abandoned Kingsway Tramway subway, where the gap
between the rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q streets west of
Wisconsin Avenue in the <font color="#a0522d">Georgetown </font>district
of Washington DC, where the abandoned tracks have not yet been paved.
The gap can easily be mistaken for a similar looking gap in cable
cars (in some cases, the conduit gap was originally a cable gap). The
disadvantages of collecting conduit were much higher <font color="#228b22">initial
installation costs</font>, higher maintenance costs and problems with
<font color="#191970">leaves and snow </font>getting into the
opening. For this reason, <font color="#8b0000">in Washington, D.C.,
the </font>cars on some lines were converted to overhead wires when
leaving the city center, with one worker in the &quot;plow pit&quot;
unhooking the plow while another lifted the car's pole (which was
previously hooked to the roof) into the overhead wire. In New York,
for similar <font color="#483d8b">reasons of cost and operational
efficiency, </font>an overhead cable was used outside Manhattan. A
similar system of switching from tube to overhead conductor was also
used on London trams, particularly in the south; a typical
interchange was at Norwood, where the tube snaked between the side
rails and provided a parking space for loose shoes or ploughs.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The main advantage of a four-rail
system is that <font color="#dcdcdc">neither rail carries current</font>.
This system was introduced because the problem was that the return
currents, which were supposed to be routed through the grounded
(earthed) running rail, instead passed through the iron lining of the
tunnel. This can cause <font color="#2f4f4f">electrolytic damage </font><font color="#556b2f">and
even arcing if </font>the tunnel sections are not electrically
connected. The problem was compounded by the fact that <font color="#6b8e23">the
return current </font>also tended to pass through iron pipes formed
by nearby <font color="#a0522d">water and gas pipes.</font> Some of
these pipes, particularly the Victorian pre-London Underground pipes,
were not designed to carry electricity and did not have adequate
electrical connections between pipe segments. The four-rail system
solves the problem. Although an artificially created earthing point
is provided in <font color="#228b22">the supply system</font>, this
connection is routed through <font color="#191970">resistors</font>,
ensuring that stray currents are kept at manageable levels.
Power-only rails can be mounted on heavily insulating <font color="#8b0000">ceramic
chairs </font>to minimise electrical leakage, but this is not
possible <font color="#483d8b">for contact rails</font>, which must
be mounted on stronger metal chairs to support the weight of the
trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and
the chairs can solve part of the problem by isolating the running
rails from the return of current in the event of a leakage through
the running rails.</p>

neutral sections </font>(also known as <font color="#2f4f4f">phase
breaks)</font>, which are usually placed at and between substations,
although typically only half of them are always in use, and the rest
are positioned so that the substation can be closed and feed power
from adjacent substations. Neutral sections usually consist of a
<font color="#556b2f">section of </font>earthed <font color="#556b2f">conductor
</font>separated from the live wires on either side by insulating
material, usually ceramic beads, designed to allow current collectors
to pass smoothly from one section to the other. <font color="#6b8e23">The
grounded section </font>prevents <font color="#a0522d">the arc from
being drawn from one live section to the other</font>, since the
voltage difference may be greater than the normal voltage of the
system if the live sections are in different phases, and the circuit
breakers may not be able to safely cut off the substantial current
that flows. In order to prevent an arc from being drawn from one
section to the ground, the <font color="#228b22">train </font>shall
be in a rolling mode when passing through the neutral section and the
circuit breakers shall be open to prevent an arc from being drawn
from the other section to the ground. In many cases this is done
manually by the drivers. They are assisted by a <font color="#191970">warning
sign </font>just before the zero section and a pre-warning some
distance before it. After the neutral section, there is another panel
that tells drivers to reset the circuit breaker, but drivers are not
allowed to do so until the rear pantographs have passed this panel.
In the UK, the Automatic Power Control (APC) system <font color="#8b0000">opens
and closes the circuit breaker automatically </font>using permanent
magnets along the track which are connected to a detector on board
the train. All the driver has to do is switch off the <font color="#483d8b">power
and board the train, which </font>is why warning signs are still
present on and approaching neutral sections of track.</p>

AC power from <font color="#a9a9a9">the grid</font>, feed it into the
locomotive and convert it to DC voltage to power the traction motors.
These motors can be either <font color="#dcdcdc">DC motors, which use
DC voltage directly, or three-phase AC motors</font>, which require

Both <font color="#6b8e23">the transmission and the conversion of

compared systems powered by <font color="#a9a9a9">3 kV DC and 25 kV
AC (50 Hz)</font>. The results showed that the percentage losses of
overhead lines (contact wires and contact wires) were more than three
times higher <font color="#dcdcdc">at 3 kV DC </font>than at 25 kV
AC. When all conversion losses were taken into account and added to
the overhead line losses (including energy from cooling fans), the 25
kV AC losses were slightly higher than the <font color="#2f4f4f">3 kV

<font color="#556b2f">3 kV DC </font>was slightly more energy
efficient than AC in supplying power from the Soviet grid to the
traction motor terminals (which were all DC motors at the time). Both
systems used energy to convert the higher <font color="#6b8e23">AC

DC system all the conversion took place (with higher efficiency) at
the railway station, while in the AC system most of the conversion

</font>traction ended up being somewhat more energy efficient than
<font color="#dcdcdc">diesel</font>. Partly due to the inefficient
electricity generation in the Soviet Union (heat efficiency was only
20.8% in 1950 and 36.2% in 1975), the diesel locomotive was about
twice as energy efficient as the electric locomotive in <font color="#2f4f4f">1950
</font>(net tonne-kilometres of freight per kilogram of fuel). As the
efficiency of electricity generation (and hence electric traction)
improved, electric railways became more efficient than diesels by
about <font color="#556b2f">1965. </font>After the mid-1970s,
electric transport consumed about <font color="#a0522d">25% less fuel
per tonne-kilometre</font>. However, diesel was mainly used on
single-track lines with relatively heavy traffic, so the lower fuel
consumption of electric trains may be partly due <font color="#228b22">to
better operating conditions on electrified lines </font>(such as
double-tracks) rather than to inherent energy efficiency. However,
the cost of diesel fuel was about <font color="#191970">1.5 times

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In addition to improvements in power
plant efficiency, the efficiency of electricity use by railways also
increased (between 1950 and 1973), with <font color="#a9a9a9">energy
intensity falling </font>from 218 kwh to 124 kwh/10 000 gross
tonne-kilometres (for both passenger and freight trains), a 43%
reduction. Since energy intensity is the inverse of energy
efficiency, it decreases with increasing <font color="#dcdcdc">efficiency.</font>
However, most of this 43% reduction in energy intensity also
benefited diesel traction. The conversion of wheel bearings from
plain bearings to roller bearings, the increase in train weight, the
conversion of single-track lines to double-track (or partly
double-track) and the removal of obsolete <font color="#2f4f4f">double-axle
freight wagons </font>all increased the energy efficiency of all
traction modes - <font color="#556b2f">electric</font>, diesel and
steam. However, only electric traction (and not diesel) benefited
from a 12-15% reduction in energy consumption. This was due to
improvements in locomotives, the spread of <font color="#6b8e23">regenerative
</font>braking (which in 1989 recycled <font color="#a0522d">2.65% of
</font>the electrical energy used for traction), remote control of
substations, better handling of the locomotive by the crew and
improved automation. Thus, the overall efficiency of electric
traction compared to diesel more than doubled in <font color="#191970">the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The traditional Charleston accent
has long been known in the state and throughout the South. It is
typically heard in wealthy white families whose families have lived
in the city for generations. It has sliding or monophthongal long
middle vowels, ay and aw sounds are stressed in certain environments,
and is not rhotic. <font color="#a9a9a9">Sylvester Primer </font><font color="#dcdcdc">of
the College of Charleston </font>wrote about the local dialect in his
late 19th century works, Charleston Provincialisms (<font color="#2f4f4f">1887</font>)
and The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms, published <font color="#556b2f">in
a German journal.</font> He believed that the accent was based on the
English spoken by the first settlers, which was thus derived from
Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston
speakers. The rapidly disappearing 'Charleston accent' is still
evident in the local pronunciation of the town's name. Some elderly
(and usually upper-class) Charleston residents ignore the r and
stretch the first vowel, pronouncing the name 'Chah-l-ston'. Some
observers attribute these unique features of Charleston speech to the
early settlement of <font color="#6b8e23">French Huguenots and
Sephardic Jews </font>(who were mainly English-speaking Jews from
London), both of whom played an influential role in Charleston's
early development and history[citation needed].</p>

The eight months of bombing never seriously affected British

Blitz bombing was only authorised after the Luftwaffe had failed to
meet the preconditions for the launch of <font color="#a9a9a9">Operation
Sea Lion in </font>1940, Germany's tentatively planned invasion of
Britain. By May 1941, the threat of a British invasion was over, and
Hitler's attention had turned to his Operation Barbarossa in the

caused relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in
<font color="#2f4f4f">July 1943 </font>caused some <font color="#556b2f">42,000

theorists <font color="#a9a9a9">Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell
</font>advocated the idea that air power could win wars on its own
without land and sea battles. It was felt that there was no defence
against air attacks, especially <font color="#dcdcdc">at night</font>.
Enemy industry, government installations, factories and
communications could be destroyed, thus depriving the enemy of the
means of resistance. The bombing of population centres was also
thought to cause <font color="#2f4f4f">a collapse of civilian
civilian opinion, which </font>could have led to the collapse of
production and civilian life. Particularly vulnerable were
<font color="#556b2f">democracies where the </font>people could
openly express their disapproval of the government in power. This
mindset prevailed in both the RAF and the US <font color="#6b8e23">Army

the RAF Bomber Command sought to achieve victory by destroying the

</font>strategic bombing was treated with more restraint. The OKL was
not opposed to strategic bombing of enemy industry and/or cities and
believed that it could significantly affect the balance of power on
the battlefield in Germany's favour by disrupting production and
damaging civilian morale, but it did not believe that air power alone
could be decisive. Contrary to popular belief, the Luftwaffe did not
pursue a systematic policy known as '<font color="#dcdcdc">terror

</font>did not pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as to
protecting against enemy bombing, although he had promoted the
development of bombers <font color="#dcdcdc">in the 1930s </font>and
understood that bombers could be used for important strategic
purposes. He told the OKL in 1939 that the ruthless use of the
Luftwaffe against the heart of the British resistance could and would
happen when <font color="#2f4f4f">the moment was right</font>;
however, he quickly developed a lively scepticism about strategic
bombing, which was confirmed by the results of the lightning strike.
He often lamented <font color="#556b2f">the</font> Luftwaffe's
<font color="#556b2f">inability to damage industry </font>sufficiently

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Ultimately, Hitler was trapped by
his own view of bombing as a weapon of terror, which emerged in the
1930s when he threatened smaller nations to accept German rule rather
than submit to <font color="#a9a9a9">aerial bombardment</font>. This
had important consequences. It showed the extent to which Hitler
personally mistook the Allied strategy for breaking morale rather
than economic warfare, and the collapse of morale was an added bonus.
Hitler was far more interested in the political aspects of the
bombing. Since the mere threat of bombing had produced diplomatic
results in the 1930s, he expected that the threat of German
retaliation would induce the Allies to adopt <font color="#dcdcdc">a
policy of moderation </font>rather than an unrestricted bombing
policy. His hope - because of Germany's internal <font color="#2f4f4f">political
</font>prestige - was that the German population would be protected
from Allied bombing. When this proved impossible, he began to fear
that popular sentiment would turn against his administration, and he
redoubled his efforts to launch a similar 'terror attack' against
Britain in order to <font color="#556b2f">create a stalemate in which
</font>both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The big problem with the Luftwaffe
was <font color="#a9a9a9">Hermann Göring</font>. Hitler believed
that the Luftwaffe was 'the most effective strategic weapon', and in
response to repeated requests from the Kriegsmarine for control of
<font color="#dcdcdc">aircraft</font>, he insisted: 'We would never
have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an
undivided Luftwaffe'. Such principles made it much more difficult to
integrate the air force into the overall strategy and led Goering to
jealously and perniciously defend his 'empire' while Hitler
voluntarily abolished systematic command of the air force at either
the strategic or operational level. Later in the war, when Hitler
attempted to intervene more in the management of the air force, he
found himself in a self-inflicted political conflict between Goering
and himself, which was not fully resolved until the end of the war.
In 1940 and 1941, Goering's refusal to cooperate with <font color="#2f4f4f">the

in 1937 not to pursue Wever's original heavy bomber programme, the

wanted to know the number of bombers, not how many engines each had.

</font>The British produced <font color="#2f4f4f">10 000 </font>aircraft

crews was more difficult. Both the RAF and the Luftwaffe had
difficulty replacing lost crews, although the Germans had larger
reserves of trained aircrew. Circumstances affected the Germans more
than the British. British pilots operating over their home country
could fly again if they survived a shoot-down. German crews were
threatened with <font color="#556b2f">imprisonment </font>even if
they survived. In addition, the bombers had between <font color="#6b8e23">four

Oberkommando der Luftwaffe </font>(OKL) sometimes claims that the
decision to change strategy was a big mistake. It is argued that by
continuing attacks against RAF airfields, the Luftwaffe might have
won air supremacy. Others argue that the Luftwaffe made little impact
on fighter pilot command in the last week of August and the first
week of September and that the change in strategy was not decisive.
It has also been argued that the Luftwaffe could hardly have achieved
air superiority before the &quot;weather window&quot; began to
deteriorate in <font color="#dcdcdc">October</font>. If the RAF's
losses had become severe, it was also possible that it could have
withdrawn <font color="#2f4f4f">north</font>, waited for the German
invasion and then moved south again. Other historians argue that the
outcome of the air battle did not matter; the massive numerical
superiority of the <font color="#556b2f">British navy </font>and the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Initially, it was decided to
concentrate on bombing British industrial cities in daylight. The
main focus of the bombing was on the <font color="#a9a9a9">city of
London</font>. The first major attack in this respect was carried out
on 7 September. On 15 September, the day known as <font color="#dcdcdc">Battle
of Britain Day, </font>a large-scale daylight attack was carried out,
but suffered significant casualties with no lasting gains. Although a
few major daylight air battles were fought later in the month and in
October, the Luftwaffe shifted its main effort to night raids to
reduce losses. This became official policy on 7 October. An air
campaign against London and other British cities was soon launched.
However, the Luftwaffe had its limitations. Its aircraft - Dornier Do
17, Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 - were capable of carrying out
strategic missions, but <font color="#2f4f4f">bomb load restrictions
</font>prevented <font color="#2f4f4f">them </font>from doing much
damage. The Luftwaffe's decision to concentrate on medium bombers
during the interwar period was due to several reasons: Hitler neither
intended nor anticipated war with Britain in 1939; OKL believed that
medium bombers could perform strategic missions as well as heavy
bombers; and Germany did not have the resources or technical
capability to produce <font color="#556b2f">four-engine bombers

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Although the Luftwaffe's equipment

Britain was not to be considered a potential adversary until <font color="#dcdcdc">early
1938</font>. It did not have time to gather reliable intelligence on
British industry. Nor was the OKL in a position to decide on an
appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether Luftwaffe
attacks should target a particular sector of British industry, such
as aircraft factories, or a system of interrelated industries, such
as the British import and distribution network, or even an attack
designed to break the morale of the British population. During the
winter of 1940-1941, the Luftwaffe's strategy became increasingly
aimless. Arguments within the OKL staff were more about <font color="#2f4f4f">tactics

days of Air Chief of Staff Hugh Trenchard in the early 1920s had
stressed that attack was the best means of defence. British defence
strategy was based on offensive action, known as <font color="#a9a9a9">the
offensive cult</font>. To prevent German formations from striking
targets in Britain, the RAF Bomber Command destroyed Luftwaffe
aircraft at their own bases, aircraft at their factories and fuel
depots by attacking oil mills. This philosophy was impractical
because Bomber <font color="#dcdcdc">Command lacked the technology
and equipment </font>and took several years to develop. This strategy
slowed down the development of fighter defence in the 1930s. Dowding
agreed that air defence would require some offensive action and that
fighters alone could not defend Britain. Until September 1940, the

crossed along the He 111's flight path. The first crossbeam served as
a warning to the bomb launcher, who <font color="#556b2f">set off the

controlled a single approach beam along which the bomber followed.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In June 1940, a German prisoner of
war was overheard boasting that the British would never find
<font color="#a9a9a9">Knickebein, </font>even though it was under
their noses. The details of the conversation were passed on to <font color="#dcdcdc">Dr
R. V. Jones, </font>technical adviser to the RAF Air Staff, who began
a thorough investigation which revealed that the Luftwaffe's Lorenz
receivers were more than just blind landing devices. Jones therefore
began a search for German beams. BATDU (Beam Approach Training
Development Unit) Avro Ansons were flown over the upper and lower
reaches of Britain and equipped with <font color="#2f4f4f">a 30 MHz
receiver </font>to detect them. A beam was soon traced to <font color="#556b2f">Derby
</font>(mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions). The first jamming
operations were carried out using confiscated hospital <font color="#6b8e23">telegraphs.</font>
A subtle form of distortion was introduced. Up to nine special
transmitters directed their signals in the direction of the beam in
such a way that the beam path was widened, thus losing its ability to
locate targets accurately. Confidence in the device was undermined
when the Luftwaffe decided to launch large-scale attacks. The
interception operations were carried out by British Electronic
Countermeasures (ECM) units led by Edward Addison, Wing Commander of
the RAF 80th Wing. Generating false radio navigation signals by
retransmitting the original signals was a technique known as masking
beacons (meacons).</p>

medium frequency band, and the signals contained a two-letter Morse
code followed by a long period of time that allowed Luftwaffe crews
to determine the direction of the signal. The Meacon system included
separate locations for a receiver and a transmitter with a
directional antenna. When a German signal was received by the
receiver, it was properly transmitted to the transmitter and the
signal was repeated. This did not guarantee automatic success. If a

once the bombardment had begun over an adjacent target and its
effects had been controlled. Too early, in which case the chances of
success would be reduced; too late, in which case the actual fire on
the target would overwhelm the diversionary fires. Another innovation
was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">From November 1940 to February 1941,
the Luftwaffe changed its strategy and attacked other industrial
cities. The <font color="#a9a9a9">West Midlands in </font>particular
was targeted. On the night of 13-14 November, 77 He 111s of
Kampfgeschwader 26 (26th Bombardment Squadron or KG 26) bombed London
and 63 bombers of KG 55 bombed Birmingham. The following night a
large force struck Coventry. The 12 'pathfinders' of Kampfgruppe 100
(Kampfgruppe 100 or KGr 100) led 437 bombers from KG 1, KG 3, KG 26,
KG 27, KG 55 and Lehrgeschwader 1 (1st Training Squadron or LG 1),
dropping 394 short tons (357 t) of explosives, 56 short tons (51 t)
of incendiary bombs and <font color="#dcdcdc">127 </font>parachute
bombs. According to other sources, 449 bombers were dropped and a
total of 530 short tons (480 t) of bombs. The attack on Coventry was
particularly devastating and led to the widespread use of the term
<font color="#2f4f4f">'conventrate'.</font> Over 10 000 bombs were
dropped. Some 21 factories were seriously damaged in Coventry, and
<font color="#556b2f">the loss of public services </font>halted work
in nine other factories, interrupting industrial production for
several months. Only one bomber was lost to anti-aircraft fire,
although the RAF flew 125 night flights. No further attacks were made
because the OKL underestimated British recovery power (as Bomber
Command did over Germany in 1943-1945). The success of the attack
took the Germans by surprise. The concentration had been achieved by

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Hitler's interest in this strategy
forced Göring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain
in January 1941. This led Göring and Jeschonnek to agree to Hitler's
Directive 23, <font color="#a9a9a9">Instructions for Operations
against the British War Economy, </font>issued on 6 February 1941,
which gave <font color="#dcdcdc">priority to the prohibition of
British imports by air from the sea</font>. This strategy had been
recognised before the war, but <font color="#2f4f4f">Operation Eagle
Attack and the subsequent Battle of Britain </font>had prevented the
destruction of Britain's sea links and diverted the German air force

</font>was the only concession Göring made to the Kriegsmarine on
the Luftwaffe's strategic bombing strategy against Britain. He then
refused to deploy air units to destroy British dockyards, harbours,
harbour installations or ships in dock or at sea to prevent the
Kriegsmarine from gaining <font color="#dcdcdc">control of more

</font>would take over one unit (KG 40) after Hitler's intervention,
but Göring would soon regain it. <font color="#556b2f">Göring's
lack of cooperation </font>hampered a single air strategy that could
have a decisive strategic impact on Britain. Instead, he wasted
Fliegerführer Atlantik (Fliegerführer Atlantik) aircraft on bombing
the British mainland instead of attacking convoys. Goering felt that
his authority had suffered from the defeat of the Battle of Britain,
and he wanted to regain it <font color="#6b8e23">by subduing Britain

support the Directive 23 strategy was based on two factors, both of
which had little to do with the desire to destroy Britain's sea links

assessing the impact of bombing on war production </font>was becoming
apparent, and second, the OKL's <font color="#dcdcdc">conclusion that
British morale was unlikely to be shattered </font>led the OKL to
choose the naval option. The OKL's indifference to Directive 23 was
perhaps best reflected in the operational guidance that diluted its
impact. They stressed that the strategic essence was to attack ports,
but called for maintaining <font color="#2f4f4f">pressure or shifting

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Luftwaffe was still able to
cause enormous damage. Once Germany had occupied Western Europe, the
British feared <font color="#a9a9a9">an increase in submarine and air
attacks </font>against Britain's sea lines. Such an event would have
serious consequences for the future course of the war if the Germans
succeeded. <font color="#dcdcdc">Liverpool </font>and its port became
an important destination for convoys from North America via the
Western approaches, bringing supplies and materials. A substantial
rail network distributed goods to the rest of the country. Operations
against Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz were successful. The air
raids sank <font color="#2f4f4f">39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of
shipping, with a </font>further 111,601 long tons (113,392 t)
damaged. Herbert Morrison, the Secretary of Homeland Security, was
also concerned about the breakdown in morale and noted the sense of
loss expressed by civilians. According to other sources, half of the
port's 144 berths were unusable and cargo unloading capacity had been
reduced by 75%. Roads and railways were closed and ships were unable
to leave the port. On 8 May 1941, <font color="#556b2f">57 ships
totalling </font>80 000 long tons (81 000 tonnes) were destroyed,
sunk or damaged. Some 66 000 houses were destroyed, 77 000 people
were left homeless, 1 900 people died and 1 450 were seriously
injured in one night. Until May 1941, the operations against London
could also have had a serious impact on morale. The population of
Hull Harbour became 'trekkers', people who left the cities en masse
before, during and after the attacks. However, the attacks failed to
stop or damage the railways or port facilities for long, even in the
port of London, which was the target of many of the attacks. The Port
of London in particular was an important target, as it accounted for
<font color="#6b8e23">a third of foreign trade.</font></p>

attacked. Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the
month, while Belfast, Hull and Cardiff were also hit. Cardiff was
bombed on three nights and Portsmouth city centre was destroyed in
five attacks. In September 1940, an average of <font color="#dcdcdc">40,000
</font>civilian homes were lost each week. In March 1941, 148 000
people were killed in two attacks on Plymouth and London. Although
badly damaged, British ports continued to support the war industry,
supplies from North America continued to pass through them, and the
Royal Navy continued to operate at Plymouth, Southampton and
Portsmouth. Plymouth, in particular, came under the heaviest attack
because of its <font color="#2f4f4f">vulnerable position on the south
coast </font>and its proximity to German air bases. On 10-11 March,
240 bombers dropped 193 tonnes of explosives and 46 000 incendiary
bombs. Many houses and commercial centres were badly damaged,
electricity was cut off, and five oil tanks and two warehouses
exploded. Nine days later, two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped
heavy bombs, including 160 tonnes of explosives and 32,000 firebombs.
Much of the city centre was destroyed. Port facilities were damaged,
but many bombs fell on the city itself. On 17 April, 250 bombers led
by KG 26 dropped 346 tonnes of explosives and 46 000 incendiary
bombs. The damage was extensive and the Germans also used <font color="#556b2f">air

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The military effectiveness of the
bombing varied. During the Blitz, the Luftwaffe dropped some <font color="#a9a9a9">45
000 short tons </font>(41 000 t) of bombs, disrupting production and
transport, reducing food supplies and destabilising British morale.
It also helped support the submarine blockade by sinking some <font color="#dcdcdc">58,000
long tons </font>(59,000 t) of destroyed shipping and 450,000 long
tons (460,000 t) of damaged shipping. Overall, <font color="#2f4f4f">however,
British production increased steadily throughout this period,
</font>although there were significant falls in April 1941, probably
influenced by the departure of workers from the Easter holiday,
according to the official British history. The official British
history of war production states that the major impact was on
deliveries of components rather than of complete equipment. In
aircraft production, the <font color="#556b2f">British were denied
the opportunity to meet the planned target of 2 500 aircraft per
month</font>, probably the greatest achievement of the bombing
campaign, because it forced the industry to decentralise. In April
1941, when British ports were targeted, rifle production fell by 25
%, loaded cartridge production by 4,6 % and small arms production by
4,5 %. The strategic impact on industrial cities varied; <font color="#6b8e23">most
took 10 to 15 days to </font>recover from heavy attacks, but Belfast
and Liverpool took longer. Birmingham took the war industry around
three months to recover from the attacks on Birmingham. The exhausted
population took three weeks to recover from the effects of the
attack.</p>

locked in national solidarity. </font>This image entered the
historiography of the Second World War <font color="#dcdcdc">in the
1980s and 1990s, particularly after the publication of Angus Calder's
The Myth of the Blitz (1991). </font>It was revived by both
right-wing and left-wing political groups in Britain during the
Falklands War, when it was part of a nostalgic narrative in which the
Second World War represented <font color="#2f4f4f">aggressive British
patriotism successfully defending democracy.</font> This image of the
people in the Blitz was and is powerfully portrayed in film, radio,
newspapers and magazines. At the time, it was a useful propaganda
tool for use at home and abroad. Historians' critical response to
this construct focused on what were seen as <font color="#556b2f">overstated
claims of righteous nationalism and national unity. </font>In Myth of
the Blitz, Calder uncovered <font color="#6b8e23">some

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">After the Coventry Blitz, the
Communist Party widely promoted <font color="#a9a9a9">the need for
bomb shelters. In particular, </font>many Londoners began to use <font color="#dcdcdc">the
tube </font>without permission as a shelter and sleep there overnight
until the next morning. The government was so concerned about the
sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist
Party in Coventry and London that the police were sent to seize the
Party's production facilities. Until November 1940, the government
opposed the centralised organisation of shelters for the population.
Home Secretary Sir John Anderson was replaced by Morrison shortly
after the Cabinet was reshuffled following the resignation of the
terminally ill Neville Chamberlain. Morrison warned <font color="#2f4f4f">that
he could not combat Communist unrest unless shelters were provided.</font>
He recognised the public's right to take over the underground
stations and approved plans to improve and extend them by building
tunnels. Yet many British citizens who had belonged to the Labour
Party, which had itself been passive on the issue, turned to the
Communist Party. The Communists tried to blame the <font color="#556b2f">rich
factory owners, big business and landowning interests for the </font>damage
and casualties of the Coventry raid and called for a negotiated
peace. Although they failed to gain much influence, the party's
membership had doubled by June 1941. &quot;The 'Communist threat' was
considered so significant that Herbert Morrison, with the support of
the Cabinet, ordered <font color="#6b8e23">the closure of the Daily
Worker and The Week, a Communist newspaper and magazine.</font></p>

However, the resentment of the self-imposed displacement of the rich

The reception committees were totally unprepared for the condition of

class hatred and reinforcing prejudice against the urban poor. Within
four months, <font color="#6b8e23">88% of evacuated mothers, 86% of
young children and 43% of schoolchildren </font>had returned home.

habitat be </font>designated at the time a species is listed as
threatened or <font color="#dcdcdc">within one year of being </font>listed
as threatened. In practice, most sites are designated several years
after listing. Between 1978 and 1986, the FWS regularly designated
critical habitat. In 1986, the <font color="#2f4f4f">Reagan
administration </font>issued an executive order limiting the
protection status of critical habitat. As a result, few critical
habitats were designated between 1986 and the late 1990s. In the late
1990s and early 2000s, <font color="#556b2f">a series of court
decisions </font>overturned the Reagan regulations and forced the FWS

</font><font color="#228b22">and other western states. </font>In the
Midwest and Eastern states, fewer critical habitats were designated,
<font color="#191970">mostly in riverine and coastal areas.</font> As
of December 2006, the Reagan regulation has not yet been replaced,
although its use has been suspended. However, agencies have generally
changed course and, since 2005, have sought to designate critical
habitat at or near the time of designation.</p>

refers to <font color="#a9a9a9">how close it is to a complete vacuum</font>.

</font><font color="#dcdcdc">Ancient Greek </font>philosophers
debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of
atomism, where <font color="#2f4f4f">vacuum and the atom </font>were
the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. After Plato, even
the abstract notion of a featureless vacuum met with considerable
scepticism: it could not be perceived by <font color="#556b2f">the
senses</font>, it could not in itself provide any additional
explanatory power beyond the physical volume to which it was
proportional, and by definition it was literally nothing and <font color="#6b8e23">could

Early theories of light assumed that light was propagated by a

sought to detect the <font color="#6b8e23">small gravitational pull

gauges </font>(such as the mercury column manometer) consist of a
vertical column of liquid in a tube, the ends of which are exposed to
different pressures. The column rises or falls until its weight is
balanced by the pressure difference between the two ends of the tube.
The simplest structure is a U-shaped closed tube with one side

tube, but mercury is preferred because of <font color="#dcdcdc">its

preceded by the Qin dynasty (221-207 BC) and followed by the <font color="#dcdcdc">Three

more than four centuries, is considered the golden age of Chinese
history. Even today, the majority ethnic group in China calls itself
the 'Han people' and the Chinese script 'Han characters'. It was
founded by the rebel leader <font color="#2f4f4f">Liu Bang</font>,
posthumously known as Han Emperor Gaozu, and was briefly interrupted
by the Xin dynasty of former ruler Wang Mang (9-23 AD). This
interregnum divided the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han

society. He led the Han government, but shared power with both the
nobility and the appointed ministers, who came largely <font color="#a9a9a9">from

regions, directly controlled by the central government using an
innovation inherited from the Qin called <font color="#dcdcdc">command
counties, and </font>a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These
kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence,
especially <font color="#2f4f4f">after the Seven Kingdoms Rebellion</font>.
From the reign of Emperor Wu onwards, the Chinese court officially
supported <font color="#556b2f">Confucianism </font>in education and

private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these state
monopolies were abolished during the <font color="#556b2f">Eastern

known as the Silk Road, which extended as far as the Mediterranean
world. The areas north of the Han borders were quickly conquered by
the nomadic Xianbei Confederacy. Emperor Wu also launched successful

implemented a series of reforms from 145 BC onwards, limiting the

founded in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology of Confucius, or
Kongzi (551-479 BC), Han Confucianism during the reign of Emperor Wu
was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BC). Dong was a learned

ritual, filial piety and harmonious relationships with the five
stages and yin-yang cosmology. Dong's synthesis justified the ruler's

cosmological cycles and five phases of yin and yang. Each organ of

a sign that the channels of qi or 'vital energy' leading to a
particular organ were disturbed. Consequently, Han doctors prescribed
medicines that were believed to correct this imbalance. For example,
since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase,
medicines associated with the wood phase could be used to heal the
organ associated with the fire phase. To this end, the <font color="#dcdcdc">physician

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Muslims believe that God revealed
the Koran to Muhammad through the angel <font color="#a9a9a9">Gabriel
</font>(<font color="#dcdcdc">Jibril</font>) gradually over a period

when he died. Muslims consider the Qur'an to be Muhammad's most
important miracle, proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a
series of divine messages that began with those revealed to Adam and
ended with Muhammad. The word &quot;Qur'an&quot; appears some <font color="#6b8e23">70

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The word qurʼān appears about 70
times in the Koran in different senses. It is the verb noun (maṣdar)
of the Arabic verb <font color="#a9a9a9">qaraʼa </font>(<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">قرأ</span></font>),
which means 'he read' or 'he recited'. The Syriac equivalent is
(<font face=""><span lang="ar-SA">ܩܪܝܢܐ</span></font>) <font color="#dcdcdc">qeryānā,
</font>which means 'to read the scriptures' or 'a lesson'. Although
some Western scholars attribute the word to the Syriac language, most
Muslim authorities consider the origin of the word to be qaraʼa
itself. Nevertheless, it had become an Arabic term by the time
Muhammad lived. The important meaning of the word is '<font color="#556b2f">recitation</font>',
as stated in an early passage of the Qurʼān: 'It is for us to
collect it and recite it (qurʼānahu).'</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to Islamic tradition,
Muhammad had his first revelation <font color="#a9a9a9">in the cave
of Hira </font>during one of his retreats in the mountains. After
that he had revelations for 23 years. According to Hadith and Muslim
history, after Muhammad had moved to <font color="#dcdcdc">Medina </font>and
formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his
companions to recite the Qur'an and to learn and teach the laws
revealed daily. It is said that some of the Quraysh captured in the
Battle of <font color="#2f4f4f">Badr </font>regained their freedom
after teaching some Muslims the simple scriptures of the time. Thus a
group of Muslims gradually became literate. As originally discussed,
the Qur'an was written on tablets, on bones and on the broad, flat
ends of <font color="#556b2f">date palm </font>leaves. Most surals
were in use among early Muslims, as they are mentioned in numerous
statements from both Sunni and Shiite sources relating to how
Muhammad used the Qur'an as a call to Islam, the way of prayer and
the way of recitation. However, the <font color="#6b8e23">Qur'an did
</font>not exist as a book at the time of Muhammad's death in 632.

&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">ummi</font>&quot;, which is traditionally
interpreted as &quot;<font color="#dcdcdc">illiterate&quot;, </font>but
the meaning is much more complex. Medieval commentators, such as
Al-Tabari, argued that the term had two meanings: firstly, the
inability to read or write in general and secondly, inexperience or
ignorance of previous books or writings (but they gave preference to
the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as a sign of the
authenticity of his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr
al-Din al-Raz, if Muhammad had been able to <font color="#2f4f4f">read
and write, he </font>might have been suspected of having studied the
books of the ancestors. Some scholars, such as Watt, prefer another
meaning of &quot;umm&quot; - they believe it refers to his lack of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">According to earlier reports, in
632, after Muhammad's death, a number of his companions who knew the
Qur'an by heart were killed in the battle of Musaylimah, and the
first caliph <font color="#a9a9a9">Abu Bakr </font>(<font color="#dcdcdc">d.
</font><font color="#2f4f4f">634) </font>decided to collect the book
in a single volume in order to preserve it. <font color="#556b2f">Zayd
ibn Thabit </font>(d. 655) was the person who collected the Qur'an
because &quot;he used to write with divine inspiration on behalf of
Allah's Apostle&quot;. Thus, a group of scribes, Zayd being the most
important, collected the verses and produced a handwritten manuscript
of the entire book. According to Zayd, the manuscript remained with
Abu Bakr until his death. Zayd's reaction to the task and the
difficulties of collecting the Qur'an from parchments, palm leaves,
thin stones and men who knew it by heart are recorded in earlier
accounts. After Abu Bakr, the manuscript was entrusted to <font color="#6b8e23">Hafsa
bint Umar</font>, Muhammad's widow. Around 650, the third caliph
<font color="#a0522d">Uthman ibn Affan </font>(d. 656) began to
notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Qur'an as Islam
expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant and
North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he
ordered a committee led by Zayd to use a copy of Abu Bakr and to
produce a standard copy of the Qur'an. Thus the Qur'an was written
within 20 years of Muhammad's death. This text became the model from
which copies were made and distributed throughout the urban centres
of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been
destroyed. Muslim scholars accept the current form of the Qur'anic
text as the original version written by Abu Bakr.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Qur'anic inimitability (or &quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">I'jaz&quot;)
</font>is the belief that no human speech matches the Qur'an in
content and form. Muslims regard the Qur'an as an inimitable miracle,
valid <font color="#dcdcdc">until </font><font color="#2f4f4f">the
day of resurrection - and </font>thus as the central proof granted to
Muhammad to prove his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability
comes from the Qur'an, where in five different verses opponents are
challenged to produce something like the Qur'an: &quot;If men and
spirits were to join forces to produce something like this Qur'an,
they would never produce anything like it, even if they supported
each other.&quot; So the suggestion is that if there is any doubt
about the divine authorship of the Quran, step forward and create
something like it. From the ninth century onwards, numerous works
appeared examining the Qur'an and examining its style and content.
Medieval Muslim scholars, such as <font color="#556b2f">al-Jurjani
</font>(d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d. <font color="#6b8e23">1013),
</font>wrote treatises on the subject, discussed various aspects of
it and used linguistic approaches to study the Qur'an. Others argue
that the Qur'an contains noble ideas, has intrinsic meanings, has
retained its freshness over time and has caused great changes at the
individual level and in history. Some scholars argue that the Qur'an
contains scientific knowledge that agrees with modern science. The
Qur'an's doctrine of miracles is further underlined by Muhammad's
illiteracy, since an illiterate prophet could not have been suspected
of writing the Qur'an.</p>

in roughly <font color="#6b8e23">descending </font>order. The order
of the sura is therefore not related to the order of revelation. Each
sura except the ninth begins with <font color="#a0522d">Bismillah

</font>is a fundamental element of morality, and scholars have tried
to define the semantic content of &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;believer&quot;
in the Qur'an. The ethical-legal concepts and exhortations dealing
with righteous behaviour are linked to a profound awareness of God
and thus emphasise the importance of faith, responsibility and belief
in the ultimate encounter of every human being with God. People are
called upon to practice <font color="#dcdcdc">charity</font>,
especially towards the needy. Believers who &quot;spend their wealth
night and day, in secret and in public&quot; are promised that they
&quot;will receive their reward from their Lord; they shall not be
afraid nor need they be troubled&quot;. It also strengthens family
life by enacting laws on marriage, divorce and inheritance. Several
practices, such as <font color="#2f4f4f">usury and gambling, </font>are
banned. The Koran is one of the basic sources of Islamic law
(Sharia). The Qur'an devotes much attention to some formal religious
practices, such as formal prayers (<font color="#556b2f">salat) </font>and
fasting during <font color="#6b8e23">the month of Ramadan.</font> As
regards the way of performing prayer, the Qur'an refers to bowing
down to the ground. The expression <font color="#a0522d">for charity</font>,
zakat, literally means purification. According to the Qur'an, charity
is a means of self-purification.</p>

Guessoum is </font>highly critical of the pseudoscientific claims
made about the Quran, but he has stressed that the Quran encourages
science by developing the &quot;concept of knowledge&quot;. He
writes: &quot;The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecture
without evidence (Do not follow that of which you have no (certain)
knowledge...). 17:36) and in several verses asks Muslims to demand
evidence (Say: Bring <font color="#dcdcdc">your evidence </font>if
you are truthful 2:111) in matters of both theological faith and
science.&quot; Guessoum quotes <font color="#2f4f4f">Ghaleb Hasan as
</font>saying that &quot;<font color="#556b2f">proof&quot; </font>in
the Qur'an is &quot;clear and strong... convincing proof or
argument&quot;. Such proof cannot rely on an argument from authority
either, and he cites verse 5:104. Finally, both assertions and
rejections require evidence, according to verse 4:174. Ismail
al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani argue that the revival of Muslim
civilization must start from the Qur'an; however, the main obstacle
to this path is the &quot;centuries-old legacy of tafseerism
(exegesis) and other classical sciences&quot;, which prevents a
&quot;universal, epidemiological and systematic understanding&quot;
of the Qur'anic message. The philosopher <font color="#6b8e23">Muhammad

Islam (mostly non-Arabs) did not always understand the Arabic of the
Qur'an, they did not understand the references that were clear to
early Muslims fluent in Arabic, and they were concerned about
reconciling the apparent contradictions in the Qur'an. Skilled
commentators in Arabic explained the references and, perhaps most
importantly, explained which verses of the Qur'an had been revealed

Sufism goes beyond the apparent (<font color="#dcdcdc">zahir</font>)
point of the verses and instead relates the verses of the Qur'an to
the inner or esoteric (batin) and metaphysical dimensions of
consciousness and existence. According to Sands, esoteric
interpretations are suggestive rather than declarative, they are

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">One of the most important writers of
esoteric interpretation before the 1200s is <font color="#a9a9a9">Sulami
</font>(d. 1021), without whom most of the very early Sufi
commentaries would not have survived. Sulami's most important
commentary is a book called haqaiq al-tafsir ('<font color="#dcdcdc">Truths
of Exegesis</font>'), a collection of commentaries on the earlier
Sufis. From the 1100s onwards, several other works appeared,
including commentaries by Qushayr (d. 1074), Daylam (d. 1193), Shiraz
(d. 1209) and Suhraward (d. 1234). These works include material from
Sulam's books as well as the author's own contributions. Many works
are written in <font color="#2f4f4f">Persian</font>, such as the kash
al-asrar (&quot;Revelation of Secrets&quot;) of Maybud (d. 1135).
Rumi (d. <font color="#556b2f">1273) </font>wrote an enormous amount
of mystical poetry in his book Mathnawi. Rumi makes extensive use of
the Koran in his poems, which is sometimes omitted from translations
of Rumi's works. Mathnawi contains a large number of passages from
the Qur'an, and is considered by some to be a kind of Sufi
interpretation of the Qur'an. Rumi's book is not exceptional in the
sense that it contains quotations from the Qur'an and its
refinements, but Rumi nevertheless mentions the Qur'an more
frequently. Simnani (d. 1336) wrote two influential works on the
esoteric exegesis of the Qur'an. He reconciled notions of God's
manifestation through and in the physical world with the ideas of
Sunni Islam. The 17th century saw the appearance of comprehensive
Sufi commentaries, such as <font color="#6b8e23">Ismail Hakki
Bursev's </font>(d. 1725) work. His work ruh al-Bayan (Spirit of
Explanation) is a comprehensive exegesis. Written in Arabic, it
combines the author's own ideas with those of his predecessors
(notably Ibn Arabi and Ghazali), woven together in the Persian poetic
form of hafiz.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In the late 9th century, Arabic
introduced <font color="#a9a9a9">vowel signs</font> indicating
certain vowel sounds. The first manuscripts of the Qur'an lacked
these signs, which is why many of the utterances are still
acceptable. The nature of the missing vowel markings allowed the text
to be read in a variety of ways, which led to an increase in the
number of readings in the 10th century. The 10th century Muslim
scholar <font color="#dcdcdc">Ibn Mujāhid of </font>Baghdad is
famous for defining the seven acceptable textual readings of the
Qur'an. He studied the different ways of reading and their
reliability and selected seven <font color="#2f4f4f">8th century
</font>readings from the cities of Mecca, Medina, Kufa, Basra and
Damascus. Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers
instead of six or ten, but this may be related to the prophetic
tradition (saying of Muhammad) that the Qur'an was revealed in seven
&quot;ahrufs&quot; (meaning seven letters or ways). Today, the most
popular ways of reading are those transmitted by Ḥafṣ (d. 796)
and Warsh (d. 812), according to two reciters of Ibn Mujahid, Aasim
ibn Abi al-Najud (Kufa, d. 745) and Nafi' al-Madan (Medina, d. 785).
The influential Cairo Standard Qur'an (1924) uses a complex system of
modified vowel signs and a number of additional symbols for minor
details, and is based on the recitation of<font color="#556b2f">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Before the widespread introduction
of printing in the 19th century, the Koran was transmitted in
manuscripts <font color="#a9a9a9">by calligraphers and copyists</font>.
The earliest manuscripts were written in Ḥijāzī script. However,
the Hijazīz manuscripts confirm that the written transmission of the
Qur'an began at an early stage. It is likely that in the ninth
century, thicker lines, traditionally known as the <font color="#dcdcdc">Kufic
script, </font>began to be used. Towards the end of the ninth
century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Qur'an,
replacing the earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuing the
earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for
copies increased. Copiers therefore opted for simpler styles. From
the 1100s onwards, the <font color="#2f4f4f">Naskh</font>, Muhaqqaq
and Rayḥānī styles were mainly used and, less frequently, the
Thuluth script. Naskh was very widely used. <font color="#556b2f">In

specific is the Bihari script, which was used only in the northern
parts of India. Nastaʻlīq was also rarely used in the Persian

<font color="#a9a9a9">acceptable and unacceptable </font>esoteric
interpretations. <font color="#dcdcdc">Acceptable </font>ta'wil
refers to a meaning of a verse that is beyond its literal meaning;
rather, an implicit meaning that is ultimately known only to God and
cannot be understood directly through mere human reasoning. The
verses in question here refer to human qualities such as coming,
going, sitting, contentment, anger and sorrow, which are obviously
associated with God. <font color="#2f4f4f">Unacceptable </font>ta'wil
means that the apparent meaning of a verse is &quot;transferred&quot;
by means of testimony to another meaning; this method is not without
obvious inconsistencies. Although this unacceptable ta'wil has gained
considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to
Qur'anic verses. The correct interpretation is that of the reality
the verse refers to. It is found in all verses, both decisive and
ambiguous; it is not some meaning of a word; it is a fact too sublime
for words. God has clothed them with words to bring them a little
closer to our minds; in this respect they are like proverbs, used to
create a picture in our minds and thus help the hearer to understand
the clearly intended idea.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Koran probably existed in a
fragmentary written form during Muhammad's lifetime. Several sources
suggest that during Muhammad's lifetime, a large number of <font color="#a9a9a9">his
followers </font>had printed the revelations by heart. Early
commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the
above-mentioned view of the early development of the Qur'an. It is
generally agreed by academic scholars that the Qur'an in its present
form records the words uttered by <font color="#dcdcdc">Muhammad</font>,
since the search for variations has not yielded significant
differences.&quot; <font color="#2f4f4f">University of Chicago
</font>professor Fred Donner states that &quot;...very early attempts
were made to create a single consonantal Qur'anic text from what was
probably a larger and more diverse set of interrelated texts in the
early transmission [...] After the creation of this <font color="#556b2f">single
</font>canonical text, the earlier authoritative texts were
suppressed, and all surviving manuscripts - despite their numerous
variants - appear to date from a period after the creation of this
single consonantal text.&quot; Although most variant readings of the
Quranic text are no longer transmitted, some still exist. No critical
text on which to base a scientific reconstruction of the Qur'anic
text has been produced. Historically, controversy over the content of
the Qur'an has rarely arisen, although the subject is still debated.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Sahih al-Bukhari reports that
Muhammad described the revelations as follows, &quot;Sometimes it
(appears) like the ringing of a bell,&quot; and Aisha reported: &quot;I
saw when the Prophet received a divine inspiration on a very cold
day, and I noticed that sweat dripped from his forehead (when the
inspiration was over).&quot; According to the Qur'an, Muhammad's
first revelation was accompanied by a vision. The mediator of the
revelation is mentioned as a &quot;mighty power&quot; who &quot;shone
forth in sight when he was on the upper horizon&quot;. Then he drew
near and descended until he was (far away) <font color="#a9a9a9">two
bows </font>or even closer.&quot; Welch, a scholar of Islamic
studies, states in the<font color="#dcdcdc"> Encyclopaedia of Islam
</font>that he believes that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's
condition at these moments can be considered authentic because he was
severely shaken after these revelations. According to Welch, those
close to him would have regarded these <font color="#2f4f4f">scenes
as </font>convincing proof of the superhuman origin of Muhammad's
inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a
<font color="#556b2f">possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician</font>,
because his experiences were similar to the claims of such figures
who were well known in ancient Arabia. Welch also notes that it is
still uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after
Muhammad's initial proclamation as a prophet.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei says that
according to an explanation popular among later exegetes, ta'wil
indicates the specific meaning to which the verse is directed. The
meaning of the announcement (tanzil), unlike ta'wil, is clear because
it corresponds to the apparent meaning of the words as they were
announced. However, this explanation has become so widespread that
today it has become the primary meaning of ta'wil, which originally
meant <font color="#a9a9a9">&quot;return&quot; or &quot;place of
return&quot;. </font>For Tabatabaei, what has rightly been called
ta'wil, or <font color="#dcdcdc">hermeneutical </font>interpretation
of the Qur'an, is not simply a matter of the meaning of the words.
Rather, it is concerned with certain truths and realities that are
beyond the comprehension of ordinary people; yet it is from these
truths and realities that the doctrinal principles and practical
prescriptions of the Qur'an derive. Interpretation is not the meaning
of a verse - rather, it is manifested through that meaning, a kind of
special transpiracy. There is the <font color="#2f4f4f">spiritual
reality - which is the </font>main aim of the imposition of law or
the basic aim of the description of a divine attribute - and then
there is the actual meaning to which the Qur'anic narrative refers.</p>

by classical music and audiophiles, and its processing quality was
particularly praised. As the price of musical instruments gradually
fell and the portable Walkman came onto the market, the CD began to
gain popularity in the wider popular and rock music market. The first

that Bell Labs' first transistor patent be based on the field effect
and that he be named as the inventor. After Bell Labs' lawyers
discovered Lilienfeld's patents, which had gone unreported years
earlier, they objected to Shockley's proposal because the idea of a
field-effect transistor using an electric field as a &quot;network&quot;

first point-contact transistor in <font color="#8b0000">1947.</font>

of traditional Chinese governance when they ruled China proper.
Schoppa, editor of The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History,
argues: 'The date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is
thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'. It also
gives us a better starting point for understanding the sharp decline
of Chinese state power in the 19th and 20th centuries.&quot;</p>

Hideyoshi, </font>unlike the shogunates that preceded it. The <font color="#556b2f">daimyo,

samurai, and below them were farmers, craftsmen and merchants. In
some parts of the country, especially in smaller areas, daimyo and
samurai were more or less identical, as a daimyo could train as a
samurai and a samurai could serve as a local lord. Otherwise, the
largely inflexible nature of this system of social stratification
unleashed divisive forces over time. Peasant taxes were <font color="#a0522d">set
at fixed amounts </font>that did not take account of inflation or
other changes in the value of money. As a result, the <font color="#191970">value
of the tax revenues collected by samurai landowners declined over
time.</font> This often led to numerous clashes between noble but
impoverished samurai and wealthy peasants, ranging from simple local
disturbances to much larger rebellions. However, none of these proved
convincing enough to challenge the established order before the
arrival of foreign powers.</p>

The </font>Cossacks were <font color="#2f4f4f">warriors organised

Rebellion, because they were suffering social and religious
oppression under Polish rule. In 1654, Ukrainian leader Bohdan
Khmelnitsky offered to place Ukraine under the protection of Russian
Tsar Alexei I. Alexey's acceptance led to a new Russo-Polish war
(1654-1667), and eventually Ukraine was divided along the Dnieper
River, leaving the western part (i.e. the right-hand side of Ukraine)
under Polish rule and the eastern part (the left-hand side of Ukraine
and Kiev) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670-71, the Don Cossacks led
by Stenka Razin launched a major rebellion in the Volga region, but
the Tsar's troops managed to defeat the rebels. In the east, rapid
Russian exploration and colonisation of the vast Siberian territories
was led mainly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory.
Russian explorers moved eastwards mainly along Siberian river routes,
and by the mid-16th century Russian colonies were established in
eastern Siberia, the Chukchi peninsula, along the Amur River and on
the Pacific coast. In 1648, the Bering Strait between Asia and North
America was first crossed by Fedot Popov and Semyon Dehnyov.</p>

Germany, Italy and Spain established a small number of colonies
across the continent, including German East Africa (Tanganyika) and
German Southwest Africa, Eritrea and Libya for Germany, and the
Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in Northwest Africa for Spain. King
Leopold (reigned 1865-1909) also had a large 'piece of the great cake
of Africa', the Congo, which unfortunately for the Congolese became
his personal fiefdom to use as he saw fit in Central Africa. By 1914,
almost the entire continent was under European control. Liberia,
where freed American slaves had settled in the 1820s, and Abyssinia
(Ethiopia) in East Africa were the last remaining independent African
states (John Merriman, A History of Modern Europe, Volume Two: From

Japan, the Meiji Restoration began <font color="#556b2f">in the

themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on
questions of discontinuity and continuity with the previous Tokugawa
period. In the 1960s, younger Japanese scholars, led by Irokawa
Daikichi, reacted against <font color="#6b8e23">the bureaucratic
superstate </font>and began to search for the historical role of the
common people. They shunned the elite and focused on social forces
and attitudes rather than political events. They rejected both
Marxism and modernisation theory as alien and limiting. They stressed
the importance of popular forces in the development of modern Japan.
They extended history by using the methods of social history. It was
only at the beginning of the Meiji period that the Japanese
government began to take modernisation seriously. Japan expanded its
military production base by opening arsenals in various locations.
The Hyobusho (War Office) was replaced by the War Ministry and the
Navy Department. The samurai class experienced a great disappointment
in the following years.</p>

Enlightenment, which began a hundred years before the 20th century,
was questioned in <font color="#a9a9a9">various quarters around the

from <font color="#dcdcdc">earlier secular traditions, </font>affirmed
the dignity and worth of all human beings, based on the ability to
determine right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities,
especially rationality, without recourse to the supernatural or to
supposed divine authority derived from religious texts. For liberal
humanists like Rousseau and Kant, the universal law of reason pointed
the way towards total liberation from tyranny of any kind. These
ideas were challenged, for example, by the young Karl Marx, who
criticised the project of political emancipation (which took the form
of human rights) and claimed that it <font color="#2f4f4f">was a
symptom of the very dehumanisation it was intended to oppose. </font>For
Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism was nothing more than a <font color="#556b2f">secular
version of theism. </font>In his Genealogy of Morality, he argues
that human rights exist <font color="#6b8e23">as a means by which the
weak can collectively restrain the strong.</font> According to this
view, such rights do not facilitate the emancipation of life but
rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that humans are
rationally autonomous was challenged by the notion that humans are
driven by unconscious irrational desires.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, the crisis did not come out
of nowhere, but was the result of a long series of diplomatic clashes
between the great powers in the decade before 1914 over European and
colonial issues, which had caused tensions. These diplomatic clashes
were the result of changes in the balance of power in Europe since
1870. An example is the Baghdad railway, which was intended to link
<font color="#a9a9a9">the Ottoman cities of Konya and Baghdad on a
line through present-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq.</font> The railway
became a source of international controversy in the years immediately
preceding the First World War. Although it has been argued that they
were settled in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued
that the railway was the cause of the First World War. In essence,
the war was sparked by <font color="#dcdcdc">tensions over the
Balkans. </font>Austria-Hungary competed with <font color="#2f4f4f">Serbia
and Russia </font>for territory and influence in the region, and they
drew other major powers into the conflict through their various
alliances and treaties. The Balkan Wars were two wars fought in

1913, during which the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece

Britain, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose
it as an ally. In any case, the little action taken by the Western
powers drove Mussolini's Italy to ally itself with Hitler's Germany.
The Abyssinian War showed Hitler how weak the League was and
encouraged the remilitarisation of the Rhineland in flagrant

provocative acts that culminated in the invasion of Poland in
September 1939 and the start of the Second World War.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">The Cold War was a period of both
<font color="#a9a9a9">tension and relative peace. </font>International
crises arose, such as the Berlin Blockade (<font color="#dcdcdc">1948-1949)</font>,
the Korean War (<font color="#2f4f4f">1950-1953)</font>, the Berlin

the Cuban Missile Crisis (<font color="#6b8e23">1962)</font>, the
Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979-1989) and the NATO exercises of
November 1983. There were also periods of de-escalation as both sides
sought conciliation. Direct military attacks against adversaries were
prevented by the prospect of mutually assured destruction by means of
portable nuclear weapons. In the Cold War era, the generation of love
and the rise of computers transformed society in very different and
complex ways, such as increasing social and local mobility.</p>

of time that covers the activities related to the space race, space

</font>Sputnik 1. This was the world's first artificial satellite,
which orbited the Earth <font color="#2f4f4f">in 98.1 minutes and

era of political, scientific and technological achievement known as
the Space Age. The Space Age was characterised by the rapid
development of new technologies, mainly in the context of fierce
competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. The <font color="#556b2f">space
age saw the </font>first human spaceflights during the Vostok
programme and reached its peak with the Apollo programme, which
captured the imagination of a large part of the world's population.
The landing of Apollo 11 was watched by more than <font color="#6b8e23">500
million </font>people around the world and is widely recognised as
one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then, and with
the end of the space race following the collapse of the Soviet Union,
public attention has largely shifted to other areas.</p>

refers to Puerto Rico as <font color="#a9a9a9">the </font>&quot;<font color="#a9a9a9">Commonwealth
of </font>Puerto <font color="#dcdcdc">Rico&quot;</font>. The 1952
Constitution of Puerto Rico gave its political structure the name
<font color="#2f4f4f">Estado Libre Asociado (literally translated as
&quot;Free Associated State&quot;), which is </font>officially
translated into English as Commonwealth. The island is covered by the
<font color="#556b2f">territorial clause of the </font>US
<font color="#556b2f">Constitution, which has </font>led to doubts
about the finality of Puerto Rico's Commonwealth status. In addition,
all persons born in Puerto Rico become US <font color="#6b8e23">citizens
</font>at birth (under the provisions of the Jones-Shafroth Act of
1917), but citizens of Puerto Rico cannot vote for President or for
ordinary members of either house of Congress. Statehood would give
islanders full voting rights at the federal level. The <font color="#a0522d">Puerto
Rico Democracy Act (H.R. 2499) was </font>passed by the US House of
Representatives on 29 April 2010 by a vote of 223-169, but was not
passed by the Senate before the end of the 111th Congress. It would
have provided for the federally approved sovereignty of the people of
Puerto Rico. The Act would provide for referendums in Puerto Rico to
determine the final political status of the island. It was also
proposed in 2007.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Washington D.C. is often mentioned
as a candidate for a separate state. In <font color="#a9a9a9">Federalist
</font>Papers, <font color="#a9a9a9">Federalist No. 43, </font><font color="#dcdcdc">James
Madison </font>pondered the implications of the definition of &quot;seat
of government&quot; in the US Constitution. Although he noted the
potential conflicts of interest and the &quot;necessity of a
municipal legislature for local purposes,&quot; Madison did not
address the role of the district in the national vote. Legal scholars
disagree as to whether a county can be admitted as a state by a mere
act of <font color="#2f4f4f">Congress</font>, since it is the seat of
US government, which Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution
requires to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress.
Depending on the interpretation of this text, the recognition of an
entire county as a state may require a constitutional amendment,
which is much more difficult to achieve. However, <font color="#556b2f">the
constitution does not set a minimum size for </font><font color="#6b8e23">a
district</font>. Its size has already changed once before, when
<font color="#a0522d">Virginia regained the part of the county south
of the Potomac River.</font> The constitutional requirement for a
federal district can therefore be met by reducing the size of the
district to a small central unit of government buildings and
monuments and ceding the rest of the territory to the new state.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This has a historical basis, dating
back to the break-up of British America during the American
Revolution. The colonies that joined the United States invaded Canada
(at the time the term referred specifically to the present-day
provinces of Quebec and Ontario, which had only been under British
control since <font color="#a9a9a9">1763</font>) at least twice, but
neither of them succeeded in taking control of the territory. The
first invasion took place during the Revolution on the assumption
that the supposed hostility of French-speaking Canadians to the
British colonial administration, combined with the Franco-American
alliance, would make them natural allies for the American cause; <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Continental Army </font>successfully recruited two Canadian regiments
for the invasion. The failure of the attack forced the members of
these regiments into exile, and they settled mainly in upstate New
York. The Articles of Confederation drawn up during the Revolution
included a provision that Canada could join the United States if it
ever decided to do so, without having to ask the permission of the
United States, as other states would have had to do. The United
States invaded Canada again during the <font color="#556b2f">War of
1812</font>, but this attempt was hampered by the large number of
Loyalist Americans who had fled to what is now Ontario and continued
to oppose joining the Republic. The Hunter Patriots in the 1830s and
the Fenian raids after the American Civil War were private attacks on
Canada from the United States. In the 19th century, several US
politicians also spoke out in favour of <font color="#6b8e23">Canadian
annexation.</font></p>

metal conductors (elements) electrically connected (often via <font color="#a9a9a9">a

oscillating <font color="#dcdcdc">electron current </font>forced
through the antenna by the transmitter creates an oscillating
magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge on the
electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the
elements. These time-varying fields <font color="#2f4f4f">radiate
away from </font>the antenna into space as a moving transverse
electromagnetic field wave. During <font color="#556b2f">reception</font>,
the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio

the context of wireless devices comes from the Italian pioneer of
radio technology, <font color="#a9a9a9">Guglielmo Marconi</font>. In
the summer of <font color="#dcdcdc">1895, </font>Marconi began
testing his wireless system outdoors on his father's farm near
Bologna and soon began experimenting with long wire 'antennas'.
Marconi found that <font color="#2f4f4f">by raising the aerial wire
</font>above the ground and connecting one end of the transmitter to
the ground, the transmission range increased. Soon he was able to
send signals over a hill, some 2.4 kilometres away. In Italian, the
tent pole is known as l'antenna centrale, and the pole with the wire
was simply called l'antenna. Until then, wireless transmitting and
receiving elements were simply called antennas or terminals.</p>

antenna is the very common vertical antenna, which consists of <font color="#a9a9a9">a
metal rod </font>(often, but not always, a quarter of a wavelength
long). A dipole antenna is similar, but consists of two wires
extending in opposite directions, often, but not always, half a

<font color="#2f4f4f">horizontally, making them </font>weakly

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Both vertical and dipole antennas
are simple in design and <font color="#a9a9a9">relatively
inexpensive</font>. The <font color="#dcdcdc">dipole antenna, which
</font>is the basis of most antenna designs, is a balanced component
with two terminals receiving equal but opposite voltages and currents
via a balanced transmission line (or a coaxial transmission line via
a so-called balun). A vertical antenna, on the other hand, is a
<font color="#2f4f4f">monopole antenna.</font> It is typically
connected to the inner conductor of the coaxial transmission line (or
to the matching network); the transmission line shield is connected
to ground. In this way, the ground (or any <font color="#556b2f">large
conductive surface) acts as a </font>second conductor of the dipole,
thus forming a complete circuit. Since monopole antennas are based on
conducting ground, a so-called grounding structure can be used, which
provides a better grounding contact to the ground or which itself
acts as a ground plane and performs this function regardless of
whether actual contact to the ground is present (or absent).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">More complex antennas than dipole or
vertical models usually aim to increase the directionality and thus
the <font color="#a9a9a9">gain of the antenna</font>. This can be
achieved in many different ways, leading to a wide variety of antenna
designs. The majority of designs are fed by <font color="#dcdcdc">a
balanced line </font>(as opposed to a monopole) and are based on a
dipole antenna with added components (or elements) to increase its
directivity. The antenna &quot;gain&quot; in this case describes <font color="#2f4f4f">the
concentration of </font>radiated power at a fixed angle in space, as
opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of an ideal radiator.
The increase in power in the desired direction occurs at the expense
of power in the undesired direction. The power is conserved and there
is no net increase in power compared to the power from the power
source (<font color="#556b2f">transmitter</font>).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">For example, a phased array consists
of <font color="#a9a9a9">two or more </font>simple antennas connected
to each other via an electrical network. Often these are several
dipole antennas in <font color="#dcdcdc">parallel</font>, spaced at a
certain distance apart. Depending on the <font color="#2f4f4f">relative
phase </font>provided by the network, the same dipole antenna array
may act as a 'broadside array' (oriented normal to the line
connecting the elements) or as an 'end array' (oriented along the
line connecting the elements). Antenna arrays may use any basic
antenna type (<font color="#556b2f">omni-directional or weakly

elements are often identical.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">However, <font color="#a9a9a9">a

of different lengths to provide a somewhat directional antenna with a
<font color="#dcdcdc">very wide bandwidth</font>: these are often
used <font color="#2f4f4f">for TV reception </font>in fringe areas.
The dipole antennas that make it up are considered 'active elements'
because they are all electrically connected to each other (and to the
transmission line). On the other hand, a superficially similar dipole
array, the <font color="#556b2f">Yagi-Uda antenna </font>(or simply
&quot;Yagi&quot;), has only one dipole element that is electrically
coupled; the other so-called parasitic elements interact with the
electromagnetic field to produce a relatively directional antenna,
but limited to a relatively narrow bandwidth. The Yagi antenna has
similar parasitic dipole elements, but they work differently because
they are slightly different in length. There may be several so-called
&quot;guides&quot; in front of the active element in the direction of
propagation and usually one (but possibly more) &quot;reflector&quot;
on the opposite side of the active element.</p>

(or poorly directional) antennas can often be made more gain by
concentrating more power in <font color="#2f4f4f">horizontal

radio waves with a certain <font color="#a9a9a9">polarisation</font>,
which in many (but not all) cases can be reoriented <font color="#dcdcdc">by

antenna is often a practical problem, especially at <font color="#2f4f4f">lower

directional </font>antennas need to be significantly larger than the
wavelength. Resonant antennas usually use a linear conductor (or
element) or a pair of elements, each about a quarter wavelength long
(the odd multiple of a quarter wavelength is also resonant).
Antennas, which must be <font color="#6b8e23">small </font>relative
to the wavelength, lose efficiency and cannot be very directional.
Fortunately, at higher frequencies (UHF, microwaves), performance

low Q usually means excessive loss (due to unwanted resistance) in
the L-C resonant circuit. However, this notion does not apply to

subfamilies Magnoliopsida, Liliopsida and Rosopsida. The Takhtajan

Dahlgren system and Thorne's system (1992) treat this group at the

fertilisation </font>is the process where <font color="#dcdcdc">two

tube. </font>As the pollen tube grows, the <font color="#6b8e23">haploid
</font>gamete travels along the tube behind the nucleus of the tube.
The generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid (n)
spermatozoa. As the pollen tube grows, it travels from the stamen,
along the ovary and into the ovary. There, the pollen tube reaches
the micropyle of the oocyte and fuses with <font color="#a0522d">the
synergid</font>, releasing its contents (which include sperm cells).
The <font color="#228b22">synergid in which the </font>cells were
released degenerates, and one spermatozoon passes to fertilise the
egg cell, resulting in a diploid (2n) zygote. The second sperm cell
fuses with the <font color="#191970">nuclei of both central cells</font>,
resulting in a triploid (3n) cell. When the zygote develops into an
embryo, the triploid cell develops into an <font color="#8b0000">endosperm,

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Traditionally, flowering plants have
been divided into <font color="#a9a9a9">two </font>groups, which in
the Cronquist system are called <font color="#dcdcdc">the
Magnoliopsida </font>(the class consisting of the family name
Magnoliaceae) and the Liliopsida (the class consisting of the family
name Liliaceae). Other descriptive names allowed by Article 16 of the
ICBN are <font color="#2f4f4f">Dicotyledones or Dicotyledoneae and
Monocotyledones or Monocotyledoneae, which have a </font>long history
of use. In English, members of either group may be called
dicotyledons (plural dicotyledons) and monocotyledons (plural
monocotyledons) or, for short, dicotyledons (plural dicotyledons) and
monocotyledons (plural monocotyledons). These names derive from the
observation that dicots usually have two <font color="#556b2f">cotyledons</font>,
or embryonic leaves, in each seed. Monocots usually have only one,
but the rule is not absolute in either case. From a diagnostic point
of view, the number of cotyledons <font color="#6b8e23">is not a
particularly convenient or reliable characteristic.</font></p>
